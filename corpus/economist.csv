 Jan 26th 2023,Have economists misunderstood inflation?,Imagine it is late 2024 Inflation in the rich world has fallen from its peak but stayed stubbornly high At around 4% it is well above the level at which most central banks are comfortable Governments weighed down by vast debts must use precious revenues to pay interest on the debt which itself is growing because of high interest rates The energy transition and rising state spending owing to ageing populations add to the fiscal largesse Raising taxes is politically fraught so more money is printed Inflation stays high and governments’ credibility worsens Central bankers are scratching their heads wondering how their powerful weaponthe interest ratehas failed so thoroughlyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA wonkish theory laid out in glorious detail in a new book by John Cochrane of Stanford University Hoover Institution would offer a potential explanation “The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level” builds a theory of inflation as ambitious as that proposed by John Maynard Keynes “The General Theory” or Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz “A Monetary History” Mr Cochrane whose own work on the subject spans four decades spends nearly 600 pages reworking the maths of past economic models to incorporate fiscal theory while chattily discussing how it explains past inflationary episodes “[E]ven Milton Friedman might change his mind with new facts and experience at hand” he speculatesAt the heart of Mr Cochrane theory is the idea that government debt can be valued like a firm equity based on the returns to its owner pockets The price level will adjustand therefore drive inflation or deflationto ensure that the real value of the debt equals the sum of a government future budget surpluses appropriately discounted Thus the true driver of inflation is government debt not monetary policy Under this theory money is valuable because it can be used to pay tax and generate surpluses The set-up is not all that different from the gold standard except it is tax rather than gold that backs money Mr Cochrane is careful to note that the adjustment of the price level is not instantaneous People can be poor judges of a government credibility when it comes to paying off debts Just like stocks prices are able to deviate from fundamentals Yet in the long run they adjust A government that hands out money without eventually running surpluses will not avoid inflation for ever History appears to offer support Brad DeLong of the University of California Berkeley uses fiscal theory in his recent book “Slouching towards Utopia” to explain inflation in post-first-world-war Europe In France hefty debt-interest payments led to an average of 20% annual inflation over seven years In Germany things were worse The public lost faith in the ability of the state to pay off its debts without inflation Soon hyperinflation kicked in Mr Cochrane also brings fiscal theory to bear on America inflation in the 1970s-80s In the mid-1970s price rises exceeded 12% The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates; inflation dropped to 5% by 1977 Yet Mr Cochrane points out that inflation shot up again to more than 14% by 1980 in part because America failed to get its fiscal house in order Fiscal and regulatory reforms that raised expectations of future surpluses along with another dose of monetary medicine were needed to vanquish inflationHow is fiscal theory faring today? For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 prices stayed stubbornly low despite a ballooning supply of money and interest rates sitting at or below zero in much of the rich world A “crude monetarism” predicted an inflationary surge which did not materialise Other revamped “New Keynesian” models also proved unhelpful When governments spent big during the covid-19 pandemic many economists reasoning from recent history were sanguine about the possibility of inflationMr Cochrane argues fiscal theory can explain both the period of low inflation and the return of rapidly rising prices after the pandemic Inflation was meagre in the 2010s despite soaring government debts because politicians promised to get their books in order and low interest rates meant consumers and bondholders were willing to wait Yet during the pandemic governments took a different approach They dropped enormous cheques into consumers’ pockets The Fed purchased government debt immediately after its issuance There was little talk of sustainability Mr Cochrane argues that the direct nature of these “helicopter drops” informed people their newly fat pockets would not be drained by future taxes Thus they were more willing to spendHeads I win tails you loseThis story is perhaps too convenient Indeed Mr Cochrane admits that fiscal theory flaw is it offers a way of explaining nearly any series of historical events in an unfalsifiable manner Yes other theories of inflation have problems But if it is so hard to prove fiscal theory wrong are they really in a fair fight? Mr Cochrane story of how inflation ended in the 1980s is complicated by the fact that America actually cut taxes suggesting politicians were not all that concerned by balanced budgets Although deregulation may have boosted growth many economists think the budget surpluses of the 1990s were mainly caused by globalisation and an it boom which few consumers in the 1980s saw comingFiscal theory also offers limited guidance to policymakers beyond what is already well-known Under its approach monetary policy remains important: interest rates can spread out an increase in the price level over a period of time In addition the theory suggests governments must maintain credibility when it comes to paying off their debtshardly a radical idea Fast-forward once again to late 2024 Imagine this time inflation has fallen to 2% Interest rates are slowly coming down Central bankers are running a victory lap What of fiscal theory?

 Jan 26th 2023,What inflation means for the Big Mac index,For much of the past two years economists have argued fiercely about prices As inflation in America and elsewhere has exceeded central-bank targets analysts have dissected different components of the cost of living including the prices of goods services energy and rents Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut what about the Big Mac? The iconic McDonald burger is an amalgam of rent electricity and labour as well as beef bread and cheese Its price is therefore indicative of broader inflationary pressures And because the burger is basically the same wherever you are in the world its price can also reveal how inflation has changed the relative costliness of different countriesIn America for example the median price of a Big Mac has risen by more than 6% to an average of $536 in the past two years The price tends to be a bit higher in big cities According to the theory of purchasing-power parity when a country prices rise its currency should fall everything else equal This stops the country prices moving too far out of line with those elsewhere in the world Yet the dollar has risen not fallen over the past two years against the currencies of most other big economies A trade-weighted exchange-rate index published by America Federal Reserve increased by more than 9% from December 2020 to December 2022 One reason for this is that inflation has also returned to lots of America trading partners Indeed in many places it is worse Big Mac prices have risen by 14% over the past two years in the euro area and by 15% in Britain But the dollar rise against the euro and pound has been more than required to offset this inflation gapThe combination of rising prices and a rising currency threatens to move American prices out of whack with those elsewhere in the world Two years ago for example the Big Mac was 26% cheaper in Japan than America In principle this suggests the yen was undervalued and should have risen against the dollar In fact the opposite occurred A Big Mac is now more than 40% cheaper in Japan There are exceptions where the theory of purchasing-power parity has held Although Argentina peso has fallen against the dollar prices in the country have risen even faster A Big Mac now costs the equivalent of $531 That is high compared with the price two years ago and also compared with today price in Brazil $444 If the two Latin American countries were to form a currency union at today exchange rate Argentina would find itself at a hefty competitive disadvantage It would be almost 20% more expensive than its larger neighbour at least judging by burger pricesThe Economist has been making comparisons of this kind since 1986 Converting Big Mac prices into dollars always reveals big differences in the cost of the same burger in different countries One measure of the “fair value” of a currency is the exchange rate that would eliminate these gaps But of course exchange rates are not the only thing that can adjust Prices can also rise faster in one country than another In the long era of low inflation this was not where the action was Over the past two years prices have been on the move in many countries Unfortunately these bouts of inflation have done little to move burger prices closer together For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 26th 2023,When professional stockpickers beat the algorithms,Last year plunging markets left few investors smiling Stocks and bonds fell in tandem; haven assets failed to offer safe harbour Doing well meant making single-figure percentage losses rather than double It might therefore seem an odd time for fund managers to be walking with a spring in their step Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut on January 23rd it emerged that Citadel a secretive investment firm based in Miami had generated $16bn in net profits for its clients in 2022 breaking the record for the largest annual gain in dollar terms Its main hedge fund posted a 38% returnwhile msci broadest index of global stocks declined by 18% Champagne corks were popping elsewhere too Strategas Securities a brokerage and research firm reckons that 62% of active fund managers investing in large American firms beat the s&p 500 index of such shares in 2022 the highest percentage since 2005 Last year therefore snapped a miserable losing streak for stockpickers Every year from 2010 to 2021 more than half of active managers who benchmarked their performance against the s&p 500 failed to beat it In other words the average fund manager was outclassed by a simple algorithm blindly buying every stock in the index Such algorithmsknown as “passive” or “index” fundsare taking over By 2021 they held 43% of the assets managed by American investment companies and owned a greater share of the country stockmarket than their actively managed counterpartsThe logic that drives passive funds is inescapable By definition the performance of an index is the average of those who own the underlying stocks Beating an index is a zero-sum game If one investor does another must lose out Active managers may spot a superstar stock that ends up leaving the rest in the dust But it will also be in the index so passive investors will buy it too Meanwhile active managers tend to charge fees that are orders of magnitude higher than passive ones: often 1-2% a year and more for whizzy hedge funds compared with as little as 003% for their algorithmic peers This drag on performance makes it all but inevitable that index funds will outpace human money managers in the long runSo how did fund managers outperform in 2022? One possibility is sheer luck Pick a group of stocks from an index at random subtract a percentage point or two from their returns for fees and occasionally you will have chosen shares that do well enough to beat the averageA variation on this allows for some skill on the stockpicker part At the start of 2022 Alphabet Amazon Apple Microsoft and Tesla accounted for nearly a quarter of the total market capitalisation of the s&p 500 Their collective value dropped by 38% over the year; that of the rest of the index dropped by just 15% So concentrated was the index that a single good judgmentthinking the shares of America tech giants were frothy and to be avoidedwould have left a stockpicker with a decent chance of beating the marketBroadening out this tech queasiness to a more general worry about stock valuations would have given stockpickers a second chance to outperform Quibbling about such things went out of fashion during the years of cheap money that followed the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and then covid-19 Share prices soared to eye-watering multiples of the underlying companies’ earnings or assets then kept climbing Those who took that as a signal to shun them in anticipation of a correction lost out Passive funds that indiscriminately bought everything including stocks which seemed overpriced prospered But in 2022 rising interest rates brought the trend to an abrupt halt Investors who had hunted for stocks that were cheap relative to their fundamentals were at last rewardedFor firms like Citadel a final chance to prove their worth came from plummeting share and bond prices Market crashes and an uncertain economic backdrop are the raison d’être for hedge funds with a mandate to invest in any asset class they wish Stockmarket indices that are falling by double digits are a lot easier to beat if you aren’t obliged to buy stocks as are the funds which track the market And for the most nimble managers last year crises looked like opportunities As a convulsing sovereign-debt market forced British pension funds into fire-sales in September Apollo a private-investment firm started snapping up assets to book a quick profit Index funds are not going away and nor should they But just occasionally active managers are worth their feesRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Venture capital $300bn question Jan 18thThe dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

fallen by 7% a sign that fear about the global economy is ebbing Even bitcoin has had a good year Not long ago it felt as though a global recession was nailed on Now optimism is re-emerging Listen to

lower gas prices bye-bye recession” cheered analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank on January 18th in a report on the euro zone Nomura a Japanese lender has revised its forecast of Britain recession “to something less pernicious [than] what we originally expected” Citigroup another bank said that “the probability of a full-blown global recession in which growth in many countries turns down in tandem is now roughly 30% [in contrast with] the 50% assessment that we maintained through the second half of last year” These are crumbs: the world economy is weaker than at any point since the lockdowns of 2020 But investors will eat anything Forecasters are in part responding to real-time economic data Despite talk of a global recession since at least last February when Russia invaded Ukraine these have held up better than expected Consider a weekly estimate of gdp from the oecd a group of mostly rich countries which account for about 60% of global output It is hardly booming but in mid-January few countries were struggling see chart 1 Widely watched “purchasing-manager index” measures of global output rose slightly in January consistent with gdp growth of about 2%Official numbers remain mixed Recent figures on American retail and industry came in below expectations In Japan machinery orders were far weaker than forecast Yet after reaching an all-time low in the summer consumer confidence across the oecd has risen Shortly after we went to press officials were due to publish their first estimate of America gdp in the fourth quarter of 2022 Most economists were expecting a decent number though pandemic disruptions mean these figures will be less reliable than normal Labour markets seem to be holding up too In some rich countries including Austria and Denmark joblessness is risinga telltale sign that a recession is looming Barely a day goes by without an announcement from another big technology company that it is letting people go Yet tech accounts for a small share of overall jobs and in most countries unemployment remains low Happily in places where demand for labour is dropping employers are withdrawing job adverts rather than sacking people We estimate that since reaching an all-time high of more than 30m early last year unfilled vacancies across the oecd have fallen by about 10% Meanwhile the number of people actually in a job has fallen by less than 1% from its peak Investors pay attention to labour markets but they really care about right now is inflation It is too soon to know if this threat has passed In the rich world “core” inflation a measure of underlying pressure is still 5-6% year on year far higher than central banks find comfortable The problem though is no longer getting worse In America core inflation is coming down as is the share of small firms which plan to raise prices Another measure from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a data firm and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations It also seems to be dropping see chart 2 Two factors explain why the global economy has held up better than expected: energy prices and private-sector finances Last year the cost of fuel in the rich world rose by well over 20%and by 60% or more in parts of Europe Economists expected prices to remain high in 2023 crushing energy-intensive sectors such as heavy industry They were wrong Helped by unseasonably warm weather companies have proved unexpectedly flexible when it comes to dealing with high costs In November German industrial gas consumption was 27% lower than normal yet industrial production was only 05% down on the year before And over the Christmas period European natural-gas prices fell by half to levels last seen before Russia invaded Ukraine see chart 3 The strength of private-sector finances has also made a difference Our best guess is that families in the g7 are sitting on “excess” savingsie those above and beyond what you would expect them to have accumulated in normal timesof around $3trn or about 10% of annual consumer spending accumulated through a combination of pandemic stimulus and lower outlays in 2020-21 As a result although companies’ quarterly earnings in America suggest spending is faltering it is not falling off a cliff Consumers can weather higher prices and a higher cost of credit Businesses meanwhile are still sitting on large cash piles And few face large debt repayments right now: $600bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt will mature this year compared with $900bn due in 2025Can the data continue to beat expectations? There is evidence including in a recent paper by Goldman Sachs a bank that the heaviest drag from tighter monetary policy occurs after about nine months Financial conditions started really tightening nine months ago If the theory holds then the economy soon might be on surer footing even as higher rates eat away at inflation China is another reason for cheer Although removing domestic covid-19 restrictions slowed the economy in December as people hid from the virus scrapping “zero-covid” will ultimately raise global demand for goods and services The pessimistic case however remains strong Central banks have a long way to go before they can be certain that inflation is under control especially with China reopening pushing up commodity prices America forward-looking indicators are getting bleaker In addition an economy on the cusp of recession is unpredictable Once people start to lose jobs and cut spending predicting the depths of a downturn becomes hard And a crucial lesson from recent years is that if something can go wrong it often does But it is nice to have a glimmer of hope all the same For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

country officials are currently redesigning policy on a vast scale The government has abandoned its “zero-covid” approach to the pandemic while simultaneously signalling an end to a crackdown on technology firms Policymakers are also trying to rescue the property industry After two years of forcing developers to deleveragewhich has pushed dozens to default on debtsregulators are now

exact contents of the government reforms remain murky On January 13th officials produced a draft 21-point plan which stated that the aim was to provide liquidity to “good-quality” developers The task now is to differentiate between these companies and bad ones: no clear definition has been given of what constitutes good quality The plan will also push policy banks to grant loans for stalled projects and state-owned asset managers to provide credit for mergers and acquisitions Commercial banks which had pulled back from property have been told to start lending to reliable developers once

 Jan 19th 2023,Could Europe end up with a worse inflation problem than America?,Inflation is coming down On both sides of the Atlantic falling energy costs are provoking sighs of relief Price-watchers are now focused on core inflation a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices and is usually much slower to riseand more difficult to bring down Since October core inflation in the euro zone has been higher than in America Could Europeans end up with a worse inflation problem than their transatlantic peers?

multitaskOKEvery economist knows Milton Friedman dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” But the Nobel-prizewinner words do not seem to capture the current bout of inflation where post-pandemic supply disruptions fiscal splurges an energy shock and labour shortages have created a near-perfect storm causing prices to soar How fast inflation comes down may therefore depend not only on what central banks do but on how these factorsthe disruptions energy shock and wage risesaffect economies on either side of the AtlanticAlongside these surprises there has been extraordinary tumult in the basic operations of rich-world economies Covid-19 altered how people work what they consume and where they live and did so in short order Removing pandemic restrictions then led to a surge in demand for travel nights out and treats On top of this governments in America and Europe have decided to subsidise green technologies on an unprecedented scale Capital production inputs and workers need to move to parts of the economy that are growing and away from those that are shrinking Until they do the economy cannot produce enough to meet demandYet moving jobs or investing in new plants or software takes time A boom accelerates the process Recent work by Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and colleagues shows that workers in Germany are more likely to change jobs when demand is high than during recessions Another study using American data suggests that moving to a growing firm increases pay for the job-switching worker substantially The current shifts in the economy are therefore likely to produce some inflationand that may be desirable A recent paper by Veronica Guerrieri of the University of Chicago and colleagues argues that monetary policy should tolerate somewhat higher inflation if doing so allows workers to find a new job during periods of economic changeGovernment policies in America and Europe have affected the pace of adjustment to these changes Europe approach was generally to try to freeze things in place during the pandemic The continent governments created generous furlough schemes which kept workers in their existing jobs Unlike America there was no boom in durable-goods consumption financed by stimulus cheques that required expanded production Nor did Europe run its economy hot to aid a reallocation of workers and capital If inflation in America is the result of an economic reshuffle it may come down faster than Europe once that process is complete Europe also had to cope with a different economic hit Julian di Giovanni of the Federal Reserve and colleagues show that compared with America supply crunches accounted for a greater share of inflation in 2020-21 Wholesale gas and electricity prices began to rise in autumn 2021 and soared after Russia invaded Ukraine with oil and coal prices following This added much more to inflation in energy-importing Europe than it did in America The consensus in economics is that central banks should not tighten policy too much in response to a temporary supply or energy shock Coping with such a shock is hard enoughno need to give the screw another turn The effects should subside over time so long as inflation expectations stay stable Now that supply crunches in everything from lumber to chips are easing and energy prices are coming down Europe should benefit more than America That is if inflation has not become entrenched Inflation gets baked into economies when workers and firms come to believe that prices will keep rising In the worst-case scenario this creates a wage-price spiral with workers and firms unable to agree on a division of the economic pie In a tight flexible labour market like America which has little collective bargaining wage growth should quickly track inflation And that is what happened: wage growth accelerated when inflation began to rise As a new paper by Guido Lorenzoni of Northwestern University and Ivan Werning of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues this theoretically increases the risk of a wage-price spiral But America seems to have made it past the point of greatest danger According to Indeed a hiring website the country wage growth though high has been coming down for a while Blessed unionsIn Europe wages are often decided in collective-bargaining agreements Across the eu around six in ten workers are covered by such arrangements Deals typically last a year or more meaning that wages take time to adjust to economic conditions That was great when inflation got going Wage pressures did not immediately add to inflation Unions and firms could negotiate about how to divide the blow to incomes and profits After all the two sides meet at the same table every year to take stock and adjust Since they cover large chunks of the economy they have reason to take the macroeconomic effects of any deal into accountBut relations are feeling the strain With inflation in Europe stubbornly high unions are demanding extra compensation for their members Germany public-sector outfits are seeking a 105% increase in the latest round of bargaining Such delayed increases in pay are a normal feature of an economy where wages take time to adjust and which has been hit by a supply shock As Messrs Lorenzoni and Werning

 Jan 19th 2023,China re-globalisation paradox,At the annual World Economic Forum meeting this week in Davos Switzerland China economic tsar Liu He met a number of “old friends” he had not seen during his country long battle with covid-19 In a solicitous speech he acknowledged the importance of in-person meetings lamented the fragmentation of the world and called for economic “re-globalisation” In a philosophical aside he also emphasised the “duality” of things Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina recently abandoned “zero-covid” policy cut the country off from the rest of the world contributing to the fragmentation Mr Liu bemoaned But China period of isolation had a notable duality of its own Although the movement of people across China borders was sharply curtailed the movement of goods from China to the rest of the world was spectacular Despite all the disruptions China exports grew by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 and by another 7% in 2022 according to figures released on January 13th Perhaps in-person meetings are overratedChina episodic lockdowns proved less damaging to trade than feared at the time When Shanghai was brought to a standstill in April and May many worried it would clog international supply chains and push up global inflation But a lot of trade passed through nearby Ningbo instead An index of global supply-chain pressure created by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York peaked at the end of 2021 before China fraught battles with Omicron last year The index decline since then was interrupted by the Shanghai lockdown and Russia invasion of Ukraine but not for long see chart Prices tell a similar story In June when the headline inflation rate in the United States peaked at 91% the average price of Chinese imports into America rose by only 33% compared with a year earlier With the abrupt removal of China zero-covid policy the flow of people like Mr Liu across the mainland borders has resumed The number of passengers on Air China international routes rose by a third in December compared with the previous month Other parts of the economy will also improve as the year unfolds A recovery is expected in retail spending which fell last year and would have been even weaker had it not been for the anxious stockpiling of food and medicines The outlook should also improve for home sales which shrank by more than a quarter in 2022 the sharpest decline on record The government has given property developers a “blood transfusion” Mr Liu reported in Davos helping them raise finance It has also taken steps to quicken the pulse of the market which he hopes will help developers raise much-needed revenueBut the glaring exception to this brighter outlook is exports They are likely to fare worse in China year of reopening than in its last year of lockdowns Indeed the monthly figures have been negative in the past three releases According to ubs a bank merchandise exports will shrink by 4% in dollar terms in 2023 as a whole This would be only their fifth such fall since 1980 The re-globalisation of China people will coincide with a deglobalisation of its goods China will attract many more foreign visitors and fewer foreign salesIn one important respect China reopening has made life harder for its exporters The turnaround in China zero-covid policy has contributed to a revival of the yuan which has risen by 8% against the dollar since the start of November making Chinese exports less competitive Mr Liu invited his audience in Davos to visit China again But even before the global capitalists arrive global capital has rushed to reacquaint itself with Chinese assets bidding up the price of its currency Exporters have also converted more of their dollar earnings into yuan The main reason for the export bust though lies outside China The slowdown in the world economy will cut demand for its wares And the landing will not necessarily be soft In December for example China sales to America the eu and Japan fell by 17% compared with a year earlier Ting Lu of Nomura another bank worries that China will suffer from the so-called bullwhip effect A small dip in demand from consumers can lead to pronounced drops in orders for upstream suppliers just as a small flick of the wrist can lead to a vicious crack of the whip Even if the level of global spending proves resilient the mix is becoming less favourable to China In America and other rich countries consumption has shifted from the sorts of electronic goods that are prized by people working from home to the services people enjoy when they are able to move and mingle China global shipments of computers and their parts shrank by 35% in the latest trade figures When the threat of lockdowns dangled over global supply chains people worried that China exporters were a source of vulnerability for the world economy Instead the world economy is proving a source of vulnerability for China exporters For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 Jan 18th 2023,Venture capital $300bn question,Consider the following puzzle In 2021 venture capitalists raised $150bn in fresh cash a record amount Despite a market slowdown they broke the record once again in 2022 raising more than $160bn Chunks of this have already been spent but close to $300bn of “dry powder” sits waiting to be put to use Indeed spending fell throughout 2022 Fledgling firms appear cheap Why then are venture capitalists sitting on the cash?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs with many other puzzles in finance the answer starts with the rapid rise in global interest rates since the start of last year Higher rates have caused the value of stocks to plummet as investors have moved capital into safer assets such as cash and government bonds The tech-heavy nasdaq index has lost more than a fifth of its value over the past year In 2022 the amount of capital raised in stockmarket listings dropped to a 32-year low Public-market slowdowns such as the one currently in progress reduce expected returns for investors in private markets by lowering the valuation at which startups “exit” into public markets Venture capitalists therefore demand lower prices in order to invest in the first place This especially hurts funding for late-stage startups that in normal times might be close to a public listing Some firms flush with cash from fundraising in 2021 are choosing to wait things out reducing the pace of new deals The smaller number continuing with plans must hope to avoid a dreaded “down-round” in which a startup raises cash at a lower valuation than in a previous rounda let-down for employees and early investors who are forced to confront losses on their shares Meanwhile investors have become less willing to take a punt on riskier opportunities They can no longer count on another backer following them into a deal and helping make it a success either with expertise or raw cashThe second part of the answer is more subtle In theory venture capitalists could spend the money they have in hand It is after all already committed to their funds For some firms doing so would mean they would also avoid losing out on management fees which only apply to invested capital not that merely promised to their funds after a certain period of time But spending at a breakneck pace would almost certainly prove to be self-defeating in the long run Venture capitalists periodically raise money from limited partners such as endowments and pension funds Many of these now want to reduce their exposure to venture capital since public markets have taken a hit and they seek to keep allocations to different asset classes in rough proportion As a result a handful are calling up venture-capital funds to say things to the effect of “don’t rush back” for more money says an investor in several venture-capital funds Venture capitalists are listening Harry Nelis a partner at Accel a venture-capital firm speculates that cash which might have taken a year to spend during the market boom will now be made to last around three times as long And spending could get even slower The money raised by venture-capital funds does not actually sit in their bank accounts Instead funds must make “capital calls” to their limited partners when they want to finance an investment This forces the limited partner to free up cash from elsewhere in their portfolio which they are loth to do at a time of stress Funds are well aware that they will want to come back to their partners for more money in the future so seek to avoid irritating them by placing calls at awkward times Indeed in 2001 during a slowdown which followed the dotcom bubble some investors even “returned” committed funds to limited partners so that their partners could reallocate the money as they wishedVenture capitalists have other reasons to be concerned about relations with limited partners During the recent boom funds started to poke their noses far beyond their usual concerns Sequoia Capital a famous outfit in Silicon Valley launched a “superfund” which includes investments ranging from traditional venture-capital interests to public-market shares Some limited partners thought these sorts of funds were absurdly broad but opted to buy in anyway in order to gain access to specialist funds Little wonder that venture capitalists are now slamming on the brakes and seeking to repair relations with their limited partners At least as long as market conditions remain miserable the industry world-conquering ambition will remain on hold Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

 Jan 26th 2023,Have economists misunderstood inflation?,Imagine it is late 2024 Inflation in the rich world has fallen from its peak but stayed stubbornly high At around 4% it is well above the level at which most central banks are comfortable Governments weighed down by vast debts must use precious revenues to pay interest on the debt which itself is growing because of high interest rates The energy transition and rising state spending owing to ageing populations add to the fiscal largesse Raising taxes is politically fraught so more money is printed Inflation stays high and governments’ credibility worsens Central bankers are scratching their heads wondering how their powerful weaponthe interest ratehas failed so thoroughlyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA wonkish theory laid out in glorious detail in a new book by John Cochrane of Stanford University Hoover Institution would offer a potential explanation “The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level” builds a theory of inflation as ambitious as that proposed by John Maynard Keynes “The General Theory” or Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz “A Monetary History” Mr Cochrane whose own work on the subject spans four decades spends nearly 600 pages reworking the maths of past economic models to incorporate fiscal theory while chattily discussing how it explains past inflationary episodes “[E]ven Milton Friedman might change his mind with new facts and experience at hand” he speculatesAt the heart of Mr Cochrane theory is the idea that government debt can be valued like a firm equity based on the returns to its owner pockets The price level will adjustand therefore drive inflation or deflationto ensure that the real value of the debt equals the sum of a government future budget surpluses appropriately discounted Thus the true driver of inflation is government debt not monetary policy Under this theory money is valuable because it can be used to pay tax and generate surpluses The set-up is not all that different from the gold standard except it is tax rather than gold that backs money Mr Cochrane is careful to note that the adjustment of the price level is not instantaneous People can be poor judges of a government credibility when it comes to paying off debts Just like stocks prices are able to deviate from fundamentals Yet in the long run they adjust A government that hands out money without eventually running surpluses will not avoid inflation for ever History appears to offer support Brad DeLong of the University of California Berkeley uses fiscal theory in his recent book “Slouching towards Utopia” to explain inflation in post-first-world-war Europe In France hefty debt-interest payments led to an average of 20% annual inflation over seven years In Germany things were worse The public lost faith in the ability of the state to pay off its debts without inflation Soon hyperinflation kicked in Mr Cochrane also brings fiscal theory to bear on America inflation in the 1970s-80s In the mid-1970s price rises exceeded 12% The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates; inflation dropped to 5% by 1977 Yet Mr Cochrane points out that inflation shot up again to more than 14% by 1980 in part because America failed to get its fiscal house in order Fiscal and regulatory reforms that raised expectations of future surpluses along with another dose of monetary medicine were needed to vanquish inflationHow is fiscal theory faring today? For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 prices stayed stubbornly low despite a ballooning supply of money and interest rates sitting at or below zero in much of the rich world A “crude monetarism” predicted an inflationary surge which did not materialise Other revamped “New Keynesian” models also proved unhelpful When governments spent big during the covid-19 pandemic many economists reasoning from recent history were sanguine about the possibility of inflationMr Cochrane argues fiscal theory can explain both the period of low inflation and the return of rapidly rising prices after the pandemic Inflation was meagre in the 2010s despite soaring government debts because politicians promised to get their books in order and low interest rates meant consumers and bondholders were willing to wait Yet during the pandemic governments took a different approach They dropped enormous cheques into consumers’ pockets The Fed purchased government debt immediately after its issuance There was little talk of sustainability Mr Cochrane argues that the direct nature of these “helicopter drops” informed people their newly fat pockets would not be drained by future taxes Thus they were more willing to spendHeads I win tails you loseThis story is perhaps too convenient Indeed Mr Cochrane admits that fiscal theory flaw is it offers a way of explaining nearly any series of historical events in an unfalsifiable manner Yes other theories of inflation have problems But if it is so hard to prove fiscal theory wrong are they really in a fair fight? Mr Cochrane story of how inflation ended in the 1980s is complicated by the fact that America actually cut taxes suggesting politicians were not all that concerned by balanced budgets Although deregulation may have boosted growth many economists think the budget surpluses of the 1990s were mainly caused by globalisation and an it boom which few consumers in the 1980s saw comingFiscal theory also offers limited guidance to policymakers beyond what is already well-known Under its approach monetary policy remains important: interest rates can spread out an increase in the price level over a period of time In addition the theory suggests governments must maintain credibility when it comes to paying off their debtshardly a radical idea Fast-forward once again to late 2024 Imagine this time inflation has fallen to 2% Interest rates are slowly coming down Central bankers are running a victory lap What of fiscal theory?

 Jan 26th 2023,What inflation means for the Big Mac index,For much of the past two years economists have argued fiercely about prices As inflation in America and elsewhere has exceeded central-bank targets analysts have dissected different components of the cost of living including the prices of goods services energy and rents Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut what about the Big Mac? The iconic McDonald burger is an amalgam of rent electricity and labour as well as beef bread and cheese Its price is therefore indicative of broader inflationary pressures And because the burger is basically the same wherever you are in the world its price can also reveal how inflation has changed the relative costliness of different countriesIn America for example the median price of a Big Mac has risen by more than 6% to an average of $536 in the past two years The price tends to be a bit higher in big cities According to the theory of purchasing-power parity when a country prices rise its currency should fall everything else equal This stops the country prices moving too far out of line with those elsewhere in the world Yet the dollar has risen not fallen over the past two years against the currencies of most other big economies A trade-weighted exchange-rate index published by America Federal Reserve increased by more than 9% from December 2020 to December 2022 One reason for this is that inflation has also returned to lots of America trading partners Indeed in many places it is worse Big Mac prices have risen by 14% over the past two years in the euro area and by 15% in Britain But the dollar rise against the euro and pound has been more than required to offset this inflation gapThe combination of rising prices and a rising currency threatens to move American prices out of whack with those elsewhere in the world Two years ago for example the Big Mac was 26% cheaper in Japan than America In principle this suggests the yen was undervalued and should have risen against the dollar In fact the opposite occurred A Big Mac is now more than 40% cheaper in Japan There are exceptions where the theory of purchasing-power parity has held Although Argentina peso has fallen against the dollar prices in the country have risen even faster A Big Mac now costs the equivalent of $531 That is high compared with the price two years ago and also compared with today price in Brazil $444 If the two Latin American countries were to form a currency union at today exchange rate Argentina would find itself at a hefty competitive disadvantage It would be almost 20% more expensive than its larger neighbour at least judging by burger pricesThe Economist has been making comparisons of this kind since 1986 Converting Big Mac prices into dollars always reveals big differences in the cost of the same burger in different countries One measure of the “fair value” of a currency is the exchange rate that would eliminate these gaps But of course exchange rates are not the only thing that can adjust Prices can also rise faster in one country than another In the long era of low inflation this was not where the action was Over the past two years prices have been on the move in many countries Unfortunately these bouts of inflation have done little to move burger prices closer together For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 26th 2023,When professional stockpickers beat the algorithms,Last year plunging markets left few investors smiling Stocks and bonds fell in tandem; haven assets failed to offer safe harbour Doing well meant making single-figure percentage losses rather than double It might therefore seem an odd time for fund managers to be walking with a spring in their step Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut on January 23rd it emerged that Citadel a secretive investment firm based in Miami had generated $16bn in net profits for its clients in 2022 breaking the record for the largest annual gain in dollar terms Its main hedge fund posted a 38% returnwhile msci broadest index of global stocks declined by 18% Champagne corks were popping elsewhere too Strategas Securities a brokerage and research firm reckons that 62% of active fund managers investing in large American firms beat the s&p 500 index of such shares in 2022 the highest percentage since 2005 Last year therefore snapped a miserable losing streak for stockpickers Every year from 2010 to 2021 more than half of active managers who benchmarked their performance against the s&p 500 failed to beat it In other words the average fund manager was outclassed by a simple algorithm blindly buying every stock in the index Such algorithmsknown as “passive” or “index” fundsare taking over By 2021 they held 43% of the assets managed by American investment companies and owned a greater share of the country stockmarket than their actively managed counterpartsThe logic that drives passive funds is inescapable By definition the performance of an index is the average of those who own the underlying stocks Beating an index is a zero-sum game If one investor does another must lose out Active managers may spot a superstar stock that ends up leaving the rest in the dust But it will also be in the index so passive investors will buy it too Meanwhile active managers tend to charge fees that are orders of magnitude higher than passive ones: often 1-2% a year and more for whizzy hedge funds compared with as little as 003% for their algorithmic peers This drag on performance makes it all but inevitable that index funds will outpace human money managers in the long runSo how did fund managers outperform in 2022?

 Jan 26th 2023,Argentina and Brazil propose a bizarre common currency,Argentina is running out of vaults With annual inflation nearing 100% as the central bank prints bills to cover the government fiscal deficit local banks are making space for ballooning stocks of pesos Officials have tightened capital controls Imports are at a standstill The government is going through the motions with the imf to avoid its tenth sovereign default since independence in 1816 Yet on January 22nd Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva Brazil president and Alberto Fernández his Argentine counterpart announced they would start preparations for a common currency possibly leading to a full currency union which would hitch South America biggest economy to one of its sickestListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea has a history First came the “gaucho” a currency meant to replace Brazil cruzado and Argentina austral until the concept was abandoned amid economic turmoil in 1988 On its heels was a proposal by members of Mercosur a trade alliance to adopt a common currency and sucre an experiment led by Venezuela which had ambitions to reduce the continent reliance on the dollar Since it is prone to selling foreign reserves to prop up the peso Argentina is always short of dollars to settle loans and pay for imports A joint currency would create alternative reserves and make neighbourly trade easier Brazil is Argentina largest trading partner By supporting the idea Lula as Mr Silva is known gets a reputational boost from being seen to revive regional co-operation That at least is the case for the idea The case against is daunting A full union with a joint central bank would surely crumble Economists judge how well countries fit in a currency union using criteria devised by Robert Mundell a Canadian economist that measure economic similarities Normally central bankers tailor interest rates to individual economies; in a union one rate has to do for them all Policy rates in Argentina and Brazil are an astonishing 61 percentage points apart Their business cycles are wildly out of sync as their main exportsagriculture and industrial commodities respectivelyare affected by different global headwinds Argentina problems make its downturns deeper and booms shorter and shallower Another condition specified by Mundell is that people and money should move smoothly across borders acting as a means of adjustment when a shock hits one country but not the other Whereas in Europe farm workers hop between jobs and countries South America poor infrastructure makes travel a hassle and Argentina capital controls make getting paid across borders nearly impossible If workers do not end up where they are most productive artificially high wages could spark inflation in parts of the union Moreover as long as Brazil was committed to the joint currency it would be forced to bail out its southern neighbour Secure in that knowledge Argentina would have every reason to carry on spending irresponsibly Brazil is already getting cold feet Officials have stressed the new currency would be an addition to the two national ones rather than a replacement and that it is a long-term project Other countries are not racing to join Lula and Mr Fernández offered South American leaders the chance to do so at a press conference on January 25th: no one has so far taken them up This watered-down union would still place Argentina problems at Brazil door There would need to be a monetary policymaker either a currency board or full-blown central bank to watch exchange rates The imf to which Argentina owes $72bn would be less willing to prop up the peso if Argentina had another legal tender To top it all off Lula would have to ignore his independent central bank which has come out in opposition to the idea On January 23rd barely 24 hours after the grand announcement Fernando Haddad Brazil finance minister implied the idea would only get off the ground as notes of credit that were backed by Argentinian commodities That would not be currency at all But it would be more borrowing which is exactly what Argentina set out to avoid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 24th 2023,How the world economy could avoid recession,Last year markets had a terrible time So far 2023 looks different Many indices including the Euro Stoxx 600 Hong Kong Hang Seng and a broad measure of emerging-market share prices have seen their best start to the year in decades America s&p 500 is up by 5% Since reaching its peak in October the trade-weighted value of the dollar has fallen by 7% a sign that fear about the global economy is ebbing Even bitcoin has had a good year Not long ago it felt as though a global recession was nailed on Now optimism is re-emerging Listen to

lower gas prices bye-bye recession” cheered analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank on January 18th in a report on the euro zone Nomura a Japanese lender has revised its forecast of Britain recession “to something less pernicious [than] what we originally expected” Citigroup another bank said that “the probability of a full-blown global recession in which growth in many countries turns down in tandem is now roughly 30% [in contrast with] the 50% assessment that we maintained through the second half of last year” These are crumbs: the world economy is weaker than at any point since the lockdowns of 2020 But investors will eat anything Forecasters are in part responding to real-time economic data Despite talk of a global recession since at least last February when Russia invaded Ukraine these have held up better than expected Consider a weekly estimate of gdp from the oecd a group of mostly rich countries which account for about 60% of global output It is hardly booming but in mid-January few countries were struggling see chart 1 Widely watched “purchasing-manager index” measures of global output rose slightly in January consistent with gdp growth of about 2%Official numbers remain mixed Recent figures on American retail and industry came in below expectations In Japan machinery orders were far weaker than forecast Yet after reaching an all-time low in the summer consumer confidence across the oecd has risen Shortly after we went to press officials were due to publish their first estimate of America gdp in the fourth quarter of 2022 Most economists were expecting a decent number though pandemic disruptions mean these figures will be less reliable than normal Labour markets seem to be holding up too In some rich countries including Austria and Denmark joblessness is risinga telltale sign that a recession is looming Barely a day goes by without an announcement from another big technology company that it is letting people go Yet tech accounts for a small share of overall jobs and in most countries unemployment remains low Happily in places where demand for labour is dropping employers are withdrawing job adverts rather than sacking people We estimate that since reaching an all-time high of more than 30m early last year unfilled vacancies across the oecd have fallen by about 10% Meanwhile the number of people actually in a job has fallen by less than 1% from its peak Investors pay attention to labour markets but they really care about right now is inflation It is too soon to know if this threat has passed In the rich world “core” inflation a measure of underlying pressure is still 5-6% year on year far higher than central banks find comfortable The problem though is no longer getting worse In America core inflation is coming down as is the share of small firms which plan to raise prices Another measure from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a data firm and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations It also seems to be dropping see chart 2 Two factors explain why the global economy has held up better than expected: energy prices and private-sector finances Last year the cost of fuel in the rich world rose by well over 20%and by 60% or more in parts of Europe Economists expected prices to remain high in 2023 crushing energy-intensive sectors such as heavy industry They were wrong Helped by unseasonably warm weather companies have proved unexpectedly flexible when it comes to dealing with high costs In November German industrial gas consumption was 27% lower than normal yet industrial production was only 05% down on the year before And over the Christmas period European natural-gas prices fell by half to levels last seen before Russia invaded Ukraine see chart 3 The strength of private-sector finances has also made a difference Our best guess is that families in the g7 are sitting on “excess” savingsie those above and beyond what you would expect them to have accumulated in normal timesof around $3trn or about 10% of annual consumer spending accumulated through a combination of pandemic stimulus and lower outlays in 2020-21 As a result although companies’ quarterly earnings in America suggest spending is faltering it is not falling off a cliff Consumers can weather higher prices and a higher cost of credit Businesses meanwhile are still sitting on large cash piles And few face large debt repayments right now: $600bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt will mature this year compared with $900bn due in 2025Can the data continue to beat expectations? There is evidence including in a recent paper by Goldman Sachs a bank that the heaviest drag from tighter monetary policy occurs after about nine months Financial conditions started really tightening nine months ago If the theory holds then the economy soon might be on surer footing even as higher rates eat away at inflation China is another reason for cheer Although removing domestic covid-19 restrictions slowed the economy in December as people hid from the virus scrapping “zero-covid” will ultimately raise global demand for goods and services The pessimistic case however remains strong Central banks have a long way to go before they can be certain that inflation is under control especially with China reopening pushing up commodity prices America forward-looking indicators are getting bleaker In addition an economy on the cusp of recession is unpredictable Once people start to lose jobs and cut spending predicting the depths of a downturn becomes hard And a crucial lesson from recent years is that if something can go wrong it often does But it is nice to have a glimmer of hope all the same For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 23rd 2023,Can China fix its property crisis?,To judge by the high-rises dotted along the shore in Haiyang a small coastal city Country Garden prospects are pretty meagre The firm China biggest developer by sales has sold few beachside flats A handful of towers appear only partly built A faux-German village with pointed roofs accommodates shops and restaurants and adds a measure of flair But

have faced such difficulties The volume of floor space sold across the country fell by 24% in 2022 the biggest slump since data became available in 1992 Meanwhile property investment was down 10% year on year the first drop on record Cross-border defaults are also proving difficult Evergrande the world most indebted developer which collapsed in 2021 has still not produced a restructuring plan originally due in July The firm auditor PwC resigned on January 16th This reduction in activity has been catastrophic for China economy which derives around a fifth of its gdp from property The country officials are currently redesigning policy on a vast scale The government has abandoned its “zero-covid” approach to the pandemic while simultaneously signalling an end to a crackdown on technology firms Policymakers are also trying to rescue the property industry After two years of forcing developers to deleveragewhich has pushed dozens to default on debtsregulators are now abandoning many of these measures in the hope of reviving sentiment This has prompted a measure of optimism Despite the bleak view in Haiyang Country Garden share price has trebled since OctoberThe exact contents of the government reforms remain murky On January 13th officials produced a draft 21-point plan which stated that the aim was to provide liquidity to “good-quality” developers The task now is to differentiate between these companies and bad ones: no clear definition has been given of what constitutes good quality The plan will also push policy banks to grant loans for stalled projects and state-owned asset managers to provide credit for mergers and acquisitions Commercial banks which had pulled back from property have been told to start lending to reliable developers once again And state media report that the “three-red-lines” policy which capped debt will be relaxed for 30 unnamed firms Companies began rapidly raising new debt in Decembera sign that policy easing kicked off well before the government announced the new measures Local authorities have been lowering mortgage rates and many are now at record lows The state bail-out funds are targeting unfinished construction About 60% of homes sold between 2013 and 2020 are thought not to have been delivered to buyers many of whom have nevertheless started to make payments Without funding construction projects have stalled and cannot be finished Fear of unfinished homes has put off prospective buyersThe state also wants to avoid more messy defaults Country Garden made a last-minute payment to bondholders on January 17th This was enabled by support from local governments something few companies aside from those as big and important as Country Garden have at the moment According to Refinitiv a data firm some 950bn yuan $140bn in offshore dollar debts alone will mature this year up from 810bn yuan last year The plan is showing some early results Home completions fell by 6% year on year in December marking a recovery from the month before when they fell by 18% see chart This is a closely watched measure: unfinished homes prompted homebuyers to boycott their mortgage payments last year

first ten days of the year compared with the same period a month earlierKaisa a developer that defaulted in 2021 has been avoiding restructuring talks with foreign investors and looks to be far from an agreement with creditors Yet despite its troubles demand for the company homes appears to be growing Analysts from CreditSights a research firm recently visited a project in Shanghai and found agents were no longer offering discounts on flats The absence of price cuts suggests demand is beginning to pick up for properties in good locationsA few foreign investors have been encouraged by the state plan Firms have almost entirely been shut out from the offshore bond market where many global asset managers and hedge funds are trying to recoup losses following missed payments The funds raised by developers fell by a quarter last year compared with the year before But on January 12th Dalian Wanda Commercial Management priced a $400m junk bond the first in more than a year and a sign

 Jan 19th 2023,Could Europe end up with a worse inflation problem than America?,Inflation is coming down On both sides of the Atlantic falling energy costs are provoking sighs of relief Price-watchers are now focused on core inflation a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices and is usually much slower to riseand more difficult to bring down Since October core inflation in the euro zone has been higher than in America Could Europeans end up with a worse inflation problem than their transatlantic peers? Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvery economist knows Milton Friedman dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” But the Nobel-prizewinner words do not seem to capture the current bout of inflation where post-pandemic supply disruptions fiscal splurges an energy shock and labour shortages have created a near-perfect storm causing prices to soar How fast inflation comes down may therefore depend not only on what central banks do but on how these factorsthe disruptions energy shock and wage risesaffect economies on either side of the AtlanticAlongside these surprises there has been extraordinary tumult in the basic operations of rich-world economies Covid-19 altered how people work what they consume and where they live and did so in short order Removing pandemic restrictions then led to a surge in demand for travel nights out and treats On top of this governments in America and Europe have decided to subsidise green technologies on an unprecedented scale Capital production inputs and workers need to move to parts of the economy that are growing and away from those that are shrinking Until they do the economy cannot produce enough to meet demandYet moving jobs or investing in new plants or software takes time A boom accelerates the process Recent work by Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and colleagues shows that workers in Germany are more likely to change jobs when demand is high than during recessions Another study using American data suggests that moving to a growing firm increases pay for the job-switching worker substantially The current shifts in the economy are therefore likely to produce some inflationand that may be desirable A recent paper by Veronica Guerrieri of the University of Chicago and colleagues argues that monetary policy should tolerate somewhat higher inflation if doing so allows workers to find a new job during periods of economic changeGovernment policies in America and Europe have affected the pace of adjustment to these changes Europe approach was generally to try to freeze things in place during the pandemic The continent governments created generous furlough schemes which kept workers in their existing jobs Unlike America there was no boom in durable-goods consumption financed by stimulus cheques that required expanded production Nor did Europe run its economy hot to aid a reallocation of workers and capital If inflation in America is the result of an economic reshuffle it may come down faster than Europe once that process is complete Europe also had to cope with a different economic hit Julian di Giovanni of the Federal Reserve and colleagues show that compared with America supply crunches accounted for a greater share of inflation in 2020-21 Wholesale gas and electricity prices began to rise in autumn 2021 and soared after Russia invaded Ukraine with oil and coal prices following This added much more to inflation in energy-importing Europe than it did in America The consensus in economics is that central banks should not tighten policy too much in response to a temporary supply or energy shock Coping with such a shock is hard enoughno need to give the screw another turn The effects should subside over time so long as inflation expectations stay stable Now that supply crunches in everything from lumber to chips are easing and energy prices are coming down Europe should benefit more than America That is if inflation has not become entrenched Inflation gets baked into economies when workers and firms come to believe that prices will keep rising In the worst-case scenario this creates a wage-price spiral with workers and firms unable to agree on a division of the economic pie In a tight flexible labour market like America which has little collective bargaining wage growth should quickly track inflation And that is what happened: wage growth accelerated when inflation began to rise As a new paper by Guido Lorenzoni of Northwestern University and Ivan Werning of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues this theoretically increases the risk of a wage-price spiral But America seems to have made it past the point of greatest danger According to Indeed a hiring website the country wage growth though high has been coming down for a while Blessed unionsIn Europe wages are often decided in collective-bargaining agreements Across the eu around six in ten workers are covered by such arrangements Deals typically last a year or more meaning that wages take time to adjust to economic conditions That was great when inflation got going Wage pressures did not immediately add to inflation Unions and firms could negotiate about how to divide the blow to incomes and profits After all the two sides meet at the same table every year to take stock and adjust Since they cover large chunks of the economy they have reason to take the macroeconomic effects of any deal into accountBut relations are feeling the strain With inflation in Europe stubbornly high unions are demanding extra compensation for their members Germany public-sector outfits are seeking a 105% increase in the latest round of bargaining Such delayed increases in pay are a normal feature of an economy where wages take time to adjust and which has been hit by a supply shock As Messrs Lorenzoni and Werning demonstrate real wages typically take a hit before recovering to their old level But whereas America appears to be making progress the old continent remains some way behind Europe inflation race has

 Jan 19th 2023,China re-globalisation paradox,At the annual World Economic Forum meeting this week in Davos Switzerland China economic tsar Liu He met a number of “old friends” he had not seen during his country long battle with covid-19 In a solicitous speech he acknowledged the importance of in-person meetings lamented the fragmentation of the world and called for economic “re-globalisation” In a philosophical aside he also emphasised the “duality” of things Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina recently abandoned “zero-covid” policy cut the country off from the rest of the world contributing to the fragmentation Mr Liu bemoaned But China period of isolation had a notable duality of its own Although the movement of people across China borders was sharply curtailed the movement of goods from China to the rest of the world was spectacular Despite all the disruptions China exports grew by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 and by another 7% in 2022 according to figures released on January 13th Perhaps in-person meetings are overratedChina episodic lockdowns proved less damaging to trade than feared at the time When Shanghai was brought to a standstill in April and May many worried it would clog international supply chains and push up global inflation But a lot of trade passed through nearby Ningbo instead An index of global supply-chain pressure created by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York peaked at the end of 2021 before China fraught battles with Omicron last year The index decline since then was interrupted by the Shanghai lockdown and Russia invasion of Ukraine but not for long see chart Prices tell a similar story In June when the headline inflation rate in the United States peaked at 91% the average price of Chinese imports into America rose by only 33% compared with a year earlier With the abrupt removal of China zero-covid policy the flow of people like Mr Liu across the mainland borders has resumed The number of passengers on Air China international routes rose by a third in December compared with the previous month Other parts of the economy will also improve as the year unfolds A recovery is expected in retail spending which fell last year and would have been even weaker had it not been for the anxious stockpiling of food and medicines The outlook should also improve for home sales which shrank by more than a quarter in 2022 the sharpest decline on record The government has given property developers a “blood transfusion” Mr Liu reported in Davos helping them raise finance It has also taken steps to quicken the pulse of the market which he hopes will help developers raise much-needed revenueBut the glaring exception to this brighter outlook is exports They are likely to fare worse in China year of reopening than in its last year of lockdowns Indeed the monthly figures have been negative in the past three releases According to ubs a bank merchandise exports will shrink by 4% in dollar terms in 2023 as a whole This would be only their fifth such fall since 1980 The re-globalisation of China people will coincide with a deglobalisation of its goods China will attract many more foreign visitors and fewer foreign salesIn one important respect China reopening has made life harder for its exporters The turnaround in China zero-covid policy has contributed to a revival of the yuan which has risen by 8% against the dollar since the start of November making Chinese exports less competitive Mr Liu invited his audience in Davos to visit China again But even before the global capitalists arrive global capital has rushed to reacquaint itself with Chinese assets bidding up the price of its currency Exporters have also converted more of their dollar earnings into yuan The main reason for the export bust though lies outside China The slowdown in the world economy will cut demand for its wares And the landing will not necessarily be soft In December for example China sales to America the eu and Japan fell by 17% compared with a year earlier Ting Lu of Nomura another bank worries that China will suffer from the so-called bullwhip effect A small dip in demand from consumers can lead to pronounced drops in orders for upstream suppliers just as a small flick of the wrist can lead to a vicious crack of the whip Even if the level of global spending proves resilient the mix is becoming less favourable to China In America and other rich countries consumption has shifted from the sorts of electronic goods that are prized by people working from home to the services people enjoy when they are able to move and mingle China global shipments of computers and their parts shrank by 35% in the latest trade figures When the threat of lockdowns dangled over global supply chains people worried that China exporters

 Jan 18th 2023,Venture capital $300bn question,Consider the following puzzle In 2021 venture capitalists raised $150bn in fresh cash a record amount Despite a market slowdown they broke the record once again in 2022 raising more than $160bn Chunks of this have already been spent but close to $300bn of “dry powder” sits waiting to be put to use Indeed spending fell throughout 2022 Fledgling firms appear cheap Why then are venture capitalists sitting on the cash?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs with many other puzzles in finance the answer starts with the rapid rise in global interest rates since the start of last year Higher rates have caused the value of stocks to plummet as investors have moved capital into safer assets such as cash and government bonds The tech-heavy nasdaq index has lost more than a fifth of its value over the past year In 2022 the amount of capital raised in stockmarket listings dropped to a 32-year low Public-market slowdowns such as the one currently in progress reduce expected returns for investors in private markets by lowering the valuation at which startups “exit” into public markets Venture capitalists therefore demand lower prices in order to invest in the first place This especially hurts funding for late-stage startups that in normal times might be close to a public listing Some firms flush with cash from fundraising in 2021 are choosing to wait things out reducing the pace of new deals The smaller number continuing with plans must hope to avoid a dreaded “down-round” in which a startup raises cash at a lower valuation than in a previous rounda let-down for employees and early investors who are forced to confront losses on their shares Meanwhile investors have become less willing to take a punt on riskier opportunities They can no longer count on another backer following them into a deal and helping make it a success either with expertise or raw cashThe second part of the answer is more subtle In theory venture capitalists could spend the money they have in hand It is after all already committed to their funds For some firms doing so would mean they would also avoid losing out on management fees which only apply to invested capital not that merely promised to their funds after a certain period of time But spending at a breakneck pace would almost certainly prove to be self-defeating in the long run Venture capitalists periodically raise money from limited partners such as endowments and pension funds Many of these now want to reduce their exposure to venture capital since public markets have taken a hit and they seek to keep allocations to different asset classes in rough proportion As a result a handful are calling up venture-capital funds to say things to the effect of “don’t rush back” for more money says an investor in several venture-capital funds Venture capitalists are listening Harry Nelis a partner at Accel a venture-capital firm speculates that cash which might have taken a year to spend during the market boom will now be made to last around three times as long And spending could get even slower The money raised by venture-capital funds does not actually sit in their bank accounts Instead funds must make “capital calls” to their limited partners when they want to finance an investment This forces the limited partner to free up cash from elsewhere in their portfolio which they are loth to do at a time of stress Funds are well aware that they will want to come back to their partners for more money in the future so seek to avoid irritating them by placing calls at awkward times Indeed in 2001 during a slowdown which followed the dotcom bubble some investors even “returned” committed funds to limited partners so that their partners could reallocate the money as they wishedVenture capitalists have other reasons to be concerned about relations with limited partners During the recent boom funds started to poke their noses far beyond their usual concerns Sequoia Capital a famous outfit in Silicon Valley launched a “superfund” which includes investments ranging from traditional venture-capital interests to public-market shares Some limited partners thought these sorts of funds were absurdly broad but opted to buy in anyway in order to gain access to specialist funds Little wonder that venture capitalists are now slamming on the brakes and seeking to repair relations with their limited partners At least as long as market conditions remain miserable the industry world-conquering ambition will remain on hold Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

 Jan 18th 2023,Japan extraordinarily expensive defence of its monetary policy,In december the Bank of Japan boj gave speculators an opening By lifting its cap on ten-year government bond yields from 025% to 05% the central bank raised the prospect that it would abandon its “yield-curve-control” policy entirely Since then officials have been put to the test by increasingly unco-operative bond markets The boj has been forced to make enormous bond purchases in an attempt to drive down the yield buying ¥95trn $72bn on January 12th and 13th aloneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSpeculators excitedly awaited the boj next meeting Would it be the moment the central bank gave up the fight? On January 18th the boj announced it would in fact keep going The bank even promised to buy more bonds if necessary The yen slumped on the news; short-sellers licked their wounds Yet defending the policy is becoming astonishingly costly The boj difficult decisions are not going awayYield-curve control was introduced by the bank in 2016 as part of an aggressive programme of monetary easing which officials hoped would lift Japan dormant inflation and economic growth The boj is one of the few central banks to have stuck to its guns in 2022neither raising interest rates nor halting big asset purchasesas inflation has risen around the world Japanese inflation has increased too but only to 38% year-on-year in December This is less than half the peaks in America and the euro zone And much of the surge is the result of high energy prices and the weak yen which hit a 32-year low against the dollar in October Thus the boj argues underlying inflation is yet to rise to its target level of 2% in a sustainable mannerThe central bank decision to lift the cap on bond yields in December was an attempt to improve liquidity and facilitate more trading It seems to have backfired The boj owns around half of the country bond market and more than 95% of some bond issuances after a decade of hefty purchases Extra purchases to defend the cap have worsened market shortagesThe boj decision to hold fast could exacerbate the situation The central bank is building vast potential losses on its bond portfolio If Japanese bond yields were to rise by just 025 percentage points the bank total holdings as of January 10th would slump in value by around ¥75trn or 14% of gdp according to our calculations Every extra bond bought to maintain the yield cap increases the potential loss Higher yields also alter Japan fiscal arithmetic Government net debt ran to about 173% of gdp in the third quarter of last year the highest of any rich country Some 8% of the national budget is spent on interest payments If payments on the stock of government debt rose by the same amount025 percentage pointsthe total bill would run to ¥11trn or 10% of this year government budget In the year ahead the boj has no good options For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 17th 2023,Investment banks are struggling in a high-interest-rate world,Shareholders like profits: a steady stream of income they can count on quarter after quarter The earnings America biggest banks make however are often pushed around by the volatility of the economy they serve If the economy accelerates demand for loans takes off; if it slows bankers must set aside provisions for bad loans Investment banks’ trading businesses tend to do well in times of volatility and uncertainty but their advisory services sell best when markets are healthy and stable Bank bosses must try to balance their exposure to these forcesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe past three years during which the American economy has experienced a pandemic-induced shutdown a financial boom and a rate shock have been unusually volatile As a result the period has been an interesting test of just how successful bank bosses have been in their efforts to balance the performance of their businesses The results were on show between January 13th and 17th as Bank of America Citigroup Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo took it in turns to report fourth quarter and full-year earningsAltogether profits at the six banks fell by 20% from $34bn in the fourth quarter of 2021 to around $27bn in the same period of 2022but the pain was not evenly spread Earnings at JPMorgan and Bank of America were up a little Meanwhile at Goldman Sachs they were down by two-thirds Some of this gap can be explained by their different strengths Firms with big consumer banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan typically do well when interest rates jump Rising rates tend to increase the difference between what banks pay out on deposits and earn on loans Net interest income as this gap is called zoomed higher in 2022 It climbed by $17bn between the end of 2021 and 2022 across the big six banks reaching $66bn This increase is partly offset by the fact that higher interest rates will make it harder for consumers and companies to pay back debts Banks also set aside some $72bn for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2022 Jamie Dimon boss of JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan boss of Bank of America have both predicted a mild recession in America this year Yet for the moment the net effect of higher interest rates on profits remains positive Investment-bank revenues which fall when stockmarkets do badly dropped by around 50% at Goldman and Morgan Stanley But the divergence in profits between the six banks cannot simply be explained by the differing performance of investment and consumer banks For one thing profits at Morgan Stanley where non-investment-bank businesses did well dropped far less sharply than at Goldman For another Wells Fargo offered up another bleak quarter despite its big consumer bank with profits half their level a year ago The pain at Wells can be explained by regulatory troubles In December the bank agreed to pay an enormous fine of $17bn to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for improperly managing millions of consumer accounts It is harder to explain the situation at Goldman The firm sought to build a consumer bank in part to diversify its business But it has had to set aside unusually high provisions for loan losses in that department and is now scaling back its efforts “What went wrong?” asked one analyst on the Goldman earnings call on January 17th David Solomon the bank boss argued the firm had tried to do too much too fast and had lacked the talent to pull off some of its wide-ranging ambitions Six days earlier the company had sacked 65% of its workforce The enormous economic shocks in recent years have revealed just how different the six banks have become In some cases the shocks have also revealed just how poorly they have been managed For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 15th 2023,Why health-care services are in chaos everywhere,The imposition of lockdowns during the covid-19 pandemic had one overarching aim: to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed Governments hoped to space out infections buying time to build capacity In the end however much of this extra capacity went unused England seven “Nightingale” hospitals closed having received only a few patients as did many of America field hospitals A study of Europe experience in Health Policy a journal found only one example where there were more covid patients than intensive-care beds: in the Italian region of Lombardy on April 3rd 2020 Although there are now stories of overwhelmed Chinese hospitals as the country confronts a great exit wave it is too soon to know whether these are isolated examples or represent broader systematic failureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOutside China covid weighs less heavily on people minds these days Yet health-care systems in much of the rich world are closer to collapse than at any point since the disease started to spread Unlike for unemployment or gdp there are few comparable up-to-date figures on health-care performance across countries So The Economist has trawled statistics produced by countries regions and even individual hospitals to paint a picture of what is going on The results suggest patients doctors and nurses are experiencing the brutal after-effects of the pandemicStart with Britain which produces high-quality data The National Health Service nhs the country state-run provider is in dire straits Just before the pandemic struck someone with a medical issue requiring urgent but not immediate attention a category that includes those suffering strokes and heart attacks waited on average 20 minutes for an ambulance Now they wait longer than an hour and a half see chart The number of lengthy “trolley waits”the time between a decision to admit a patient and arriving at a hospital wardhas jumped Other countries have less comprehensive statistics but equally miserable populations In September Ipsos a pollster released a global survey that included a question on the quality of local health care In almost all of the 20-odd rich countries surveyed people were less likely than in 2021 to say that the service on offer to them was “good” or “very good” In Britain the share saying so fell by five percentage points In Canada it fell by ten in Italy by 12Italian hospitals inundated by covid patients in early 2020 are struggling once again We analysed data from the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo site of some of the harrowing images of people on ventilators nearly three years ago In the year covid hit Italy the hospital waiting lists rose slightly on some measures They then fell slightly the next year But in 2022 they jumped Someone in the city looking for a non-urgent breast ultrasound may have to wait as long as two years Officials in Emilia-Romagna another region hit hard in 2020 have launched a plan to return waiting lists to pre-pandemic levelsNewspapers across the Anglosphere are filled with horror stories In New South Wales Australia a quarter of patients had to wait more than half an hour to be transferred from paramedics to emergency-room staff in the third quarter of 2022 up from a tenth two years before In Canada waiting times have reached an all-time high with a median delay of half a year between referral and treatment Even the richest most competent systems are feeling the strain In Switzerland there are fewer free intensive-care beds than at most points in the pandemic Germany is seeing similar problems with a surge in patients reducing intensive-care capacity see chart In Singapore patients waited for about nine hours to be seen in the average polyclinic at the end of 2021 By October 2022 they were waiting for 13America is doing better than most countries thanks to the vast amount of money it spends on health care and the excess capacity this funds But it is not doing well Average hospital-occupancy rates recently exceeded 80% for the first time Even in the darkest days of the pandemic few states reported paediatric wards under stress which we define as 90% or more beds being occupied In early November fully 17 states were in this position the result of a rise in all sorts of bugs in kids Every kind of sickness and disasterThe collapse in the quality of health care is contributing to an astonishing rise in “excess deaths”those above what would be expected in a normal year In many rich-world countries 2022 proved deadlier even than 2021 a year of several big waves of covid Monthly deaths across Europe are currently about 10% higher than expected Germany is in the middle of a vast mortality wave: weekly deaths have been more than 10% above normal since September In early December they were 23% higher What is going on? Politicians at both a national and regional level are taking the blameand occasionally deserve it But the forces creating the chaos are common across countries and are linked to a shared experience of the pandemic They may also in the short term at least be almost impossible for governments to overcome In the oecd club of mostly rich countries health expenditure is now not far short of 10% of gdp having been below 9% before the pandemic see chart Of the 20 countries for which there are data for 2021 18 spent more per person than ever before Almost all spent more as a share of gdp than in 2019 Even adjusting the figures for ageing populations does not meaningfully change these findings Thus the immediate problems facing health-care systems are not caused by a lack of cash Much of the increased spending has gone on programmes to combat covid including testing and tracing and vaccines But funding is now rising across systems more broadly In almost every rich country more people are working in health care than ever before Total employment in hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than in the year before the pandemic in the six oecd countries we surveyed The latest data suggest that in Canada 16m people now work in health care the most ever In the eu more than 12m people work in “human-health activities” a record American hospitals employ 53m people another record Perhaps the real problem is not staff numbers but how efficiently they are working Real output in America hospital and ambulatory-health-care sector which in effect measures the quantity of care provided is only 39% above its pre-pandemic level whereas output across the economy as a whole is 64% higher In England elective-care activity ie surgery planned in advance is slightly lower than it was before the pandemic struck In Western Australia the share of delayed elective surgeries jumped from 11% to 24% in the two years to November Put simply hospitals are doing less with more Although falling productivity growth is an economywide phenomenon health care currently suffers from additional pressures A recent paper by Diane Coyle of Cambridge University and colleagues looking at Britain considers the effects of dealing with covid “Donning and doffing” protocols to replace protective kit and cleaning requirements after dealing with covid patients both of which are still in force in many countries today slow everything down The segregation of covid from non-covid patients limits bed allocation Meanwhile staff feel wretched after three gruelling years A report in Mayo Clinic Proceedings a journal finds that quantitative measures of “burnout” among American physicians have shot up see chart If health-care workers are exhausted they may do fewer of the things that kept the show on the road such as staying late to make sure the patients’ register is in order or helping with the treatment of another medic patient Many among you are weakProductivity has fallenbut it has not plummeted in the manner that would be needed to explain the chaos This suggests the true explanation for the breakdown lies elsewhere: in exploding demand Coming out of lockdowns people seem to require more help than ever before Some of this is to do with immunity People went two years without being exposed to bugs Since then endemic pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus have bloomed Everyone you know has the flu But the pandemic also bottled up other conditions which are only now being diagnosed In 2020-21 many people delayed seeking treatment for fear of catching covid or because their local hospital was shut to non-covid conditions In Italy cancer diagnoses fell by about 40% in 2020 compared with 2018-19 A study of American patients noted a particular reduction in diagnoses was recorded over a similar period in cancers normally found during a screening or routine examination In England the nhs waiting list has grown by more than 60% since the pandemic was declared Many of the people on the list and on similar ones in other countries are likely to be sicker and thus to take up more resources than if they had received care in 2020 A recent paper published in Lancet Public Health another journal estimates that over the next two decades deaths from colorectal cancer could be nearly 10% higher in Australia than pre-pandemic trends suggested in part because of delays in treatmentCovid continues to add to demand as well The Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank estimates that the disease is cutting the number of available beds in the nhs by 2-7% As covid-positive patients draw resources providers offer everyone worse care Research by Thiemo Fetzer of Warwick University and Christopher Rauh of Cambridge University suggests that for every 30 or so extra covid deaths one non-covid patient dies “caused by the disruption to the quality of care” The effects of malfunctioning health-care systems go beyond unnecessary deaths People come to feel that their country is falling apart If you live in a rich country and fall ill you expect someone to help And someone is definitely supposed to help when the tax burden is at or close to an all-time high as it is in many places In time the backlog created by the pandemic will disappear The surge in respiratory viruses in adults and children has probably peaked Administrators have made progress in tackling enormous waiting lists But with an ageing population and covid now an ever-present threat pre-pandemic health care may come to seem like it was from a lost golden age For more

 Jan 12th 2023,Has economics run out of big new ideas?,At the annual meeting of the American Economic Association held this year in New Orleans wonks discussed everything from inflation and technological progress to the economics of crime and the energy transition Yet those looking for big breakthroughs would have left unsatisfied Most new work focused on rigorous analysis of data or painstaking theoretical modelling As one attendee noted such modelling often fails to produce surprising results since it tends to reflect the assumptions that go into itListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvidence for this downsizing of ambition is not purely anecdotal A recent paper in Nature analyses citation data from 1945 to 2010 to assess the disruptiveness of papers and patents The authors consider new work to be disruptive if later work that cites it is less likely to also mention its predecessors The paper concludes that the share of disruptive research in the social sciences has fallen precipitously even more so than in the actual sciences As Tyler Cowen of George Mason University puts it: “In the last 30 years the reliability of empirical work and estimations has risen dramatically Which is good But few new important ideas have really been generated”In New Orleans economics biggest names offered ideas that were fresh and interesting but hardly breakthroughs on the scale of say the Nash equilibrium or the idea of asymmetric information Gita Gopinath the imf chief economist discussed research on how the economics of international finance has shifted since the seminal work of Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming in the 1960s In a seminar on economic growth Thomas Philippon of New York University argued that growth follows linear trends rather than being an exponential process Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology presented work on “distorted innovation” arguing against the idea that markets tend to get innovation rightNew theories without robust empirical support can be dangerous as demonstrated by the rise of central planning during the 20th century And big advances are easier to spot in hindsight It may even turn out that there were some hidden among the presentations in New Orleans Some conference attendees were also more optimistic about the present state of affairs A professor noted that good questions in economics tend to come from real-world eventsand the past few years have been tumultuous enough to raise plenty of good questions Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University observes that the use of large datasets machine learning and field experiments are all “game-changers” Innovation may therefore simply be shifting from theory to practice Indeed the use of high-frequency data a feature of a presentation by Lisa Cook of the Federal Reserve has given economists and central bankers a helpful new way to look at the world in their fight against inflation Yet the most compelling evidence on the impact of monetary policy on inflation came from Christina Romer of the University of California Berkeley who dusted off an old-fashioned method In her talk she argued that monetary-policy changes have bigger effects on unemployment than inflation and that it sometimes takes a few years for their main impact to be felt The method used by Ms Romer and her husband and co-author David Romer was not a new statistical technique or even timelier data but a “narrative approach” The Romers combed through transcripts and minutes from meetings held by the Federal Open Market Committeejust as they had when they developed the method in a paper published in 1989 For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 11th 2023,Warnings from history for a new era of industrial policy,“Free trade is almost dead” declared Morris Chang the founder of tsmc dampening the mood at an event in December to celebrate a milestone in the building of the Taiwanese chipmaker new fab in Arizona The remark was not out of character In July he called America effort to bring chipmaking home an “exercise in futility” Until recently rich-world governments mostly shared his judgment But worries about supply-chain security in a fraught world are prompting experimentation History provides some reasons for optimismas well as many for concern Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIndustrial policy is just about as old as industry itself Scarcely had Britain Industrial Revolution got going when Alexander Hamilton America first Treasury secretary argued for protection of his country industry declaring that Adam Smith arguments in favour of free trade “though ‘geometrically true’ are ‘practically false’” America France and Germany industrialised behind tariff barriers After the second world war scores of governments tried to help industrialisation along with seeming success in places like Japan and South Korea and rather different results elsewhere Policy today is of a different sort: pursued by countries already at the technological frontier in a world of complex global supply chains Yet past research still holds valuable lessonsRecent interventions are mostly based on “infant-industry” arguments The idea is that if the state corrects a market failure a particular industry might thrive on its own in an economy where it is nascent or absent Local firms might need investment in know-how or equipment to be competitive which imperfect capital markets cannot finance Alternatively production might require a network of suppliers and manufacturers but firms struggle to co-ordinate Or there may be information problems An economy might have undiscovered potential but an entrepreneur who seeks it out risks revealing it to competitors which costs him the opportunity to profit from his discovery In each case government support or a brief spell of protection from foreign competition or both might create the space the industry needs to mature Working out if these theories are practically or merely geometrically true is no simple task Industrial policy is never conducted in isolation meaning it is often challenging to isolate its effects Still careful work suggests that infant-industry policy can work in the real world In the 1970s for instance America was the dominant exporter of computer chips The Japanese government invested heavily in semiconductor research and may have helped chip-consuming Japanese firms co-ordinate to obtain most of their supply from fledgling Japanese producers in effect shutting American firms out of the market Work by Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva and Paul Krugman of the City University of New York concluded that these policies supported the accumulation of expertise without which Japanese firms could never have succeeded in export markets More recent work by Myrto Kalouptsidi of Harvard University revealed that Chinese shipyard subsidies between 2006 and 2012 reduced costs by as much as 20% These subsidies she reckons helped account for a major reallocation of shipbuilding with Japan the big loser Other research turns up more cases when interventions have helped industries secure a market foothold and meaningfully influenced the global distribution of production At least sometimes comparative advantage can be engineeredYet an abundance of caution is in order Interventions often raise costs and thus hurt consumers Messrs Baldwin and Krugman judged the Japanese were made worse off on net by the effort to build a chip-exporting industry Because the output of one industry is often the input for another help for upstream producers can inflict pain further along the supply chain Reviewing efforts to boost steel industries across 21 countries Bruce Blonigen of the University of Oregon found such interventions sharply cut the export competitiveness of downstream industriesGovernments for their part must be willing to cut off help so that winners eventually swim while losers sink Otherwise zombie firms will tie up capital and labour and drag down growth Local conditions matter A study of eu investment funds provided to poorer regions by Sascha Becker of the University of Warwick and Peter Egger and Maximilian von Ehrlich of eth Zurich found that the cash translated into faster growth in investment and incomebut only in places with strong institutions and educated workers And as the world is rediscovering careless policy can provoke retaliation leaving everyone worse off This may prove to be a particular problem at a time when sophisticated goods are produced along cross-border supply chains If friendly countries fail to co-ordinate they may end up funding duplicative plants which cannot all be economical or orphan industries without access to the foreign components they need to competeHard problemsPolicies which fill institutional gaps are safer Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College notes that America tariffs in the 19th century do not seem to have been decisive in promoting its rise to industrial dominance Banking laws that facilitated saving and investment were more important In their survey Ann Harrison and Andrés Rodríguez-Clare of the University of California Berkeley doubt that “hard” interventions which distort market prices are of use but find an important role for “soft” collaborations between firms and the state to solve co-ordination failures This does not mean that the “harder” parts of America policy mix will doom its reshoring enterprise Mr Chang for his part insisted in December that he gave his remarks “in the full expectation that we are going to have success” Indeed the most pressing concern may be less that America gambit will fail than that it will succeed in boosting domestic industryand leave a fractured world worse off for it Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The Federal Reserve great anti-hero deserves a second look

 Jan 10th 2023,The hunt for FTX missing riches,On January 5th Sam Bankman-Fried turned up at the funeral of his own crypto empire He lodged a complaint against ftx bankruptcy proceedings demanding $500m in frozen assets earmarked for creditors Mr Bankman-Fried wants the money in order to pay legal fees for his criminal trial in which he is accused of sucking billions of dollars of customer deposits from the crypto exchange for his own use he has pleaded not guilty Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe demand is an opening salvo in what will be a long chaotic battle America bankruptcy laws have evolved over centuries to pick apart regular businesses Now on the fly lawyers must work out how to apply them to crypto companies In November ftx filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 which allows a bankrupt firm to reorganise rather than liquidate The process usually plays out as a legally refereed tussle between a company and its creditors The firm told by a court what it owes tries to convince lenders to accept stakes in the business rather than cash If successful it emerges with less borrowing and a shiny new growth plan If unsuccessful it shuts up shop A big restructuring might have 100 creditors A long one lasts a year A complex one takes at least a couple In a hearing on January 11th it emerged that ftx may have as many as 9m creditorsmaking it by this measure the ugliest corporate carcass ever seen The firm breakdown has left 134 insolvent entities in 27 jurisdictions They range from ftx Zuma a Nigerian exchange to Good Luck Games a game developer The proceedings could take a decade and turn up more allegations of wrongdoing As he sorts through the mess John Ray III Mr Bankman-Fried successor as boss of ftx has become a de facto federal investigator In a recent visit to Congress he promised to recommend more suspects for criminal charges if he stumbled across candidatesThe bankruptcy court first task is to find those owed money Creditors are usually keen to come forward Not in bankruptcies dealing with crypto For many the attraction of storing wealth this way is its facelessness Lodging a claim requires an id check so creditors must decide quite how deep their desire for privacy runs Investors who include some of tech most illustrious funders are also reluctant to fess up to their involvement To coax them out of hiding the court hasin a highly unusual moveagreed to keep ftx 50 biggest creditors under wraps At the same time Mr Ray is scrambling to locate assets This involves constructing corporate accounts from what he calls the worst record-keeping he has have ever seen ftx did not even keep note of how much customers deposited Billions of dollars were lost by Alameda a sister trading firm Until November 29th lawyers thought there were at least next to no external loans Then BlockFi another bankrupt exchange demanded $500m in shares that ftx held in Robinhood a share-trading platform insisting ftx had put them up as collateral for borrowingSo far Mr Ray has pieced together just a few billion dollars of assets And finding assets is only half the battlegetting at them is harder still In an early fracas American and Bahamian authorities spent months sniping at one another before agreeing to bring tokens worth at least $35bn into American proceedings Mr Ray is also hunting ftx donations Mr Bankman-Fried gave freely to politicians and effective-altruist charities ftx new boss has said he will sue for the moneyAmerican courts have yet to complete a significant crypto restructuring This poses problems Crypto has been around for 15 years but nobody can agree on what it is Token swaps are recorded on virtual ledgers by software on a blockchain which no single person controls This does not fit with property law which assumes people own things because the law says they do or they physically have them in hand Stocks have certificates of ownership; chairs are sat on by their owners In contrast the law does not enforce crypto ledgers and recording something on a blockchain does not conjure a physical coin Thus even creditors that do come forward may not be fully compensated When an exchange trading stocks goes under customers are protected by the Uniform Commercial Code a law that governs commercial transactions in America ftx terms of use explicitly disregard this law On January 4th the judge in another crypto bankruptcy ruled that some of the customers lack ownership rights over their deposits ftx customers may have to wait years to find out what they will receiveIf a settlement is agreed on depositors face a final danger Most of ftx recoverable value will probably be in crypto tokens The one thing such tokens are notlawyers and politicians agreeis currency since money must be backed by a government It seems that when the time comes to carve up ftx assets the court will have to dish out claims in dollars This raises the question of which day exchange rate to use ftx estate holds so many tokens that auctioning them could spark a fire sale burning the tokens’ market value Another route would be to sell accounts to a solvent exchange That would avoid the need to squeeze cash out of tokens no one wants but would keep debris from the worst embarrassment in crypto history floating around for years to comeand require a buyer to be found On January 5th American regulators intervened to stall a deal that would have seen Binance the world largest crypto exchange take on $1bn in assets from Voyager another bankrupt firm There is one certainty from the proceedings to come ftx will go down as it lived: in breathtaking chaos For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 9th 2023,What America protectionist turn means for the world,Step for a moment into the ancient past The year is 2016 Michael Froman the United States Trade Representative is making a stirring call to arms American workers and businesses are competing against firms that get subsidies and other favours from their governments “The question” he says “is what do we do about it? Do we accept this status quo or do we actively work to change it?” Mr Froman choice in line with decades of his country trade policies is the latter: try to tear down the subsidies hurting American exporters and gumming up global tradeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow return to the presentwith a thud America answer to Mr Froman question has been flipped Rather than trying to get other countries to cut subsidies the Biden administration unabashed focus is on building a subsidy architecture of its own complete with the kinds of local-content rules that American officials once railed against Thanks to landmark legislation on semiconductors and greenery passed last year the government is poised to shower $465bn on chips and climate technology Officials have started getting into the nitty-gritty of how to distribute the money; some of the new rules went into effect on January 1st For many in Washingtonboth Democrats and Republicansthis new approach is common sense It is they believe the only way that America can protect its industrial base fend off the challenge from a rising China and reorient the economy towards greener growth But for America allies from Europe to Asia it is a startling shift A country that they had counted on as the stalwart of an open-trading world is instead taking a big step towards protectionism They in turn must decide whether to fight money with money boosting their subsidies to counter America If the result is a global subsidy race the downsides could include a fractured international trading system higher costs for consumers more hurdles to innovation and new threats to political co-operationThe first big crack in America commitment to free trade came when Donald Trump levied tariffs on products from around the world In some ways though it is this second crackthe present ratcheting up of subsidiesthat hurts more “Free trade is dead” is the blunt assessment of a senior Asian diplomat in Washington “It basic game theory When one side breaks the rules others soon break the rules too If you stand still you will lose the most”Although subsidies have long been part of America economic landscape the new plans are notable for both their scale and their America-first emphasis Putting an exact price tag on them is impossible because most of the subsidies will come in the form of tax credits the total size of which will depend on how much companies produce Yet the cumulative impact will be enormous If calculations include infrastructure spending the federal government investment spree may reach $100bn a year over the next decaderoughly twice as much as total subsidies in the pre-pandemic decade Credit Suisse a bank thinks that American solar panels could wind up the cheapest in the world by the late 2020sTo advocates of free trade subsidies are bad in their own right: they make goods produced by one country artificially cheaper reducing economic efficiency America new subsidies are that much more objectionable because in many cases they require recipients to meet local-content thresholds To obtain a $7500 credit towards their purchase of an electric vehicle consumers need to buy a car assembled in North America At least half of the battery components in eligible cars must also be made in North America Wind solar and geothermal projects will all receive heftier subsidies if they use American steel and iron Roughly half of their manufactured components must also be made in America And so the list goes onKilling me lavishlyAmerica protectionist turn has numerous motivations China ascendancy is the starting point American leaders once believed they could get China to rein in the worst of its industrial policies These hopes were dashed giving way to the view that America needs its own industrial policies to avoid becoming reliant on a rival in the technologies of tomorrow Politicians’ concerns about disruption to supply chains early in the covid-19 pandemic strengthened this view as did a desire to boost middle-class jobs Climate change is another reason: spending on renewable energy is expected to lead to a sharp reduction in America carbon emissions The economic thinking that underpins much of this logic is dubious Yet its political momentum is for the time being inexorable That gives rise to two critical questions for countries around the world How big an economic threat are the American subsidies? And how should they respond?As the main target of America measures the answers for China are straightforward Coupled with export controls and sanctions America subsidies are designed to draw business from China This reinforces the Chinese government commitment to greater self-reliance including through its own vast industrial subsidies For America friends though the answers are more complicated When Joe Biden signed America green-tech subsidies into law in August via the Inflation Reduction Act or ira he was met with praise in Europe At last America was on board in the fight against climate change And since everything from cars to supermarkets is bigger in America Mr Biden going big financially was just seen as the American way of doing things Not any more Trade experts in Europe raised the alarm that America subsidies spell trouble for the continent green-tech ambitions Soon enough these concerns percolated up In December Emmanuel Macron the French president called the ira a “killer for our industry” Criticism from America allies in Asia has been more muted but policymakers there are also frustrated by the turn to nationality-based subsidiesThe angrier reaction in Europe is partly because of its weak position The energy crisis provoked by Russia war on Ukraine has hit European firms hard The continent has scrambled to replace cheap piped gas with expensive liquefied gas With its abundant natural resources America has an existing advantage in lower energy prices The new subsidies may give it cheaper renewable power too There is anecdotal evidence that Europe is already losing investment Northvolt a Swedish manufacturer is reviewing its plan for a factory in Germany in favour of its existing American operations Others will follow This readjustment is a source of angst even for some firms Morris Chang founder of tsmc a Taiwanese chipmaker estimates that manufacturing costs in America are 55% higher than in Taiwan Work will be duplicated rather than merely distributed differently The chipmaking giants fret about breaking up networks of expertise in their most advanced manufacturing centres and surrendering the technological leads that sustain their existence Research by Boston Consulting Group suggests investment of between $900bn and $12trn would be required to create multiple self-sufficient semiconductor supply chains around the world with annual operational costs rising by between $45bn and $125bnAt least America semiconductor subsidies do not have the same local-content rules as its green-tech subsidies America allies are now trying to persuade it to soften the latter President Biden suggests America “never intended to exclude folks who were co-operating with us” Practically though it is not easy to recraft the rules Legislation was written precisely specifying amounts timelines and conditions Congress would need to pass formal amendmentsa tall order at the best of times and inconceivable when the House of Representatives is dysfunctional Any adjustments are thus likely to be minor Telling talesGovernments could in theory take America to the World Trade Organisation wto The wto prohibition against subsidies involving local-content requirements is clear Yet so far there is little appetite for such a challenge If America were to lose it could appeal against the ruling which would in effect bring the case to an end since the wto no longer has a viable appellate body thanks to America decision to block appointments Another recourse would be to slap tariffs on American exports benefiting from unfair subsidies That could get very messy Everything from cars to solar panels and hydrogen to semiconductors would be in playInstead governments elsewhere face an invidious choice about whether or not to join the subsidy race There is an economic rationale for staying on the sidelines When America pays for technologies at great cost to its taxpayers these technologies should in time become cheaper for everyone However much America throws at its companies it cannot have a comparative advantage in all products Some officials in Asia cling to the hope that their governments and those in Europe will exercise restraint “That way all non-Americans could have a level playing field with each other” says a Japanese officialBut the voices calling for more subsidies seem to be prevailing The South Korean environment ministry has reportedly informed carmakers that domestic subsidies for electric vehicles could be limited to firms which run their own service centres in the country excluding most foreign companies Japan is making its own efforts to revive the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors Eight domestic firms including Toyota a carmaker and Sony an electronics firm recently announced the formation of a new chipmaking firm Rapidus Then the Japanese government promised ¥70bn $500m in funding for the firm semiconductor research In Europe politicians and businesses want strict state-aid rules to be adjusted so that governments can support industry more lavishly These rules are one of the European single market big success stories helping to ensure competition Politicians including Bruno Le Maire and Robert Habeck the economic ministers of France and Germany and Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission have argued that changes are needed to let more aid flow to strategic sectors more quickly Olaf Scholz the German chancellor is reportedly going to join themAmericans who helped craft the country old trade strategy worry its new approach will backfire Susan Schwab trade representative from 2006 to 2009 argues that many in Europe and Asia will be only too glad to see the doors opened wide to industrial subsidies “We’re never going to subsidise as much or raise as many barriers as our trade partners” she says “So it in our interest that there be a rules-based system and that the rules be enforced”It is an opinion scarcely heard in Washington these days Katherine Tai the current trade representative is a staunch believer in subsidies She has called for America and its allies to co-ordinate their investments in order to maximise their clout Theoretically this is a sound idea America wants allies in Asia and Europe to join its harder line on China; its allies meanwhile want to continue under America security umbrella and would like support in confronting climate changeYet even with the utmost sincerity co-ordination is bound to be fiendishly hard Just as America wants to be at the cutting edge of semiconductor production so do governments in Asia and Europe All have national champions and scores of startups vying for a slice of the action As America and its allies offer more aid these firms will lap it up In the process there will be a duplication of efforts across borders a waste of public funds and recrimination between countries meant to be co-operating It may take hundreds of billions of dollars to relearn why America was once an opponent not an advocate of subsidies For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 5th 2023,Will investors have another awful year in 2023?,After a nightmarish 2022 shell-shocked investors have losses to recoup and plenty to ponder There are asset-class allocations to be made industries to favour or shun and every economic variable under the sun to forecast Professional money managers have the extra headache of working out how to stop nervous clients racing for the exits But one question dominates the rest and it is the impossible one that looms over every crash Is the worst over?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEconomically there is a clear answer: this year will be grim Kristalina Georgieva head of the imf warned on January 1st that a third of the global economy is likely to fall into recession in 2023 Downturns have probably already begun in the euro zone and Britain In a recent poll of economists carried out by the University of Chicago and the Financial Times 85% thought America would follow before the year is outThis does not guarantee another bloodbathit could even mean the opposite In theory markets are forward-looking and fears of recession stalked the world for much of 2022 Such a widely held consensus should be baked into today prices meaning even a marginally better outlook would buoy prices Indeed analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management use the strength of agreement that there will be a recession to argue that stock prices will in fact end 2023 higher than they started They are not alone in their optimism Goldman Sachs researchers think share prices will fall in the near term but recover by the end of the year Deutsche Bank bullish lot reckon the s&p 500 index of large American firms will end the year 17% higher than it now standsIf this year offers a repeat of 2022 with heavy losses for both stocks and bonds it will be an unusual one Stock prices mostly go up They rarely decline two years in a row The s&p 500 last did so two decades ago during the bursting of the dotcom bubble Last year bond rout was on account of the Federal Reserve raising rates at its fastest pace since the 1980s which is unlikely to be repeatedEven so there are reasons to believe more pain lies ahead The first is that shares relative to their underlying earnings remain expensive by historical standards Despite last year plunge the price-to-earnings ratio for “growth” stocks those of companies promising big future profits has fallen back only to where it was in 2019 This was its highest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 a level which was reached after a decade-long bull market True “value” stocks those with a low price compared with the firm book assets look more attractive But as recession sets in both types are vulnerable to earnings downgrades that are for the most part yet to materialise Moreover today valuations were reached during an unusual period: one in which central banks pumped endless liquidity into the market via quantitative easing qe By buying government bonds with newly created money the Fed and others depressed yields and nudged investors to seek returns in riskier assets like stocks Now these qe programmes are being kicked into reverse One consequence is that governments will rely much more on private investors to hold their debt In the fiscal year of 2022-23 America Treasury may need to borrow almost twice as much from investors as it did during each of the two years preceding the covid-19 pandemic and four times the average in the five years before that Even without central banks raising short-term interest rates this glut could drive bond prices down and yields up Just as in 2022 stocks would therefore be left looking less attractive by comparisonThe final reason for gloom is a divergence between economists and investors Although wonks are betting on a recession many punters still hope one can be avoided Markets expect the Fed benchmark rate to hit a peak of below 5% in the first half of this year before declining The central bank governors disagree They project that the interest rate will end the year above 5% Thus investors are betting either that inflation will fall to target more quickly than the Fed expects or that the monetary guardians do not have the heart to inflict the pain it would take to get it down There is of course a chance they will be proved right But markets spent much of 2022 underestimating the Fed hawkishness only to be put in their place by Jerome Powell the central bank governor at meeting after meeting If the pattern repeats 2023 will be another miserable year for investors Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:India stockmarkets are roaring They also have serious faults Dec 20thFor bond investors every country is an emerging market now Dec 8thHas private equity avoided the asset-price crash?

daily life stood still for months on end A cosmopolitan class of young wealthy Chinese was forced to come to grips with a life without international travel Foreign entrepreneurs and executives were

firm compared with what it would have produced had its reopening resembled the rest of the world Restrictions on movement snarled the most advanced global supply chains In November profits at industrial firms dropped by 9% year on year Meanwhile exchanges between China and the outside world fell to their lowest in decades Few foreign students remain Overseas tourism has collapsed Mr Xi has only recently resumed foreign travel after remaining in China for two-and-a-half years Zero-covid lasted longer than anyone initially expected then collapsed faster than anyone could have imagined In a matter of weeks China has gone from some of the world strictest restrictions to almost none For the population at large fear of lockdowns and quarantine has vanished Following a period of turbulence economic activity is likely to rebound sharply Increased demand for energy and commodities will be felt around the world Investors and multinational executives will soon be able to visit offices and

gain strength as the year progresses Li Pengfei until recently a product manager at an industrial-software firm in Beijing is among those desperate for a return to normality Mr Li lost his job in February when restrictions made basic duties such as travelling to meet clients near-impossible He spent part of last year living with his sister but was forced to return home to Jilin province in China far northeast where economic prospects were dismal even before the pandemic “Things seem so volatile that even the big companies are downsizing” he says Elsewhere in the world bosses worry about a “great resignation” with workers quitting jobs or dropping out of the labour force altogether This is less of a concern in China The government did not hand out stimulus cheques willy-nilly as America did during the pandemic People who lost jobs such as Mr Li will return to work when the opportunity arises economists believe helping to steady factory outputXi spending spreeConsumption will rise too Incomes have fallen but zero-covid also squashed spending as people avoided travelling and eating out All told households saved one-third of their income last year Many will be getting back on their feet after job losses stagnating pay and declines in the value of their homes meaning the splurge will be limited But Jacqueline Rong of bnp Paribas a bank reckons household consumption will

opposed to speculative purchases To that end they may make further cuts to mortgage rates and down-payment requirementsForecasts for the performance of the property sector broadly defined to include construction services and furnishings range widely Activity in the industry could grow by 3% this year according to Jing Liu of hsbc a bankenough to add 09 percentage points to China gdp growth A more optimistic scenario has activity expanding by 5% she thinks adding 15 points to growth Some households might decide that now is a good time to “buy the dip” before prices revive or regulatory restrictions on home purchases return The economic implications of reopening extend further afield Zero-covid kept a lid on China demand for global goods services and commodities During the lockdown of Shanghai in the first half of last year for instance the country oil demand fell by 2m barrels per day In the past such drops in Chinese spending would have deprived the world economy of a crucial engine of growth The covid downturn has been different It coincided with an overheated economy in America and an interrupted supply of energy across Europe “At least this time China isn’t contributing to inflation” says Louis Kuijs of s&p Global a rating agencyChina recovery will lift global growth for the simple reason that the country is a large part of the world economy hsbc reckons that one year from now in the first quarter of 2024 China gdp could be as much as 10% higher than it will be in the first three troubled months of 2023 see chart 1 According to our rough calculation a recovering China could account for two-thirds of global growth in that period In time however China recovery may have unfortunate side-effects In other big economies the binding constraint on economic expansion is monetary policy as central banks raise interest rates to suppress inflation If China reopening looks like raising global demand and therefore price pressure to an uncomfortable degree central banks elsewhere may have to respond by tightening policy to offset the threat In such a scenario the impact of China reopening on the rest of the world may show up not in higher growth but in higher inflation or interest rates China most direct channel of influence is through commodities It consumes almost one-fifth of the world oil over half of refined copper nickel and zinc and more than three-fifths of iron ore On November 4th the mere rumour of a reopening caused a 7% increase in the price of copper by the end of the day As the rumours are realised China demand for metals crops and energy will help exporters of commodities hurt importers and give the world central banks another headache in their fight against inflationHeavy metal demandChina appetite for metals remained strong during zero-covid as the government encouraged spending on electric vehicles renewable energy and other forms of green infrastructure all of which require lots of aluminium copper and other metals But buyers lacked the confidence to stock up on these materials: inventories of copper fell to their skimpiest in 15 years Reopening will encourage restocking In November Goldman Sachs a bank reckoned the price of copper would increase to $9000 per tonne within 12 months Now it thinks the price will reach $11000 Demand for energy proved less resilient particularly towards the end of zero-covid China imports of liquefied natural gas lng fell by about one-fifth in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year This allowed Europe to increase purchases to make up for the loss of Russian gas Thus China zero-covid policy acted as a counterweight to Russia invasion of Ukraineone blunder helping to save Europe from the otherAnalysts assume a modest rise in Chinese lng imports this year based on the contracts buyers have already signed and their reluctance to buy lng when prices are high If imports recover faster Europe could feel the pinch In a stress test in December the International Energy Agency iea an official forecaster assumed Chinese demand would increase by about a quarter in the year ahead returning to 2021 levels; Russia would cut off piped gas to Europe entirely; and winter would start punctually In such a scenario Europe would face a shortfall of 27bn cubic metres of gas equivalent to 7% of annual demand even after its current efforts to increase supply are taken into account The iea warns that if nothing else is done Europe may be forced to introduce rationing The impact on oil could also be significant If China economy makes a full recovery in 2023 it will gradually increase crude imports throughout the year until it has added an average of 1m barrels a day reckons Soni Kumari of anz a bank This will compensate for reduced demand in Europe and America both of which are courting recession Indeed Goldman Sachs forecasts that China increased appetite could push up oil prices by about $15 per barrel The price of Brent could exceed $100 again in the third quarter of this year it reckons making the global battle against inflation still more difficultHigher commodity prices will be a boon to exporters like Chile and Brazil but hurt China energy-importing neighbours For India the loss from higher prices may cancel out gains from increased exports to the mainland Other countries more tightly enmeshed in China manufacturing supply chain seem better placed to benefit But raw statistics can be deceptive Although Taiwan merchandise exports to the mainland were equivalent to more than 15% of gdp in 2021 many were components for products that are ultimately sold to customers outside China and may thus be unaffected by the change of policyThe biggest boost to neighbours will come not from selling goods to China but from selling tourist destinations to Chinese citizens see chart 2 Ni Na a mother of two from Shanghai travelled overseas about five times a year pre-pandemic often spending three or four months a year outside the country She attempted to travel once within China in 2022 only to give up owing to restrictions When quarantine requirements are lifted Ms Ni will get back on the road She has renewed her passport and her sons’ travel documents in anticipation  China leap forwardThailand a popular destination could enjoy a three-percentage-point boost to growth once China has fully reopened reckons Goldman Sachs That would remove the uncertainty weighing on local asset prices including the currency says Arup Raha of Oxford Economics reducing pressure on the central bank to raise rateswelcome freedom in a country where output is still below potential But the biggest winner will be Hong Kong Increased exports which include tourism could boost its gdp by almost 8% after full reopening The city used to attract more than 4m mainland visitors a month Without them it has felt roomier but poorerThe Communist Party is deft at rewriting history Yet Mr Xi will struggle to shake the damage done to his reputation in 2022 The clumsy enforcement of zero-covid followed by its hasty abandonment will go down as an error for the ages Many investment houses adjusted their risk assessments for China and will allocate less to the country over the next three years unless they are compensated for it About $18bn of foreign exchange flowed out of China in November up from $11bn in October These outflows are expected to reverse when China economy stabilises in 2023 but a swift return to the type of inflows witnessed before the pandemic is unlikelyDeep damage has been done to parts of China supply chain A covid outbreak followed by protests at a plant making Apple iPhone 14 in central China has delayed orders for the product For foreign firms the crisis was the first time that central policy interfered with local officials’ commitment to keep factories running Many companies are now willing to pay more to manufacture elsewhere Take the process of launching new products which requires an almost continuous flow of researchers and scientists between headquarters usually in the West and plants in China The covid years made this dance impossible Engineers stopped visiting; fewer new products were launched in the country Multinational firms have been forced often reluctantly to launch elsewhereBut after years of zero-covid bosses have become more comfortable with moving away from China Inbound investment in new “greenfield” factories has plummeted see chart 3 At the same time the number of firms moving operations out of China has jumped says Alex Bryant of East West Associates a supply-chain consultant Most of the moves Mr Bryant firm has assisted with over the past year have been outbound He thinks the reopening of China is unlikely to lead to an immediate turnaround in the direction of trafficA thousand meetingsPolicymakers are waking up to the danger Officials and businessfolk from Fujian Guangdong Sichuan Zhejiang and elsewhere are planning trips abroad to win back investors according to a state-media report “A meeting is worth a thousand emails” it said In December China leaders announced a focus on attracting foreign money emphasising that local governments should prioritise finding investors Such language has not been used at a Politburo meeting in many years notes Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley a bank “They clearly want to keep their place in the global supply chain” he says Nevertheless making up for the chaos of 2022 will require an awful lot of meetings For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance

 Dec 29th 2022,In 2022 Russia kept the economic show on the road,The past year has been bruising for Russia economy Foreign investors fled en masse many never to return Official forecasts suggest that few countries will see their gdp shrink by more this year Only a handful of countries including war-torn Ukraine will end up posting worse numbers From another perspective however Russia did surprisingly well In the days following its invasion of Ukraine in February there was financial chaos from Moscow to Vladivostok After Western countries imposed an unprecedented number of sanctions the stockmarket collapsed along with the rouble At the time it seemed Vladimir Putin “Fortress Russia” was crumblingEconomists quickly downgraded their forecasts Within days the consensus estimate of annual gdp growth in 2022 dropped from 25% to a contraction of 10% Some economists were even gloomier: the White House looked for a year-on-year decline in Russian gdp of 15% Inflation surged across the countryRussia faced a squeeze on both the supply and demand sides of the economy Western businesses were pulling out by the dozen limiting what Russians could buy Meanwhile the central bank doubled interest rates raising debt-servicing costs and thus further squeezing demandWithin a few weeks however it became clear that the worst forecasts were not going to come to pass Sanctions have gravely damaged parts of Russia industrial base such as the car sector which relies on foreign parts Others in particular those enjoined by the state to help out with the war effort have not done too badly During the summer and the autumn economists revised up their growth forecasts Now they expect the Russian economy to shrink by some 3-4% this year Unemployment has barely budged in part because firms have been told to keep workers on even if on lower or no pay Two main reasons explain why Russia downturn has proved shallower than expected: policy and trade In the early days of the invasion the quick actions of the central bank and regulators convinced ordinary Russians that they were serious about tackling surging inflation Inflation expectations having jumped came back down again Higher interest rates encouraged the public to return money that they had taken out from their bank accounts in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic preventing a financial crisis Sanctions have been tough but for most of 2022 there were few restrictions on the sale of hydrocarbons that is now changing So far this year Russia has racked up a current-account surplus of over $220bn twice its level the year before This foreign currency has helped finance imports Many Western firms have stopped selling their goods and services to Russia But companies in other parts of the world are only too happy to helpChina for instance have stepped up Turkey appears to have become a go-between for Western companies looking to skirt sanctions Russian imports have recovered a long way after a sharp drop in the spring“Real-time” economic data paint a concerning picture for the West At present the Russian economy is in better shape than expected Meanwhile Europe weighed down by sky-high energy costs is falling into recession 
 Dec 21st 2022,Five financial trends that 2022 killed,Financial markets’ nastiest surprises often come when something that is taken for granted is suddenly called into questionwhether it rising tulip-bulb prices functioning banks or a lockdown-free existence Investors had a tough time in 2022 But given how many trends changed direction over the course of the year the real surprise is that it was not nastier Here were the most important reversalsEnd of cheap moneyFuture financial historians looking back at the 2010s will marvel that people really thought interest rates would stay near zero forever Even in 2021 respectable investment houses were publishing articles with titles such as: “The Zero: Why interest rates will stay low” Borrowing costs had been falling for decades; the combination of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the covid-19 pandemic seemed to have permanently glued them to the floor In 2022 persistent high inflation dissolved the glue America Federal Reserve embarked on its swiftest tightening cycle since the 1980s raising the target range for its benchmark interest rate by more than four percentage points to 425-45% Other central banks followed in its wake Markets expect rates to stop climbing in 2023 with peaks of between 45% and 5% in Britain and America and 3% and 35% in the euro zone But the odds of them collapsing back to nothing are slim The Fed governors for instance think its rate will finish 2023 above 5% before settling down to around 25% in the longer run The era of free money is over Death of the long bull marketBull markets don’t die of old age goes the adage: they are murdered by central banks And so it was in 2022 although the long bull run that ended had grown older than most From the post-financial crisis depths of 2009 to its peak at the end of 2021 the s&p 500 index of leading American shares rose by 600% Interruptions to the upwards marchsuch as the sudden drop at the outset of the pandemicwere dramatic but short-lived This year crash has proved lasting The s&p 500 fell by a quarter to its lowest point this year in mid-October and remains down 20% msci index of global shares has fallen by 20% Nor are stocks the only asset class to have been bludgeoned Share prices have fallen in part because interest rates have risen raising the returns on bonds and making riskier assets less attractive by comparison The same mechanism pushed down bond prices to align their yields with prevailing rates Indices compiled by Bloomberg a data provider of global American European and emerging-market bonds have dropped by 16% 12% 18% and 15% respectively Whether or not prices fall further the “bull market in everything” has come to a closeEvaporating capitalCapital was not just cheap in the last years of the bull market it was seemingly everywhere Central banks’ quantitative easing qe programmes devised during the financial crisis to stabilise markets went into overdrive during the pandemic Together the central banks of America Britain euro area and Japan pumped out more than $11trn of newly created money using it to hoover up “safe” assets such as government bonds and depress their yieldsThis pushed investors in search of returns into more speculative corners of the market In turn these assets boomed In the decade to 2007 American firms issued $100bn of the riskiest high-yield or “junk” debt a year In the 2010s they averaged $270bn In 2021 they hit $486bnThis year it has fallen by three-quarters The Fed and the Bank of England have put their bond-buying programmes into reverse; the European Central Bank is preparing to do likewise Liquidity is draining away and not just from the risky end of the debt market Initial-public offerings ipos smashed all records in 2021 raising $655bn globally Now American ipos are set for their leanest year since 1990 The value of mergers and acquisitions has fallen too albeit less dramatically Capital abundance has turned to capital scarcityValue beats growthThe bull run was a dispiriting time for “value” investors who hunt for stocks that are cheap relative to their underlying earnings or assets Low interest rates and qe-fuelled risk-taking put this cautious approach firmly out of fashion Instead “growth” stocks promising explosive future profits at a high price compared with their often non-existent current earnings stormed ahead From March 2009 to the end of 2021 msci index of global growth stocks rocketed by a factor of 64 more than twice the increase of the equivalent value indexThis year rising interest rates turned the tables With rates at 1% to have $100 in ten years’ time you must deposit $91 in a bank account today With rates at 5% you need only put away $61 The end of cheap money shortens investors’ horizons forcing them to prefer immediate profits to those in the distant future Growth stocks are out Value is back in vogueCrypto implodes againThose who think crypto is good for nothing but gambling and dubious activities could not hope for a better example than the fall of ftx The crypto exchange was also supposedly the industry respectable face run by Sam Bankman-Fried a 30-year-old philanthropist and political donor Yet in November the firm collapsed into bankruptcy with some $8bn of customer funds missing American authorities now call it a “massive years-long fraud” Mr Bankman-Fried has been arrested and faces criminal charges If convicted he could spend the rest of his life in jailftx downfall marked the bursting of crypto most recent bubble At its peak in 2021 the market value of all cryptocurrencies was almost $3trn up from nearly $800bn at the start of the year It has since fallen back to around $800bn Like so much else the affair roots lie in the era of cheap abundant money and the anything-goes mentality it created 
 Dec 21st 2022,2022 has been a year of brutal inflation,“Low inflation is indeed the problem of this era” Thus said John Williams president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in late 2019 espousing the dominant view at the time Fast forward to the present and the problem is the exact opposite Just about every country in the world has grappled with soaring prices in 2022 The situation is all but certain to improve in the coming year but at a severe cost to economic growthWhat made 2022 so unusual was the breadth of price pressures The global rate of inflation will finish the year at roughly 9% For many developing countries high inflation is a recurrent challenge But the last time that inflation was so elevated in rich countries was the early 1980s In America consumer prices are on track to have risen by about 7% in 2022 the highest in four decades In Germany the rate will be closer to 10% its first bout of double-digit inflation since 1951The common factors driving up inflation everywhere were soaring fuel and food costs Prices for many consumer goods were already trending up at the start of 2022 because of covid-19 lingering impact on supply chains Russia invasion of Ukraine in February proved even more disruptive The cost of oil climbed by a third as Western countries slapped sanctions on Russia a major crude producer Food prices also surged pushed up by fertiliser and transportation costs as well as by Russia blockades of grain exports from Ukraine a major wheat producer In economic terms this amounted to a classic supply shock The sudden rise in prices for key commodities quickly filtered into daily life for the world citizens In Europe long reliant on Russian gas millions will struggle to afford heating this winter Across all regions food and fuel accounted on average for more than half of inflation in 2022 see chartWere inflation just a supply-side phenomenon it would have been painful enough But the most worrying development for central bankers was that pressures seeped into “core” components of price indicesthat is goods and services other than volatile food and energy The rise in core prices was an indication that inflation was gathering momentum all of its own That in turn pointed to causes beyond the oil shock Many countries now have ultra-tight labour markets partly a result of a wave of early retirements during covid As a result companies are paying higher wages to attract workers adding to inflationary momentum In America where the rise in core inflation was particularly steep an additional culprit was excessive stimulusby both the government and the Fedat the height of covid For much of 2022 that translated into overheated demand with real personal spending higher than the pre-pandemic trend Tellingly the big economy with the lowest inflation was China Its “zero-covid” strategy pushed spending far below the pre-pandemic trendAlmost everywhere there was anxiety that rising prices would reset people inflation expectations leading them to demand higher pay Known as a wage-price spiral such a dynamic would make inflation far harder to eradicate The mere threat of the dynamic was sufficient to stir central banks to action The Fed was the most aggressive raising interest rates from a floor of zero in March to more than 4% today its sharpest dose of monetary tightening in four decades Central banks throughout the rich world from Stockholm to Sydney followed in its wakeOne way of looking at inflation prospects for 2023 is as a duel between rebounding supply and falling demand Promisingly some of the factors that fuelled inflation early in 2022 have started to fade Prices of consumer goods have declined as supply chains have returned to normal The cost of oil has fallen back to its level a year ago in part thanks to a recovery in production Tighter monetary policy works by choking off demand and that is starting to happen too The most rate-sensitive sectors are suffering the most: a sudden chill has settled over once-sizzling property markets with transactions drying up If the recovery in supplyincluding crucially of willing workersis big and fast enough central banks may be able to stop tightening before provoking a deep recession But at this point it seems more likely that they will exact a real toll on the global economy In 2023 fears of inflation may give way to concerns about unemployment 
 Dec 20th 2022,2023 will bring the true test of the West oil-war tactics,The west has been trying to cut Russia oil-export revenues without causing global prices to spike since February Both aims are seemingly being achieved at present Russia exports as much oil as before its invasion of Ukraine but Urals crude the main grade it pumps trades at a 37% discount to Brent the global benchmark meaning Moscow gets a poor deal Brent meanwhile has fallen to an annual low of around $80 a barrel see chart meaning consumers face less of an energy crunch Little of this is down to Western efforts On December 14th and 15th central banks in America Britain and the eu announced interest-rate rises and signalled more would come sucking demand from the economy China reeling from soaring covid-19 cases posted its worst factory and retail data in six months Members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries opec and its allies are producing nearly as much as before a cut to their collective target was announced in October since most were already pumping below their quotasThe West boycott of Urals which accounts for 10-15% of the world crude supply is probably bringing its price down a bit as the grade undercuts others An exemption to Europe ban on insurance for tankers carrying Russian oil which applies to buyers that agree to pay a maximum of $60 per barrel may be helping to prevent a supply shock But neither measure is having a huge impact If economic or market conditions change prices could jumpMoreover financial punters seem to have had a greater hand than usual in depressing recent prices which could portend a sudden upwards correction when the fundamentals of supply and demand kick back in An industry source points to large “sell” orders being placed every day at 2pm London time in recent weeks Events that should push up prices such as the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline in America one of the world largest on December 9th seem to have barely registered notes Saad Rahim of Trafigura a trading firm By the second quarter of 2023 there may be another oil shortage Industrial users in Europe are switching from natural gas to cheaper gasoil Consumption in India and the Middle East is proving more resilient than expected China reopening will probably fuel an economic rebound after cases peak There are already signs that Europe insurance ban could end up proving more disruptive than expected The iea an official forecaster reckons Russia will be forced to cut output by 16m b/d to 96m b/d by the second quarter Loadings of a minor Russian grade called ESPO which unlike Urals recently traded above $60 have nearly halved since December 5th when the cap was introduced Should rising oil demand push the price of Urals above $60 ship owners may well have second thoughts about carrying it too Russia has threatened to cut supply to countries that abide by the cap and growth elsewhere is projected to be sluggish A deficit in global supply would eat into already slim global stocks which remain close to five-year lows causing prices to rise still further All this means that the true test of the West oil-war tactics will probably arrive next year 
 Dec 20th 2022,The Federal Reserve great anti-hero deserves a second look,Since inflation took off a former Federal Reserve chair has been on the minds of politicians and pundits A number have argued that Jerome Powell the current incumbent must not become the next Arthur Burns As chair of the Fed in the 1970s Burns represents central-banking failure: a weak leader who blinked in the face of inflation and steered the economy towards disaster Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is not that this warning from history is incorrect Richard Nixon picked Burns to run the Fed viewing him as a friend who would do his bidding Despite stubborn inflation Nixon pressed Burns to cut interest rates in 1971 thinking it would help him win re-election Sure enough the Fed did just that Nixon was re-elected and inflation soared hitting double digits by 1974But the story is more complicated than the basic outlines suggest and its complexity contains lessons for today policymakers With the holiday season upon usand with the Fed approaching a turning point in monetary policyit is a fine time to reassess the legacy of the much-maligned central bankerStart with what happened after inflation took off The Fed jacked up interest rates from 3% in 1972 to 13% in 1974 one of its sharpest-ever doses of tightening and enough to help tip the economy into a deep recession Doing so took some of the heat out of price growth with inflation settling at around 6% for the remainder of Burns tenure This was uncomfortably high and Burns never delivered the death blow to inflation that Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s Nevertheless his initial assault heralded a new era In 2016 economists from the Fed branch in Richmond assessed monetary-policy settings over the years Their model suggested that the “Volcker shock” had not appeared like a bolt from the blue Burns had laid the groundwork for itHe did this in formidable circumstances An oil shock that began in 1973 led to a near quadrupling in energy prices as well as a surge in food costs A second oil shock in 1978 just after Burns left the Fed kicked off another inflationary surge Given this backdrop how much of the inflation can truly be blamed on the Fed? A review written in 2008 by Alan Blinder and Jeremy Rudd two economists found that supply-side factors were decisive They calculated that the energy and food crises accounted for more than 100% of the rise in headline inflation relative to its baseline level The Fed could have reacted more strongly given that inflation had already been unanchored But Burns was not responsible for the massive shocks facing the economyBurns troubles also illustrate the pitfalls of real-time indicators The Fed today is seen as “data-dependent” If inflation momentum stays relatively weak its next rate rise is likely to be one quarter of a percentage point; if inflation shoots back up a half-point rise may be on the menu That is entirely reasonable But consider the head-fake of 1975 Initial data from the first quarter registered a 10% annualised drop in gdp and a remission in price pressure The Fed cut rates aggressively Subsequent revisions showed that the gdp loss was only about 5% and that inflation had remained persistent If this had been known at the time Burns Fed might well have acted differentlyThat real-time figures may be flawed is on one level not terribly helpful: it is impossible to know whether future revisions will push growth up or down Yet this uncertainty does counsel against overreacting to limited data Having tightened policy so much over the past year the Fed wants to proceed more gingerly Even if there is an upside surprise in inflation between now and its next meeting in February sticking to that gradualism may still be the right coursejust as Mr Powell has avoided reading too much into an apparent inflation slowdown in NovemberThe main economic outcome associated with Burns Fed is of course high inflation But his relatively loose policy also fuelled an investment boom Capital expendituresthat is money spent by businesses on things such as buildings and equipmentreached about a third of American gdp in 1978 which still stands as the highest level since at least 1946 Responding to the supply shocks at the time much of that went into energy and commodity production Jeffrey Currie of Goldman Sachs a bank recently noted that these investments helped to “de-bottleneck” oil and metals production capacity for decades setting the economy up for lower inflation in the long runToday the world economy is at another inflection point The frayed global trading system declining immigration and climate change may well constrain America productivity leading to persistently lower growth and higher inflation There is also renewed debate among economists about whether the Fed should pursue a slightly higher inflation target than 2% Such a switch could help it to avoid squeezing the economy too hard amid profound challenges The Fed task is to accurately forecast the future shape of the economy and its interaction with monetary policy The deep effects of the 1970s’ investment boom are a reminder that it must pay heed to the current array of economic structural shiftsFirst-degree BurnsThe closer one examines Burns record the more that complexities emerge The former Fed chair carefully managed the dissolution of a major bank in 1974 in an augury of the central bank present framework of letting bad firms fail so long as doing so does not precipitate a financial crisis His advocacy of wage controls is now seen as a classic example of bad policy doomed to failure Yet the context was a powerful union movement which had locked in upward cost-of-living adjustmentssomething that no longer exists Even his relationship with Nixon is far from straightforward Burns was no sycophant and did at least try to resist the president bullying All this provides the final and most important lesson from the Fed great anti-hero: historical analogies are useful but rarely the whole story Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The insidious threats to central-bank independence Dec 15thTackling sexual harassment could bring sizeable economic dividends Dec 8thA playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation Dec 1stFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 20th 2022,China leaders ponder an economy without lockdownsor crackdowns,Each december the leaders of China Communist Party gather to discuss their “economic work” for the year ahead The lengthy statement they then release to the public provides a clue to their thinking and priorities But by the time the leaders met on December 15th and 16th in Beijing the most fateful economic choice of the next 12 months had already been madeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhether by accident or design local officials did not impose lockdowns in November on anything like the scale required to stop a widespread covid-19 outbreak Their decision if that is what it can be called has brought an abrupt end to China “zero-covid” policy Now unable to defeat the virus China central government says it is too mild to be worth vanquishingThis will be a great boon to China economyeventually Before the country can reach that happier future it will have to navigate the world last great infection wave According to hsbc a bank growth could fall below zero in the first quarter of 2023 compared with a year earlierThe economy faces near-term threats to both supply and demand Some members of the workforce will fall ill; others will take time off to look after stricken relatives Schools have moved online in parts of China trapping parents at home As hospitals fill local officials may try again to slow the disease spread by limiting traffic between regions gumming up logistics The bigger threat is to confidence and spending Many Chinese came to resent the “zero-covid” regime but lots still fear the disease According to a survey by Bank of America some 61% will stay home or go out less as infections rise In November retail sales fell by more than 7% adjusted for inflation compared with a year earlier In Beijing where the virus is spreading rapidly shopping centres are unusually quiet even as fever clinics and some bars are packed with people seeking relief for their body or spirit The threat of infection in the country capital is so bad the National Bureau of Statistics cancelled its regular press conference reviewing the month economic figuresas good an indicator of China predicament as anything the bureau normally publishesThus the country leaders will have their economic work cut out in 2023 But you would not necessarily know that from reading their statement Just as China headline economic statistics are often suspiciously smooth the statements China releases after its economic work conference are also artificially consistent They repeat phrases “proactive fiscal policy” and slogans “housing is for living in not for speculation” from previous years Presumably the aim is to create the impression of stability and continuity In last week statement China abrupt swerve away from the “zero-covid” policy is mentioned only in passing The statement notes that China will focus on the elderly and vulnerable and calibrate its response to infections to “get through the latest covid-19 pandemic period smoothly”The statement does though recognise some of the dangers of a post-zero-covid world China leaders must revive market confidence at home and restore China appeal to investors abroad most of whom have not visited for years “Improving public confidence and expectations” is listed as a good starting point for economic strategy in 2023 To foreign investors China leaders promise “maximum convenience”The statement also provides a rare acknowledgment of criticism or what it calls “incorrect” interpretations It addresses the view that China has become inhospitable to private enterprise and indisposed to reforming its big state-owned enterprises Examples include a clampdown on indebted property developers and a regulatory blitz that humbled some of the country most successful e-commerce firms in 2021 In response the statement promises China will make clear its adherence to the “two unswervings” the name the party gives to its double commitment to consolidate the state sector and support the private sector Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley another bank thinks China regulatory macroeconomic and covid policies are aligned in favour of growth for the first time in three years Others are more sceptical The government attempt to repair confidence is like breaking a horse into pieces reassembling it and expecting it to run again according to one netizen The doubters will want to see more evidence that China is as committed to private enterprise as it is to its market-friendly slogans Official rhetoric is not always a good guide to policy If it were China would still be persisting victoriously with zero-covid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 20th 2022,The Bank of Japan shocks investors,In recent months anticipation had grown that in 2023 the Bank of Japan boj would at last tighten monetary policy after years of no-holds-barred stimulus Almost nobody expected it to happen in 2022 But on December 20th the bank lifted its cap on ten-year government-bond yields from 025% to 05% The Christmas surprise caused the yen to surgeand set off speculation about what might come nextListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSince 2016 the boj has intervened in bond markets to keep the ten-year bond yield at around 0% a policy known as “yield-curve control” Technically the bank permitted fluctuations of a quarter of a percentage point around the 0% goal But the upper limit of 025% is what mattered especially this year as upward pressure on yields built around the globe Now the boj will allow moves of half a percentage point around zero After the announcement the ten-year bond yield surged from 025% to 04% its biggest daily shift since 2003The boj had been a global outlier maintaining ultra-loose policy even as America Federal Reserve and other central banks chose to raise interest rates sharply Japan benchmark interest rate of -01% has not moved in almost seven years and the bank owns over half of the government bond market Yield-curve control was implemented as a way of allowing the boj to control long-term interest rates without running out of bonds to buy Paradoxically when central banks credibly promise to peg the price of an asset they often need not intervene much to enforce the policy The market implements the peg by itselfFor most of the policy history that more or less worked In 2022 however the peg has come under considerable pressure as traders have speculated that monetary policy would need to be tightened The chasm between the policies of Japan and those in the rest of the rich world caused the yen to plunge by 23% against the dollar from the start of 2022 to mid-October In October annual inflation was 36% a 40-year high and well above the BOJ 2% target Though most of the inflation was imported many central banks have been caught out since the covid-19 pandemic by assuming price growth will cool without tighter monetary policyYet it was widely assumed that any pivot by the boj would come after its current governor Kuroda Haruhiko leaves in April That policymakers moved faster makes sense: it spares the boj months of bond-buying to enforce the old cap and the greater losses it would endure on its bigger bond portfolio How far will Japan central bank now go? After the announcement the dollar fell by 34% against the yen but the Japanese currency remains at its weakest level in two decades Economists are watching the shunto Japan springtime wage negotiations between large companies and trade unions for more signs of inflation Japanese firms raised winter bonuses by 97% according to Nikkei a business newspaper the largest such increase since 1975Mr Kuroda claims that he has not tightened monetary policy only responded to volatile market conditions Yet the announcement was his “sayonara present” according to Jesper Koll of Monex Group a Japanese brokerage “It opens the door for ‘Operation Freedom’ for whoever his successor will be” Japanese financial markets could be in for a turbulent 2023 For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 18th 2022,2022 unlikely economic winners,In financial terms the past year has been bad for almost everyone Inflation of 10% year-on-year across the rich world has slashed household incomes Investors have lost out as global stockmarkets have plunged by 20% Yet this poor aggregate performance hides wide differences: some countries have done pretty well Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo assess these differences The Economist has compiled data on five economic and financial indicatorsgdp inflation inflation breadth stockmarket performance and government debtfor 34 mostly rich countries We have ranked each economy according to how well it has done on these measures and created an overall score The table at the end of this article shows the rankings It includes some unexpected results For the first time in a while the economic party is happening in the Mediterranean Top of our list is Greece Other countries that plumbed the economic depths in the early 2010s including Portugal and Spain also score highly They are not the only pleasant surprises Despite political chaos Israel did well Meanwhile despite political stability Germany is an underperformer Two Baltic countries Estonia and Latvia which won plaudits in the 2010s for speedy reforms come bottom gdp usually the best measure of economic health is our first indicator Norway helped by high oil prices and Turkey by a boom in sanctions-busting trade with Russia have done better than most The fallout from covid-19 also looms large Thanks to strict lockdowns and a collapse in tourism a year ago much of southern Europe was in dire straits so the region was due a decent year Visits to the Balearics recently rebounded beyond their pre-pandemic level As your correspondent discovered on a recent trip to Ibiza the island is so busy it is difficult to book a taxi or find a spot at a half-decent restaurantIreland probably had a strong year though one not nearly as strong as gdp numbers suggest The activities of big multinational companies many registered there for tax purposes have for years distorted the figures By contrast America gdp numbers are misleadingly weak: in recent quarters official statisticians have struggled to account for the impact of enormous stimulus packages More granular data fill in the picture Our second measure is the change in the price level since the end of 2021 Away from the world attention some countries have seen low inflation In Switzerland consumer prices have risen by just 3% The country central bank helped along by a strong currency responded rapidly to the rise in prices earlier this year Countries which have non-Russian energy sourcessuch as Spain which gets much of its gas from Algeriahave also done better than average Those reliant on Vladimir Putin for fuel have truly suffered In Latvia average consumer prices have risen by a fifth Our third measure also relates to inflation It calculates the share of items in each country inflation basket where prices have risen by more than 2% in the past year This provides an indication of how entrenched inflation isand therefore hints at how quickly inflation will fall over the coming year Some countries that suffer from high headline inflation have nonetheless been able to limit its breadth In Italy for instance average consumer prices have risen by 11% this year yet “only” two-thirds of its inflation basket has above-target inflation Japanese inflation also looks like it may fade away Britain is in more trouble The price of every category in its basket is rising fast People sense of economic well-being does not just come from prices in the shops They also look at the value of their pension pots and stock portfolios In some countries it has been a terrible year for these sorts of investments Share prices in both Germany and South Korea are down by nearly a fifth in 2022 double America decline Swedish stocks have done even worse Yet there are a few spots of strength Norway stockmarket is up on the year So is Britain which is populated by the sort of dull plodding companies that tend to be rewarded when economic times are tough A fall in the value of the pound has also increased the value of foreign salesOur final measure concerns the change in net government debt as a share of gdp In the short run ministers are able to paper over economic cracks by increasing spending or cutting taxes However this can create more debt and thus the need to turn the fiscal screws in the future Some governments have spent extravagantly to cope with the cost-of-living squeeze Germany has allocated funds worth about 7% of gdp to help with sky-high energy costs meaning its debt-to-gdp ratio has risen Other countries have pulled back from the splurge helping to right the fiscal ship Assisted by high inflation public debt in southern European countries seems to be on the way down Will the gap between 2022 winners and losers persist in 2023? Before long southern Europe economic growth weighed down by rapidly ageing populations and high debts will surely fall back to the region usual less-than-stellar levels And there are hopeful signs that in countries such as America and Britain high inflation may finally be easing which would help them up the rankings Along other dimensions differences are likely to persist not least when it comes to those countries reliant on Mr Putin for their energy supplies Against the odds many managed to replenish their stores of natural gas before winter set inbut only by paying outrageous prices With supplies now largely cut off the coming year will be a lot more difficult That will be a big concern in the Baltics but less so on the other side of Europe It is hard to worry about gas supplies while eating a giant plate of squid on an Ibicencan beach For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 15th 2022,The struggle to put a carbon price on a flight,Few topics annoy green activists as much as air travel Planes account for a sliver of total carbon-dioxide emissions roughly 25%but unlike heating other transport and electricity journeys on them are often luxuries not essentials Air travel has also largely escaped carbon pricing which covers a quarter of all emissions Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChange is in the air however Since the start of last year a un-backed scheme has required airlines to offset emissions above a baseline by buying credits On December 6th the eu decided to bring airlines deeper into its carbon-trading scheme These are steps in the right direction even if they are unlikely to bring about fast enough decarbonisation for Europe to hit its goal of a net-zero aviation industry by 2050The ideal carbon-pricing scheme would apply across the economy allowing trade-offs to be made between different activities If society decided that flying was especially important there would be fewer permits for steelmaking The price of carbon would reflect both the ease of substituting a less polluting energy source and the value of the activity it fuels The faulty logic behind excluding airlines from the eu scheme was that there was not yet a viable alternative for jet fuel It was thought a carbon price on flights would simply annoy flyers and push airlines elsewhere But there are ways of reducing the carbon intensity of a flight More efficient aircraft help as does smarter pricing to ensure every seat is used Even without a carbon price the carbon intensity of a passenger kilometre has fallen from around 14kg of carbon dioxide in 1960 to 01kg in 2018 Carbon prices can also change the behaviour of consumers encouraging them to opt for a train bus or boat where available Handing out free permits to airlines amounted to an implicit subsidy for flying The eu new plan will see airlines lose more of these permits each year until the industry special carbon allowances are phased out entirely in 2026 a year sooner than had been intended Britain and Switzerland are included but flights to other countries outside the bloc will remain exempt This is mostly the result of a spat in 2012 when China threatened to stop buying planes from Airbus a European firm and America threatened non-compliance if the eu required all flights to take partInternational airlines will still have to hew to the un-backed scheme which is known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation corsia and applies to the whole industry Under corsia an airline must offset emissions beyond a baseline by buying credits with the split based on the airline share of total industry emissions For the pilot stage which runs until the end of 2023 the baseline is industry emissions in 2019 As airlines have not fully recovered from the covid-19 pandemic there is currently no requirement to offset emissions From 2024 the baseline will be lowered to 85% of emissions in 2019 Yet even this will not have much impact Credits are cheap costing about $3 a tonne compared with around €90 $96 a tonne in the eu And airlines may be able to avoid buying them at all by using a bit of sustainable aviation fuel made from waste cooking oil which is heavily subsidised in America So far nowhere has opted for a carbon-pricing scheme that operates across the whole economy By incorporating airlines into its carbon-trading scheme Europe is at least heading in the right direction But with the scheme limitations and with the rest of the world lagging behind the journey to a net-zero aviation industry will be a slow one For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 15th 2022,The insidious threats to central-bank independence,“Just kick ’em up the rump a little” That was how President Richard Nixon advised Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns to persuade the rest of the Fed board to cut interest rates in 1971 Kicked or not the central bankers complied Cuts helped Nixon to re-election by boosting employment They also contributed to double-digit inflation that would not be decisively tamed until Paul Volcker ran the Fed in the 1980s Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn December 14th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 05 percentage points; the European Central Bank ecb and the Bank of England were expected to follow suit shortly after The Economist weekly edition was published Technocrats have spent the decades since Burns making Nixon-like meddling more difficult An academic cottage industry is devoted to numerating and ranking central bankers’ independence In 2020 there were more than 150 central banks classed as independent by the Bank of England countsome 90 more than in the 1970s The ecb autonomy is guaranteed by treaty When President Donald Trump criticised Jerome Powell the present Fed chair for raising rates in 2018 the president appeared both backward and impotent This year President Joe Biden has emphasised his support for the Fed Some British politicians in the governing Conservative Party even argue that the Bank of England has not raised rates enoughThe notion that today central bankers might be bullied into stopping the fight against inflation is therefore harder to sustain Yet it would be a mistake to suggest that monetary policy is completely insulated from politics For there are forces threatening central bankers’ independence in new and insidious ways The first is that central banks are less hard-nosed and keener to play to the gallery than they were In the Volcker era economists speculated that independent central bankers might work best if they were more hawkish than society about inflation Over time they came to reject “inflation nutters” in favour of “flexible” inflation targeting which took employment into account too By 2020 central bankers looked jobs-nuts The Fed said it would not raise rates at all until the labour market was tight an approach which left it hopelessly adrift as inflation took off Its top brass had been on a “Fed listens” tour at which the public having not been seriously troubled by inflation for decades told central bankers that stimulating employment should be their priority Advocates for making central bankers directly accountable forget that politicians’ desire to distort monetary policy comes from listening to what voters want Central bankers need independence from the public as much as they do from their elected representatives But they spend ever more time in press conferences and giving speeches At the moment Mr Powell and his peers use their public profile to speak hard truths about how long-term price stability is the foundation of prosperity But their resolve is yet to be tested by a recession which could provoke a backlash like the one Volcker had to see off Only after such a backlash will it be clear whether central bankers see their job as to lead or to listenThe second threat stems from the new tool central bankers have deployed since the global financial crisis of 2007-09: quantitative easing or the purchase of government bonds with newly created money Over the past decade central bankers have become an important force in bond markets as they have attempted to keep long-term interest rates low They have also intermittently solved financial crises by becoming “market-makers of last resort” buying bonds to restore calma job that has become more important owing to the rise of financial intermediaries outside the traditional banking system Central-bank balance-sheets have grown much faster during crises than they have shrunk during tightening episodes At today pace of quantitative tightening qt for example it would take ten years for the Bank of England balance-sheet to return to its size before the financial crisis As central bankers’ footprints in markets grow in size they find themselves making more decisions that are ultimately political in nature The ecb balance-sheet has become the conduit for a de facto mutualisation of some of Italy debts The central bank has not yet started qt but it has unveiled another bond-market “tool” to backstop indebted countries The Fed faced allegations that its support for corporate-debt markets during the covid-19 pandemic favoured bigger firms over smaller ones dependent on bank lending A large proportion of the rise in Britain debt-service costs this year has flowed via the Bank of England which must pay interest on the reserves it has issued to conduct qe Mission creep has put a target on central bankers’ backs Some would like central banks to do even more by deploying their balance-sheets in pursuit of a broad array of goals including subsidising the fight against climate changeTake it to the graveThe final threat stems from government spending Economists’ models say that the ability of central banks to control inflation depends on sound public finances which Eric Leeper of the University of Virginia has called the profession “dirty little secret” Should governments borrow without restraint they undermine the credibility of monetary policy without so much as a phone call to the technocrats who set interest rates All it takes to produce self-fulfilling expectations of inflation is a belief that the government will one day choose to inflate away some of its debts Central bankers should thus look nervously at the increasing tendency of governments to borrow and spend for example on vast energy subsidies as in Europe They should also fear the intense pressure on budgets that is forecast for the coming decades as ageing populations push up spending on health care and pensions Politicians today are very different from

 Dec 13th 2022,The game is up for Sam Bankman-Fried,Only a month has elapsed since Sam Bankman-Fried the founder of ftx a crypto exchange placed the firm along with Alameda Research its sister hedge fund into bankruptcy proceedings The exchange was unable to meet customers’ withdrawal requests; the problem it became clear was that some $8bn of customer assets had ended up in the custody of Alameda and were missing In the intervening days Mr Bankman-Fried has given countless interviews in which he has apologised appeared confused by the unravelling of his empire pleaded ignorance and generally tried to shift the blameListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHe told “Good Morning America” that he “failed to have proper oversight” In an interview with New York magazine he said: “I fucked up I did In multiple ways frankly” He explained to the New York Times that there were mysterious discrepancies between what “the audited financials were the true financials what the exchange understood” and said to the Wall Street Journal that he could not account for the missing money: “I wasn’t running Alameda”Mr Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 12th at the request of the American government The next day he was denied bail; he is expected to be extradited shortly The indictment charges Mr Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts including wire fraud against customers lenders and investors as well as conspiracies to commit money-laundering and commodities and securities fraud For good measure he is accused of defrauding the United States by violating campaign-finance laws The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission two regulators have also filed complaints Some of the facts in the filings are familiar to those who have been listening to Mr Bankman-Fried missives He has admitted he told customers to route their funds to Alameda bank accounthe suggested this was because ftx had not set up accounts and that the funds were lost because of sloppy accounting The sec complaint argues Alameda used the funds to make investments buy lavish properties and offer political donations and that this use of them means Mr Bankman-Fried was “orchestrating a massive years-long fraud”Mr Bankman-Fried has said he was unaware of what the hedge fund did with the cash The complaint alleges he was in fact well aware and that he set up ways for Alameda to borrow customers’ funds On multiple occasions the sec writes he “directed ftx to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance” giving it an unofficial credit line to take customer funds The sec complaint also alleges that Mr Bankman-Fried made Alameda exempt from the processes by which customers’ trading positions were liquidated when markets moved against themIn May as crypto markets crashed despite having “already taken billions of dollars of ftx customer assets” when Alameda could not meet loan obligations the sec alleges that Mr Bankman-Fried “directed ftx to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda” Most galling perhaps is the allegation that “even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and ftx could not make customers whole” Mr Bankman-Fried continued to make venture investments and took out personal “loans” from Alameda for himself and other ftx higher-ups The sum of these actions the sec argues is that there was no real distinction between Alameda and ftx and that Mr Bankman-Fried used the hedge fund as his “personal piggy bank” without disclosing this to investors or customers In a congressional hearing on December 13th John Ray III appointed boss of ftx by Mr Bankman-Fried before the firm filed for bankruptcy summarised it in a similar manner: “This is really old-fashioned embezzlement This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose”Mr Bankman-Fried denies any illegal activity and has sought in interviews to distance himself from criminal wrongdoing If he were successfully convicted the former ftx boss might spend the rest of his life behind bars When Bernard Madoff a notorious financier who ran a Ponzi scheme was sentenced in 2009 the judge noted that: “The fraud loss known to date which is greater than $13bn is more than 32 times the baseline level of loss that would carry a sentence of life under the us Sentencing Guidelines” The judge recommended that Madoff should serve 150 years The authorities put the cost of Mr Bankman-Fried alleged fraud at $8bnMr Bankman-Fried seems in denial about the situation He could not attend the congressional hearing as he was in custody but his intended testimony leaked In it he claims he was manipulated into filing for bankruptcy by his general counsel that the team in charge are mismanaging the process and that Alameda and ftx troubles only really began when the boss of a rival exchange tweeted he would sell ftx tokens Mr Bankman-Fried insists the firms could have raised capital and made customers whole When he put this to Ryne Miller his general counsel Mr Miller replied with an answer clear seemingly to everyone but Mr Bankman-Fried “There nothing to save Sam” To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology sign up to the Bottom Line our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 13th 2022,America inflation fever may be breaking at last,“We will stay the course until the job is done” said Jerome Powell the Federal Reserve chairman on December 14th shortly after the central bank latest interest-rate rise As a statement of intent his words were both straightforward and utterly sensible But what it means for the job to be done is becoming a matter of controversy Inflation remains uncomfortably high Meanwhile the aggressive monetary tightening of the past year is only now filtering through to the economy complicating assessments of whether the Fed has in fact done enough to rein in prices Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPromisingly after a difficult two years inflation does appear to be easing its grip on the American economy Overall prices increased by a mere 01% month-on-month in November according to data published on December 13th making for that rarest of recent occurrences: a downside surprise Most encouraging was a breakdown showing that core inflation which strips out volatile food and energy costs had decelerated for a second consecutive month see chartInvestors and analysts scarred by America relentless run of inflation have learned to restrain their hopes after a single month of rosy data Year-on-year rates of inflation remain elevated at 71% for headline inflation But the disinflation in November follows a similarly cheerful batch of data for October Optimism is on the rise albeit still mostly of the cautious rather than the unbridled kind Since mid-October the s&p 500 index of leading American firms has recovered some of the ground it lost earlier this year Concerns are shifting to the prospect of weaker growth Many economists forecast a recession early next year For the Fed these countervailing forces create a tricky balance On the one hand it has just administered the sharpest tightening of monetary policy in four decades lifting interest rates from a floor of 0% in March to more than 4% today With inflation ebbing it is prudent to slow the pace of rate increases On the other hand a perception of Fed softening risks adding fuel to the market rally That in turn would cause financial conditions to ease thereby placing upward pressure on inflationThe Fed has tried to resolve this conundrum by maintaining its hawkish tone at the same time as tweaking its policies On December 14th the Fed raised rates by half a percentage point ending a string of jumbo three-quarter-point increases Most Fed officials believe that they will raise rates to more than 5% next year and refrain from cutting rates until 2024 according to the central bank latest projections “Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely easing” said Mr PowellStrikingly many investors think the Fed will end up being more dovish Bond pricing suggests that rates will peak at less than 5% and that the central bank will start cutting them before the end of 2023Ultimately the decision will come down to the data Prices of consumer goods have started falling as pandemic-era shortages melt away Housing prices are also trending lower The big lingering concern is whether a tight labour market will push incomes and by extension prices higher Investors are betting that wage increases will slow as the economy weakens The Fed understandably is not popping the champagne just yet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 11th 2022,How the West fell out of love with economic growth,This year has been a good one for the West The alliance has surprised observers with its united front against Russian aggression As authoritarian China suffers one of its weakest periods of growth since Chairman Mao the American economy roars along A wave of populism across rich countries which began in 2016 with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump looks as if it may have crested Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet away from the world attention rich democracies face a profound slow-burning problem: weak economic growth In the year before covid-19 advanced economies’ gdp grew by less than 2% High-frequency measures suggest that rich-world productivity the ultimate source of improved living standards is at best stagnant and may be declining Official forecasts suggest that by 2027 per-person gdp growth in the median rich country will be less than 15% a year Some places such as Canada and Switzerland will see numbers closer to zero Perhaps rich countries are destined for weak growth Many have fast-ageing populations Once labour markets are opened to women and university education democratised important sources of growth are exhausted Much low-hanging technological fruit such as proper sanitation cars and the internet has been plucked This growth problem is surmountable however Policymakers could make it easier to trade across borders giving globalisation a boost They could reform planning to make it possible to build reducing outrageous housing costs They could welcome migrants to replace retiring workers All these reforms would raise the growth rate Unfortunately economic growth has fallen out of fashion According to our analysis of data from the Manifesto Project which collects information on the manifestos of political parties over decades those in the oecd a group of mostly rich countries are about half as focused on growth as they were in the 1980s see chart 1 Modern politicians are less likely to extol the benefits of free markets than their predecessors for instance They are more likely to express anti-growth sentiments such as positive mentions of government control over the economy When they do talk about growth politicians tend to do so in an unsophisticated manner In 1994 a reference by Gordon Brown Britain shadow chancellor to “post neo-classical endogenous growth theory” was mocked but it at least indicated serious engagement with the issue Politicians such as Lyndon Johnson Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan offered policies based on a coherent theory of the relationship between the individual and the state gdp small coterie of modern champions such as Mr Trump and Liz Truss offer little more than reheated ReaganismApathy towards growth is not merely rhetorical Britain hints at a wider loss of zeal In the 1970s the average budget contained tax reforms worth 2% of gdp By the late 2010s policies made half as much impact A paper published in 2020 by the late Alberto Alesina an economist at Harvard University and colleagues at the imf and Georgetown University measured the significance of structural reforms such as changes to regulations over time In the 1980s and 1990s politicians in advanced economies implemented a large number making their economies sleeker By the 2010s however they had lost their oomph: reforms practically ground to a halt Our analysis of data from the World Bank suggests that progress has slowed still further in recent years and may even have reversed see chart 2 The American government introduced 12000 new regulations in 2021 a rise on recent years From 2010 to 2020 rich countries’ tariff restrictions on imports doubled Britain voted for and implemented Brexit Other countries have turned against immigration In 2007 almost 6m people on net migrated to advanced economies In 2019 the number was down to just 4mGovernments have also become less friendly to new construction whether of housing or infrastructure A paper by Knut Are Aastveit Bruno Albuquerque and André Anundsen three economists finds American housing “supply elasticities” the extent to which construction responds to higher demandhave fallen since the housing boom of the 2000s This is likely to reflect tougher land-use policies and more powerful nimbys Housing construction across the rich world is about two-thirds its level in that decade see chart 3 Politicians prefer splurging the proceeds of what growth exists Governments are spending a lot more on welfare such as pensions and in particular health care In 1979 the bottom fifth of American earners received means-tested transfers worth less than a third of their pre-tax income according to the Congressional Budget Office By 2018 the figure was more than two-thirds According to a report in 2019 health spending per person in the oecd will grow at an average annual rate of 3% and reach 10% of gdp by 2030 up from 9% in 2018 Politics is increasingly an arms race with promises of more money for health care and social protection “Thirty or 40 years ago it was taken for granted that the elderly were not good candidates for organ transplantation dialysis or advanced surgical procedures” writes Daniel Callahan an ethicist “That has changed” Greater wealth has enabled this Yet politicians rarely ask whether an extra dollar on health care is the best use of cash Britons in their 90s receive health and social care that costs the country about £15000 $17000 a year about half Britain gdp per person Must budgets rise year after year to meet growing demand even as the price of providing that care is also likely to increase? If yes where is the limit? People may see spending on health care and pensions as self-evidently good But it comes with downsides More people work in an area where productivity gains and therefore improvements in overall living standards are hard to induce Perfectly fit older people drop out of work to receive a pension Funding this requires higher taxes or cuts elsewhere Since the early 1980s government spending across the oecd on research and development as a share of gdp has fallen by about a third Much of the extra spending comes at times of crisis Politicians are increasingly concerned with preventing bad things from happening to people or compensating them when they do The enormous system of credit guarantees eviction moratoriums and debt forgiveness introduced during the pandemic brought bankruptcies and defaults to a halt This was radical but also the thin end of the wedge In America for instance the federal government has assumed huge contingent liabilities It guarantees an ever-larger quantity of people bank deposits; it forgives student loans; it offers a wide variety of implicit and explicit backstops to everything from airports to highways We have previously estimated that Uncle Sam is on the hook for liabilities worth more than six times America gdp This year European governments have fallen over themselves to offer financial support to households and firms during the continent energy crisis Even Germany normally Europe most disciplined spender has allocated funding worth 7% of gdp for this purposeNo one cheers when a company goes bankrupt or someone falls into poverty But the bail-out state makes economies less adaptable ultimately constraining growth by preventing resources shifting from unproductive to productive uses Already there is evidence that fiscal help doled out during the pandemic has created more “zombie” firmsthose which are going concerns but which create little economic value The huge implicit liabilities of governments also mean higher spending in times of trouble which reinforces the trend towards higher taxation Why has the West turned away from growth? One possible answer relates to ageing populations People who are not working or are near the end of their working lives tend to be less interested in getting richer They will support things which directly benefit them such as health-care spending but oppose those that produce benefits only after they have gone such as immigration or house-building Their turnout at elections tends to be high so their views carry weight Yet Western populations have been ageing for decades including during the reformist 1980s and 1990s Therefore the change in the environment in which policy is made may play a role Before social media and 24-hour rolling news it was easier to implement difficult reforms The losers from a policya business exposed to greater competition from abroad sayoften had little choice but to suffer in silence In 1936 Franklin Roosevelt speaking about opponents to his New Deal felt comfortable enough to “welcome” his opponents’ hatred Now the aggrieved have more ways to complain As a result policymakers have greater incentive to limit the number of people who lose out resulting in what Ben Ansell of Oxford University calls “countrywide decision by committee” High levels of debt have also constrained policymakers’ room for manoeuvre Across the g7 group of rich powerful countries private debt has risen by the equivalent of 30 percentage points of gdp since 2000 Even small declines in cash flows could make servicing the debt harder This means politicians quickly intervene when anything goes wrong Their focus is keeping the show on the roadavoiding a repeat of the global financial crisis of 2007-09rather than accepting pain today as the price of a brighter future Quite what would push the West in a new direction is unclear There is no sign of a shift just yet beyond the misguided attempts of Mr Trump and Ms Truss Would another financial crisis do the job? Will a change have to wait until the baby-boomers are no longer around? Whatever the answer until growth speeds up Western policymakers must hope their enemies continue to blunder For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 8th 2022,Tackling sexual harassment could bring sizeable economic dividends,Five years after the MeToo movement gripped the world the problem of sexual harassment continues to dog the economics profession Fresh allegations of misconduct at universities in America and Europe are causing a torrent of older cases to emerge Rooting out harassment in academia is particularly hard because career progression depends on the goodwill of not just senior colleagues but also peers at far-flung institutions who often partner with juniors to conduct research and who review papers vying to get published in prestigious journals Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet half a decade has not gone by in vain Many economists are now using the same rigorous approach they bring to assessing the labour market or the impact of workplace accidents to gauge the effects of harassment Their findings help give a sense of the costto victims and the wider workforceof sexual coercion demeaning treatment and degrading comments Fortunately the research also shows that some remedies do work making the pay-off to halting misconduct both sizeable and attainable The greatest cost of harassment is borne by the victims themselves On top of the grave psychological costs there are economic ones too Victims tend to give up their jobs to look for new ones for which they may be less suited Johanna Rickne of Stockholm University and Olle Folke of Uppsala University conducted a survey on sexual harassment and followed respondents for five years They found that women who reported harassment were 25% likelier to leave their job than other women; the equivalent increase for male victims was 15% The women who left also tended to earn less Another study by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University and colleagues using Finnish data on violent incidents including sexual assault shows that female victims have almost as much chance of being durably unemployed as workers laid off after the closure of a plant; for male victims the likelihood is a little lower The fear of being unemployed also appears to deter victims of sexual harassment from speaking up Gordon Dahl of the University of California San Diego and Matthew Knepper of the University of Georgia find that only the more egregious cases tend to be reported during recessionsGender-based harassment also acts as a tax on the rest of the population One way to pin an economic value on this is to estimate how much of a pay cut workers are ready to accept to avoid the risk of harassment In their paper Ms Rickne and Mr Folke ran experiments with hypothetical job offers in Sweden They find that on average the gender most at riskmost often womenis willing to give up 17% of their salaries to avoid harassment In another study Joni Hersch of Vanderbilt University calculates that the collective sacrifice in earnings of American women per filed case of sexual harassment in any given year is $93m Encouragingly research can also guide thinking on how to tackle sexual harassment One lesson is that improving outside options can help Mr Dahl and Mr Knepper find that before North Carolina cut unemployment benefits in 2013 workers were more likely to report harassment Amenities that make it easier to find work such as transport links to thriving job basins should also make a difference Where the potential for retaliation is high and outside options are limited such as in film-making or academia field-wide institutions must be strong enough to punish deviations The American Economic Association has written codes of conduct and can open investigations but lacks the teeth to obtain evidence and impose sanctions Another lesson is that employers themselves should have a strong interest in tackling sexual harassment Caroline Coly of Bocconi University and co-authors find that since 2017 women have been leaving organisations where they fear being harassed in higher numbers The Finnish study also finds that women other than the victim tend to leave a firm where male violence towards women has been reported The corollary is that firms that clamp down on harassers should be able to access a wider pool of talent thereby allowing them to outperform competitorsEvidence of such a bonus is starting to emerge Research suggests firms run by female executives may have become more valuable since MeToo began One reason could be that they tackle male wrongdoers differently Ms Adams-Prassl and colleagues find that female leaders tend to sack perpetrators That in turn prompts more women to stay A paper by Mark Egan of Harvard Business School and colleagues also shows that female bosses are less tolerant of other types of misconduct by men such as consumer disputes or regulatory offencesPaying the priceSuch incentives however can go only so far The final lesson is that organisations under whose roofs harassment occurs often bear too little of the true cost America federal laws cap the sexual-harassment damages a victim can receive from large firms at $300000 Applying the same method used in workplace-safety cases Ms Hersch argues yields a larger amount: $93m the earnings sacrifice women are willing to make to avoid harassment Such payments could deter firms from tolerating misconduct But they may not be enough to change norms and corporate culture For that to happen people in power need to speak outEconomists now need to turn their focus to their own backyard Anna a former economics phd student at a European university whose name we have changed recounts how her supervisor made inappropriate comments and eventually asked her to spend the night at his placewhich she declinedbefore turning vindictive when she requested a change of supervisor After her PhD Anna chose to pursue a career outside academia Not for a lack of ambition she says but to avoid the toxic culture and the unsafe environment it breeds Economics would do well to make sure future Annas decide to stay Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation Dec 1stWeather is again determining economic outcomes Nov 24thOnly a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 8th 2022,Europe and America put a brave face on a growing economic rift,A useful contrarian indicator for gauging the substance of international talks is whether negotiators talk about concrete The more they do the less they tend to achieve The Trade and Technology Council TTC a forum for the EU and America to co-ordinate regulation appears to prove this admittedly cynical rule At its latest meeting on December 5th the White House said it had advanced “concrete action” on transatlantic co-operation by launching new “concrete initiatives” while a joint statement with the Europeans promised yet more “concrete outcomes” and “concrete actions” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe trouble is despite all the talk of concreteness America and Europe now have major disagreements in the economic realm and few obvious solutions The main point of contention is the Inflation Reduction Act the centrepiece of the Democrats’ climate-and-industrial strategy The IRA signed into law in August features nearly $400bn in funding for energy-related projects much of which is contingent on goods being produced in or near America There are subsidies for automakers who buy locally made batteries tax credits for domestic producers of renewable fuels and tax breaks for consumers who buy electric vehicles that contain enough North American componentsThe Biden administration believes these incentives are needed to spur the development of America green economy In industries such as electric vehicles America is a laggard see chart The worry in Europe and Asia is that America giant market and generous handouts will attract their companies at the expense of their home bases In the past year alone international carmakers from BMW and Toyota to Mercedes and Stellantis have announced big investments in America The fallout from Russia invasion of Ukraine adds to the aggravation: a shift away from Russian energy supplies has raised costs in Europe further harming its industriesEurope displeasure was made clear on the eve of the meetings in Washington DC Emmanuel Macron France president called America subsidies a “killer for our industry” in an interview with CBS “60 Minutes” show Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission the bloc executive arm spoke of distortions caused by the American law A single TTC meeting was never going to heal the rift The forum packed into one day talks on risk management in artificial intelligence standards for plastics recycling warning systems for semiconductor supply-chain disruptions and more And yet Valdis Dombrovskis the European commissioner for trade said he left the TTC feeling “slightly more optimistic” about co-operation with America That optimism follows on from President Joe Biden pledge that America could tweak its subsidies to satisfy European companiesWarm words aside what can America do to help? Its climate tax credits enshrined as law cannot be easily modified There is no chance of new legislation during the next two years of divided Congress Instead the response is likely to come from Europe where officials are mulling their own green incentives The most concrete outcome of the TTC may thus be the continued drift of America and Europe towards a full-fledged subsidy race For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 7th 2022,Inflation is fallingbut not enough,Before the pandemic the idea of an annual rate of inflation of 10% in the euro zone would have seemed like a horror story In November it was good news Inflation had been 106% the month before A similar surprise came from America As inflation falls so does the expected pace of interest-rate increases On December 14th and 15th the Federal Reserve European Central Bank and Bank of England will each probably raise rates by half a percentage pointa deceleration from the three-quarter-point rises that have recently prevailed Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGlobally inflation has begun to decline primarily because energy prices have eased since the summer and because supply chains long gummed up by the pandemic are operating more smoothly Yet inflation remains a very long way from central banks’ 2% targets There are three reasons to think rate-setters will struggle to hit their goals soonThe first is a continued scarcity of workers While the news on prices has been good the latest wage data are worrying In America average hourly earnings had shown encouraging signs of softening since August But updated figures released on December 2nd upended the picture showing annualised growth of 51% over the past three months roughly in line with other surveys Since the data came out stockmarkets in America have fallen in expectation of prolonged interest-rate rises In Britain wages are growing at a similar rate; a wave of strikes may prompt still bigger increases The euro zone labour markets though not as sizzling are hot enough to make policymakers worry that energy inflation could affect the rest of the economy as workers bargain for higher wages to offset rising living costs The second problem is fiscal policy It would help central banks to cool labour markets if governments shrank their budget deficits Yet America recent Inflation Reduction Act makes only a minimal dent in government borrowing and the Biden administration is trying to forgive swathes of student debt Europe is splurging on energy subsidies despite warnings from the IMF and others that it is unwise to stimulate economies which lack spare productive capacitya mistake America made in 2021 when President Joe Biden “American Rescue Plan” overheated the economy If the EU retains its measures throughout 2023 the cost net of taxes raised to fund the handouts will reach nearly 2% of GDP see chart In aggregate Britain much advertised belt-tightening will not begin until 2025 thanks to its costly energy-price cap Nearly two-thirds of the EU energy spending is on controlling prices for everyone which is expensive and discourages energy saving Only a fifth comes in the form of targeted redistribution to the needy the approach recommended by the likes of the IMF Even Germany which has capped prices only up to 80% of a household previous usage is still borrowing to fund the scheme meaning that it will deliver an economic stimulus The final danger is that energy inflation returns in 2023 This year Europe economies have benefited from weak competition for scarce supplies of global liquefied natural gas LNG in part because China economy has been hampered by its zero-covid policy But China has begun to loosen its pandemic controls If its economy reopens and rebounds LNG prices could surge in 2023 Central bankers’ battle with inflation has reached an inflection point But it will not be won for a long time For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 5th 2022,Can you afford to retire?,Can you afford to retire? The answer is much more likely to be no today than it was a year agoespecially for those old enough to ask themselves the question The resurgence of inflation is eroding the real value of savings Higher interest rates have caused a repricing of bonds and stocks The result is that the pot of assets many future pensioners are hoping to live off has shrunk fast Pundits have long predicted that as populations age and the number of workers for every dependent falls those retirement savings would come under pressurea problem they have dubbed the “pension time-bomb” The fuse now looks much shorter Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe soon-to-be retired are often advised to shift their assets into bonds and out of stocks as they prepare to stop working to protect their savings from big stockmarket corrections So-called “life-cycle” pension funds are usually invested almost entirely in stocks during their owners’ younger years a strategy meant to capture the higher returns that listed equities tend to generate over long periods As workers near retirement these funds usually swap most of their equities for government bonds which are supposed to hold their value But with less than a month to go 2022 looks set to be an appalling year for bonds The typical portfolio of those closest to hanging up their boots has lost 17% of its value since January A year ago a 65-year-old who had saved a healthy $25m for their retirement and invested 80% of it in government bonds and 20% in stocks globally would have typically drawn an income of $100000 If inflation stayed modest they would have been able to draw a similar real income for the next 30 years The asset-price crash however means that the value of the pot has fallen to around $21mallowing them to draw nominal annual payments of just $83000 Soaring inflation meanwhile has eaten up another 10% of that income leaving them with just $75000 in real terms And the shrinkage is hardly over Should inflation remain above 2% for a whilesay it averages 3% a year insteadthen a retiree who made it to 90 might well be living on just 65% of the real income they might have expected until recentlyThis impoverishment could fast become reality for millions A lot of baby-boomers turned into pension-boomers in 2021 The Federal Reserve Board of St Louis reckons there were 33m more retired people in October 2021 in America than 20 months before More than half of Americans over 55 have left the labour force up from 48% in the third quarter of 2019 according to the Pew Research Centre a think-tank in Washington DC This reverses a decades-long increase in the share of people working past 55 which has slid back to the levels of 2007-09 in just a year A similar pattern is evident across the OECD club of mostly rich countriesSurvey data already suggest some of those who recently retired are considering returning to work Those who do not or cannot probably face leaner years than they had expected But individuals are not the only ones who will bear the burden of the adjustment Some of it will also be shouldered by governments through social-security and national-insurance schemes And part of it will be borne by a creature that is becoming ever rarer: the defined-benefit DB pension plan Many of those considering retirement today spent much of their lives working during the golden age of DB schemes when firms or employers in the public sector such as schools and local governments agreed to pay workers an annuity after they stopped working Of the $40trn held in retirement assets in America today $17trn is held in such schemesA typical DB payout is worth 2% of a worker final salary multiplied by years of service So a teacher employed for say 40 years who retired when her salary was $80000 would be paid $64000 per year for the rest of her life In this way the employer shouldered all the investment risk the individual would otherwise have to face; DB schemes not their members are the ones bearing the mighty losses in asset prices this year Some plans also adjust payouts for inflation Over recent decades ageing populations and rising life expectancies have together pulled down interest rates; bigger savings pools chasing a finite volume of assets meant capital became cheaper It gradually became clear to firms and public-sector agencies just how hard keeping their pension promises was going to be From the 1980s the private sector therefore began to phase out its offerings of such plans: the share of employees enrolled in DB schemes in America dropped from nearly two-fifths at its peak to just a fifth by 2008 Then the strain of the financial crisis prompted many firms to reclassify DB plans as defined-contribution schemes where workers simply contribute a set amount to the pot with no guarantee of what they get back after retirement Public-sector employers have had much less success in reducing their exposure to these overgenerous pension schemes however The result is that around $13trn of America DB assets are managed by state local and federal governments Many of the biggest DB schemes and some of the biggest pension funds in existence today are run by public institutions such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System CalPERS and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan OTPP and have assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars The portfolios of many schemes are suffering just as many more of their members are getting ready to ask for their moneyThe way to measure how easily a pension plan will meet its liabilities in the future is to look at its “funded ratio” This compares the pot of investments it currently holds against the expected future value of the promises it has made to those paying in The sum has three moving parts: the value of the current investment pot the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payouts and the stream of those expected future payments The third factor is the hardest to figure out because future payouts are based on undetermined final salaries and on how long the recipient and their spouse who is often eligible for payments might live Olivia Mitchell a professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania points out that the income stream a DB pension scheme might owe to someone joining the plan today could stretch more than a century into the future if you include payments made to partners Still it is the other two elementsthe value of the investment pot and the discount ratethat decide whether funded ratios soar or sink The easiest way to run a pension is to match assets with liabilities by buying long-term bonds that pay out when pensioners come knocking If yields on American government bonds are the benchmark say then the pension manager might simply buy lumps of them Should the value of those assets plunge the pension plan would still be able to meet its expected future liabilities: it would only have to hold the bonds to maturity and distribute the yield it was promised when it bought them That strategy only works though if the plan is “fully funded”: that is if the cash it has to begin with is worth 100% of its expected liabilities If it is underfundedperhaps because contributions are not high enough or because it made some poor investments in the pastthen putting all of its assets into the investments that earn the discount rate on its liabilities will set a fund up for bankruptcy down the road Many underfunded pensions have had to take risksby holding equities for examplein a bid to fill their funding gaps A combination of bad investment years such as 2001 or 2008 falling discount rates ageing populations and the political infeasibility of asking employees to contribute more has pushed a lot of DB schemes into the red in recent years In isolation falls in the value of the pot are bad But although higher interest rates hurt asset values they can also be helpful for pension schemes because they reduce the present value of future payouts This year has therefore not been a bad one for all pension plans Indeed corporate pensions in America have done rather well After a bumper 2021 the average corporate pot was fully funded at the end of the year for the first time since 2007 Corporate funds then moved to reduce their investment risk early by swapping many stocks for bondsan asset-allocation shift so huge and rapid that it may have contributed to the end of America stockmarket rally at the start of this year Corporate plans elsewhere have not been so lucky if only because their stockmarkets did not do as well to start with Many British corporate plans for example are still underfunded In recent years that has led them to adopt strategies in a bid to protect themselves against falling interest rates; one called “liability-driven investing” ldi nearly blew them up over the summer To ensure they did not look more underfunded when rates fell many British funds loaded up on derivatives that would pay out when rates dipped but required them to cough up cash when they rose As rates rocketed many funds faced margin calls so big that they threatened to absorb all the cash the funds had to hand Only when the Bank of England intervened did the danger of bankruptcy ebb The big losers of 2022 though are public pensions Whereas over the past 12 months the average funding ratio for a private plan has risen from 97% to around 110% that of public pensions in America which stood at 86% a year ago their highest since the financial crisis has dropped to 69%close to a four-year low There are two main reasons for the slump One is that the discount rates used by public plans rather than being benchmarked to a given asset market are instead set by external committees The trouble is that these committees did not reduce discount rates by as much as interest rates fell over the decade that followed the financial crisis which made it difficult to raise them by much this year as interest rates rose again This means the liabilities those pension funds must face in the future remain nearly as high as before At the same time funds’ investments have performed poorly As yields on bonds fell across the developed world in the 2010s many underfunded plans moved into riskier investments such as leveraged loans private equity venture investing and even cryptocurrencies OTPP held a stake in FTX a crypto exchange once valued at $32bn that went spectacularly bust last month Funding ratios can dip only so far before pension funds get into serious trouble “Once a plan is only 40% funded” grimaces Mike Rosborough a former portfolio manager at CalPERS now at AllianceBernstein a research firm “there is often no going back” It becomes almost impossible at those kinds of levels for the pension plan to pay out the annual liabilities it owes to those who have already retired from the income it makes on its assets It is instead forced to sell those assets off This quickly becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle: the more assets it has to sell the smaller the pot and the more underfunded it becomes This can go on until the assets hit zeroat which point the plan becomes “pay as you go”: it uses the contributions of current payers to pay former workers or is bailed out by taxpayers This may never become a problem for CalPERS California is a rich state which has been directing extra funding to its pension plans from its budget surplus for years But it is becoming a scary possibility in American states like Kentucky Illinois Connecticut and New Jersey where public pensions are around just half-fundedEven with all their problems pensioners that depend on underfunded public DB plans are miles better off than those relying on Social Security the American equivalent of National Insurance Transfers are mostly paid using contributions from current workers That first started to look shaky in 2008 when withdrawals exceeded contributions for the first time Payments have since been partly financed from a trust based on past surplus contributions But the excess of withdrawals over contributions means that this trust is projected to run out in 2035 after which the state will have to make up the difference The fate of many db and social-security pensioners alike could ultimately depend on the government willingness to bail them out For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterClarification December 12th 2022: This story has been amended to make clear that some DB schemes are suffering but not all

 Dec 1st 2022,A playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation,Across the rich world consumer prices are rising by 10% year on year the highest rate since 1983 That year holds a special place in the history books It was the final year after many in which annual inflation was in double figures Thereafter it moved downwards paving the way for the low inflation of the 1990sListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday central bankers hope to repeat the trick and thus enter monetary policy hall of fame alongside the giants of the 1980s Paul Volcker who led the Federal Reserve from 1979-87 is the biggest giant of all But Gerald Bouey in Canada Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in Italy and Karl Otto Pöhl in Germanywho memorably compared inflation to toothpaste “once it out you can hardly get it back in again”also presided over disinflation in that decade Central bankers hope their job will not be too hard The Fed projections suggest that by 2024 inflation will be close to target at the price of just a small rise in unemployment The current period of high inflation is relatively short so the hope is that expectations of price pressure are not entrenched Others say that price rises are in large part driven by supply-side disruptions which should soon fade Yet over time the inflationary surge appears to be broadening almost everywhere In many places expectations are starting to look stubbornly high So the experience of the 1980s may become instructive And once you dig into the history the decade holds three tough lessons for today policymakers First inflation can take a long time to come down Second defeating inflation requires the participation not just of central bankers but other policymakers too And third it will come with huge trade-offs The question is whether today policymakers can navigate these challenges Take the path of disinflation first In the 1980s it was a slog Italy saw success faster than most Under Ciampi the central bank moved from the treasury plaything to a quasi-independent institution: inflation fell from 22% in 1980 to 4% by 1986 But that still meant five long years where prices rose by more than 10% Even if the rich world today reduces inflation as fast as Italy did its average inflation rate would not come down to 2% before late 2025In any case most countries had more trouble than Italy In 1980-81 rich-world inflation fell but progress came to a halt in 1982-83 Then in 1987-88 there was another inflationary spike fuelled by energy costs In some countries inflation jumped around In early 1984 with inflation at 35% New Zealand wonks thought they had slain the monster By mid-1985 however it exceeded 16% We estimate that in only 53% of months in the 1980s did inflation in the average rich country decline relative to the previous month Disinflation was happening but often it did not feel that wayThe second lesson of the 1980s is that central bankers can only do so much “Inflation was not conquered in the 1980s by monetary policy alone” argues John Cochrane of Stanford University in a new paper Some say that the liberalising reforms of the 1980s helped in the fight increasing competition and thereby lowering prices imf research has found that labour- and product-market reforms can under certain conditions reduce prices These reforms though probably took some time to kick in Economists can make a stronger case for the role of fiscal policy in the anti-inflation fight In the 1980s policymakers across the world recognised as they had failed to do in the 1970s that loose fiscal policy could add fuel to the inflationary fire They held back on spending even as households’ real incomes declined Mr Cochrane points out that America primary budget deficits ie excluding interest payments were “unremarkable especially given the severe recessions of 1980 and 1981-82” Governments elsewhere were harder-nosed Japan reduced its primary deficit from 32% of gdp in 1980 to a surplus by 1985 Denmark experienced a tough period of austerity Even France kept a firm lid on borrowing A growing number of economists today are urging policymakers to learn these lessons In a new piece Tobias Adrian and Vitor Gaspar of the imf argue that “[f]iscal responsibilitydemonstrates that policymakers are aligned against inflation” They reckon a given fiscal tightening can reduce core inflation by almost as much as a dose of monetary austerity The third lesson of the 1980s is that disinflation is painful The world economy did not benefit from a “soft landing” where inflation falls without provoking recession Average unemployment across the rich world doubled in the five years after 1979 Some parts of the economy cratered Home construction for instance fell by a fifth in 1980-82 Unsurprisingly therefore there was anger A carpenter sent Volcker a plank of wood in the posta symbol that lumber was unneeded since no one was buying houses In Canada car-workers shut down highways Policymakers nonetheless stayed the course showing the public that they were deadly serious about getting inflation under controlIt was acceptable in the 80sDo policymakers today have the stomach for the fight? Coming so soon after the fiscally austere 2010s many are reluctant to tighten the tax-and-spending screws once again Indeed many politicians have gone the other way and now seem uncomfortable with the notion that anyone should lose out from anything ever They are offering hundreds of billions’ dollars-worth of deficit-financed fiscal support that will fuel inflation whether by subsidising energy bills in Europe offering “cost-of-living payments” in Australia and New Zealand or forgiving student debt in America Policymakers are thus ignoring the fundamental lesson of the 1980s Fighting inflation is hard It requires all hands on deck and immense courage over a long period of time It is also unfortunately almost inevitable that some groups lose out if only in the short term As politicians run scared the 2020s risk earning a special place in the history books toofor failing to tame inflation Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Weather is again determining economic outcomes Nov 24thOnly a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thInterest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

During the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 it took American venture-capital managers nearly half a year to report impairments after public markets peaked American buy-out funds held off even longer after listed equities crashed in 2007 In fact public markets began recovering in 2009quickly enough that private investors never had to mark down the full extent of the slump It is unlikely private firms will be able to levitate long enough this time Over a year has passed since the peak of the Nasdaq Composite a tech-heavy index The cash holdings of some private firms are eroding leaving little for return-smoothing financial engineers to play with In August Masayoshi Son the boss of Softbank Group a Japanese investment giant predicted private valuations would rejoin public-market ones within 12 to 18 months Without a 2009-style recovery in public equities in sight an unavoidable downgrade looms No doubt many investors would prefer to continue playing along with the peekaboo charade But soon private-fund managers will have nowhere to hide Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:How crypto goes to zero Nov 24thThe tenacity of ESG investing Nov 17thAre tech stocks now good value?

 Dec 1st 2022,Dubious green funds are rampant in America,It is not easy being green In November Amundi Europe largest investment manager downgraded most of its €45bn $47bn of funds ranked Article 9 the highest grade in the EU sustainability disclosures to Article 8 or “light green” New regulations are forcing many others to recast their wares in less virtuous colours Nearly one-tenth of all Article 9 funds have left the category since the European Commission tightened its criteria in July Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat has exposed European fund managers to accusations of greenwashing and for some the label is deserved But new research published this week in the Review of Finance an academic journal suggests American firms are doing worse When it comes to sustainable investing Wall Street stalwarts appear to run a fully fledged laundromat of exaggerated sales pitches and bogus claimsTo gauge this the authors examined funds that have signed up to the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment PRI a scheme that investment managers can sign up to certify they take account of environmental social and governance ESG principles when making investment decisions On the face of it that is a promisingly large sample: 2000 investors overseeing $135trn of assets now say they will obey the PRI The problem is that such pledges can mean little Looking at the period from 2003 to 2017 researchers found no sign that the portfolios of PRI signatories in America had higher ESG scores across a range of metrics than non-signatories Their peers across the pond scored much higher “There could be a couple of bad apples in Europe But it not the entire cart that rotten” points out Alex Edmans a finance professor at London Business School and the editor of the study American fund managers might argue in their defence that they are trying to help dirty companies get greener rather than simply dumping their shares as European funds might do and are being penalised for this But the researchers find little evidence of that Instead they report that American PRI signatories were less likely to engage as shareholders with the companies they owned than their European counterparts Three years after the initial investment ESG scores at those investee firms were found to be no better Higher grades may not be the answer anyway ESG ratings are themselves often flaky and may be a poor proxy for emissionsThe transatlantic divide the paper suggests may stem from a divergence in regulation Europe rules are tedious and sometimes misguided But at least they provide detailed guidance on what counts as sustainable and how green mandates should fit with fund managers’ fiduciary duties By contrast American firms seem to be defining their own rules; some simply sign up to the PRI in the sole hope of attracting green-conscious investors with little to show for their claims Sometimes greenery is even used to keep assets under management growing even as managers post sub-par returns The authors find that poorly performing American funds are more likely to join the PRI than higher-flying peers For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 30th 2022,How the West price cap on Russian oil could roil energy markets,Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February America energy policy has pursued two grand seemingly contradictory aims The first is to keep global oil supply high enough that prices remain tolerable and public support for sanctions stays strong The second is to asphyxiate Vladimir Putin war machine by stemming the flow of dollars Russia earns by flogging oil barrels Together they form a circle that is hard to square because with supply closely tracking demand amid a dearth of new production taking any oil off the market mechanically triggers higher prices The West has nevertheless tried to defy the law of physics by crafting a growing array of measures to meddle in oil marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe ones that have been deployed until now have often been piecemeal and involve uncomfortable compromises Puncturing its own sanctions against Venezuela thuggish regime on November 26th America granted permission for Chevron a big American oil firm to crank up its production there America has also released huge volumes from its strategic crude-oil stocks; the reserve is now at its lowest level since 1984 The White House least productive effort has aimed to cajole Gulf states into pumping more Within months of President Joe Biden fist-bumping Muhammad Bin Salman the de facto Saudi ruler in Riyadh in July the petrostate and its allies in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC declared they would cut output instead On December 4th the cartel meets again It looks unlikely to help by increasing output now Yet the West most carefully constructed campaign to outsmart Mr Putin has yet to come into action In June the EU announced that come December 5th it would ban imports of Russian seaborne crude oil which accounted for 2m barrels per day b/d or about 40% of Russia total crude exports a year ago Then it said it would also bar European providers of maritime services tankers and insurance from helping non-EU buyers get hold of the Russian barrels it shunsa powerful tool given those firms dominate the global shipping market It soon dawned on America that together those two measures had the potential to squeeze global oil supply And so it insisted on introducing a weakening clause: provided they agree to pay a maximum price set by the G7 for Russia oil non-Western buyers could continue to buy European insuranceAs we went to press the level of this “price cap” was still being debated among Europeans Some led by Poland and the Baltic states want the cap to be low so as to hurt Russia finances Others worried about their shipping industries or retaliation from Russia want to keep it close to market levels Rumours filtering out from the talks suggest it may end up near $60 a barrela discount of nearly 30% to the current price of Brent the global benchmark of $85 a barrelwhich is about what Russia sells its oil for these days anyway Whatever the outcome one thing is certain Never before has such a fiddly set of measures hit the global oil market at once Many of these have been signalled for so long that they may cause few problems But there are reasons to think the boat could be rocked at least for a while In an optimistic scenario the package of sanctions could manage to reconcile the West two contradictory aims The embargo would ensure Europe no longer fuels Mr Putin war: last month the bloc still bought 24m b/d of crude and refined oil from Russia Meanwhile the price cap says an American Treasury official would act as a “release valve” keeping the global market in balance by letting developing countries buy Russian oil at a discount Russia would receive less money whether or not those countries sign up to the plan because the mere existence of a cap or so America reckons would boost their bargaining powerIn the absence of a low enough price cap as is likely to be the case the cost to Russia would be real but modest It would add yet more inconvenience to that created by the West broader arsenal of sanctions which may impair Russia economy in the long run but have hardly proved terminal so far The discounts borne by Russian grades over regional benchmarks have widened in recent weeks but remain well below those seen in the aftermath of the invasion At least the embargo would not roil crude marketsor so commodities markets suggest Brent futures which in June indicated a year-ahead oil price approaching $100 a barrel now place it closer to $85 see chart panel Most traders expect an acceleration of the shift in fuel flows seen so far this year with India and China taking over from Europe as Russia biggest customers This happy story assumes no logistical hiccups will prevent decades-old trading patterns from undergoing a smooth but rapid transition A less rosy scenario however could see sanctions throw spanners in the spigots by introducing unwanted friction Three bottlenecks stand out: a crunch in tankers an insurance gap and a global shortage in risk appetite Start with the tankers Cyprus Greece and Malta loom so large in shipping that Europe ban on the provision of maritime services to countries that do not sign up to the capand many of them loth to endorse American interference in commodity markets have signalled they won’tcould create a big shortage of ships capable of carrying Russian crude Claudio Galimberti of Rystad Energy a data firm anticipates a shortfall of some 70 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of 750000 b/d lasting two to three monthsEventually this problem should work itself out Industry insiders point to an ever growing “dark fleet” that is absorbing vessels from established sanction-busters in Iran and Venezuela Russian firms are bringing mothballed vessels back into service; EU shipowners are also transferring assets to operators outside the G7 A top energy trader reckons that by February there will be enough ships to transport Russian crude though vessels to redirect refined products such as diesel from short-haul routes in Europe to distant new customers may stay scarce for some timeThe crunch in insurance coverage is a bigger potential snag It is not that Middle-Eastern or Asian countries keen on Russian barrels do not have local firms with the financial muscle to insure tankers and cargo What they may soon lack is cover for much bigger risks like oil spills liabilities for which can easily reach half a billion dollars Few insurers new to the market will look forward to becoming liable for an ageing Venezuelan vessel going through Danish straits a mere 15m deep says a veteran oil trader without a big backstop The problem is that this sort of backstopreinsurancedemands deep pools of private capital hard to find outside the West Perhaps the Chinese and Indian governments could be persuaded to offer sovereign reinsurance though market insiders doubt they have the stomach In fact some traders reckon Asian buyers could buy less Russian oil rather than more as the insurance ban comes into forceThe third bottleneck could be a lack of appetite outside the g7 for the perceived risks of circumventing a scheme designed by the West Many do not believe American promises to remain hands-off if countries choose to go around the cap It does not help that in its most recent sanction campaigns such as those targeted at Iran America has studiously kept the perimeter and degree of enforcement of penalties vague so as to deter anyone from dealing with its foes The practice known in sanctions parlance as “constructive ambiguity” is hard to roll backAll this could cause a chunk of Russian oil exports to fall off the map prompting prices to jump But a much worse scenario where Russia voluntarily slashes its oil exports and prices get out of control is also possible It may happen if China having to forsake its purchases from other countries to buy yet more Russian oil tries to drive too hard a bargain More likely it would be a unilateral decision by Mr Putin It could incur huge costs: Russia derives 40% of its export revenues from oil sales But that might be worth bearing temporarily if it drives global prices up hurting the West and giving Russia more leverage in negotiations with buyers without inflicting intolerable damage to wells The country decision to shut temporarily nearly 2m b/d of crude production during the pandemic resulted in only a 300000 b/d loss in long-term capacity according to Energy Intelligence an industry publisherUp to now the G7 energy policy has been hashed out in painstaking detail in Washington DC and Brussels But to paraphrase Mike Tyson everyone has a great plan until they get punched in the faceand facing serious setbacks on the battlefield Mr Putin is pulling no punches right now The price-cap first contact with reality could be rough For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 28th 2022,Ending China zero-covid policy could unleash chaos,Not all businesses have struggled through China zero-covid era Andon Health a Shenzhen-listed company that makes covid tests and medical devices for example posted a 32000% increase in net profits in the first three quarters of the year compared with the same period in 2021 as it cranked out testing devices for China and America The 35 largest companies producing covid-19 tests raked in some 150bn yuan $21bn in revenues in the first half of 2022 minting a new generation of pandemic tycoonsBut outside China covid-industrial complex the economy is suffering Lockdowns and onerous restrictions on movement have stunted consumer confidence and economic growth Over the past fortnight they have inspired protests across the country with tensions escalating over the weekend Young people on the streets of Shanghai on November 27th rejected the prospect of endless testing and lockdowns chanting: “We don’t want covid tests; we want freedom”The economic effects of China attempt to rid itself of the virus have never been clearer The movement of people has been severely curtailed During the week of November 14th as covid cases rose the number of domestic flights fell by 45% year on year China three biggest airlines lost a combined 74bn yuan in the first nine months of 2022 Subway traffic in China ten largest cities was down by 32% year on year according to Macquarie an Australian investment bank Box-office revenues a gauge of people willingness to go out and about tumbled by 64% Only 42% of China cinemas were open on November 27th Some of the largest cinemas have closed down altogetherLockdowns are now in place in cities accounting for about a quarter of China gdp surpassing a previous peak of about a fifth in mid-April when Shanghai was shuttered according to an index compiled by Nomura a Japanese investment bank China youth unemployment rate hit a record high in July at 199% A measure of road-freight throughput in the week to November 25th was 33% below its level the year beforeWith covid infections hitting unprecedented highs economic policymakers are attempting to gin up the economy The central bank has announced a cut to lenders’ required reserve ratios Technocrats have attempted to breathe new life and confidence into China property market where sales have plummeted over the past year Easing measures announced in mid-November have sought to help struggling developers gain access to credit so that they can continue building Sentiment is expected to improve a little in time But continued lockdowns and dire consumer confidence will probably stop potential homebuyers making purchases And the prospects for the economy as a whole in 2023 are looking increasingly gloomy Keeping out covid once looked like a good plan As the rest of the world suffered from the seemingly unstoppable spread of new variants in 2021 China appeared to have largely returned to normal life Its covid-related deaths are a tiny fraction of the covid-related deaths suffered in the rest of the world But even as other places learnt to live with the virus in 2022 China covid policy starting with the lockdown of Shanghai the country main business hub has appeared utterly disorganised and repressive Citizens have been subjected to endless testing Businesses and residential areas can be clamped down without warning Travel between cities and provinces has become onerous with each local government enforcing its own version of covid restrictionsRumours of reopening have swirled for weeks sending Chinese stocks on a wild ride The central government issued a list of 20 measures on November 11th meant to relax various covid restrictions such as removing the need for secondary contacts to quarantine and reducing inbound travellers’ quarantine from seven to five days The measures were received by stockmarkets as a sign that China was planning to phase out zero-covid But China leadership did not intend to send such a signal Instead the loosening was just a fine-tuning of the policy aimed probably at making it more bearable for a longer period And even then the relaxations have been implemented in a hodge-podge manner As case numbers have risen in many cities local officials have reverted to broad arbitrary lockdownsWith pressure building on many fronts leaders in Beijing must contend with the notion that they will eventually lose control of both the virus and public patience The path forward is murky Few analysts believe China is preparing for an imminent reopening Instead many see a period of confusion and painful policy blunders immediately ahead For at least the next four months or until after an important political meeting in March leaders in Beijing are expected to uphold zero-covid while also attempting to refine their methods This situation could persist through much of 2023 if central government authorities fail to devise an exit strategyUnder these conditions the outlook for the economy is grim The locking down of businesses residential areas and even entire districts is likely to continue although full-city shutdowns might be avoided Local officials may also do this without formally announcing lockdowns in an attempt to appear to be upholding the new loosening measures This will only add to confusion Many of the current troubles facing airlines and cinema companies will probably continue and spread to other consumer-facing businessesMultinational companies can expect continued disruptions And American consumers shopping for a new phone will also get a taste of zero-covid A recent lockdown of a Chinese plant that assembles iPhones has caused severe disruptions for Apple The factory which employs 200000 people and is owned by Foxconn a Taiwanese company suffered from an outbreak in October that forced a partial lockdown Food became scarce Rubbish piled up By early November many employees made a run for it hopping over walls and walking down motorways in an attempt to get homeTo resolve the labour shortages officials in Henan province where the factory is located have called on low-level Communist Party functionaries to begin staffing production lines while Foxconn tries to recruit more workers Production will probably still fall short There is also potential for an even more disorderly 2023 in which cases run wild and authorities are forced to abandon zero-covid Many China-watchers have been enticed by the prospects of the endwhether planned or forcedof the policy Some have envisioned the country transitioning from its current sclerotic state to business as usual with minimal disruption between the two phases This rosy outlook fails to account for what could become one of the world largest public-health upheavals in recent memory: a vast resurgence in cases across a population almost entirely new to the virusThis period could include a pervasive slowdown in commercial activity Both shopkeepers and shoppers may choose to shelter at home Factories could temporarily stop running as infections sweep across production floors Policy confusion and inconsistencies between counties cities and provinces might snarl supply chains for weeks Some local officials who have been trained over the past three years to avoid covid cases at all costs would probably rely on stealth lockdowns to curtail the spread These conditions if the transmission of the virus is allowed to take place fairly rapidly could last for a quarter at a minimum Ting Lu of Nomura says that the regions covered by lockdowns during this phase could account for as much as 40% of GDP with output falling over one or two quarters Even if China were to end zero-covid immediately the positive economic effects would probably not be felt until 2024 say analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy The interim period would be one of turbulence and instability Growth would be lowand depending on how local authorities carry out covid restrictions protests may very well continue

 Nov 24th 2022,Why American unemployment needs to rise,An unemployment problem as normally understood occurs when lots of people cannot find work Northfield a city in Minnesota with a population of 20000 exemplifies the troubles that arise at the opposite end of the spectrum: when unemployment is so low that lots of businesses and organisations cannot find workers Along with Utah Minnesota has the lowest unemployment rate of any state in America at 21% And in Minnesota Northfield has just about the lowest unemployment rate of any city a mere 12%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf an authoritarian regime were to report such a figure it would elicit groans of disbelief In Northfield the groans are of inconvenience Police officers teachers and factory workers are all in short supply The local hospital needs nursing assistants and surgical technicians The city main retirement home has empty units but not enough employees resulting in a long waiting list Unable to hire enough servers a popular restaurant closed this summer and a favourite café has slashed its hours The local newspaper meanwhile just lost its one sports reporter who took a better-paid job as a forklift operatorMinnesota and this corner of it in particular might sound like an outlier They are in fact extreme cases of a dynamic now common throughout America Nationally there are nearly two job vacancies for every unemployed person just shy of a record high hit a few months earlier In Minnesota the ratio is an eye-popping 35 vacancies per unemployed person also just shy of a recent record and higher than any other state Minnesota ultra-tight labour market sheds light on three questions for the country as a whole How did things get so overstretched? What are the consequences of this degree of tightness? And will balance ever be restored?Employers big and small in Northfield which is a picturesque settlement straddling a river agree that the covid-19 pandemic was the dividing line With about 700 employees Post Consumer Brands a cereal maker is one of the biggest manufacturers in town Before the pandemic struck it regularly had a vacancy rate of 1% or less Now the rate is more like 5% At Minnesota Soulstice a clothing boutique the owner has been so short-staffed that at one point she had to personally work 18 straight days Even when positions are filled candidate numbers are way down When the city advertised for a police job in 2017 it received 55 applications In September it advertised for three positions and received 15 applicationsJust as elsewhere in America there is a litany of explanations for the shortfall of workers Older residents left the labour force in 2020 preferring early retirement to the dangers and hassle of work at the height of the pandemic Cancellation of school meant many parents most often women had to look after children With two liberal-arts colleges in town Northfield usually has lots of part-time student workers But many are now less keen on off-campus jobs Personal savings have soared over the past few years owing to a combination of stimulus cheques and reduced spending on things like concerts and travel This has given some students a useful financial bufferSandwiched between Minnesota biggest citiesMinneapolis and Rochester are an hour drive in either directionNorthfield can tap into a big labour pool But the pool is smaller than it was In the early 2010s the state received more than 15000 immigrants a year Over the past five years inflows have slowed to a trickle under the weight of pandemic border closures and Donald Trump anti-immigration stance Minnesota was also one of the states that lost residents to other parts of the country during covid About 13500 left between April 2020 and July 2021 many lured by opportunities in warmer climes “It used to be that workers were out there and we just had to figure out how to recruit them into manufacturing” says Bob Kill president of Enterprise Minnesota a consultancy “The difference this time is that the bodies don’t exist to fill the jobs”For those job hunting the going is good Not only is employment plentiful but wages are increasing Private-sector pay in Minnesota main metropolitan cluster which includes Northfield rose 57% year-on-year in September in nominal terms ranking third in the country Firms have also become more attentive Mr Kill says that the old manufacturing schedule of eight hours a day five days a week is all but gone Companies now let workers opt for four ten-hour days At the Post factory bosses recently encouraged a worker on the cusp of retirement to stay for two days a weekan arrangement rarely seen in the past “We got to retain a very highly skilled person doing a job that we need fulfilled” says Henry Albers a managerEmployers have also succeeded in eking out slightly more output from their limited resources This can be seen in Minnesota statewide data Overall its labour force is 3% smaller compared with the eve of the pandemic but its gdp is nearly 2% bigger At the Post factory the production lines churning out such delights as Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles have long been automated with workers monitoring computer screens and fixing robots rather than doing heavy lifting But there is always scope for more Mr Albers hopes to use high-tech tools to cut training times for new employees In schools meanwhile changes in licensing requirements have made it a little easier to recruit people without full qualifications Northfield has its high-school kitchen manager leading the consumer-science course “We would have never done that five years ago” says Matt Hillmann superintendent of Northfield public schoolsAt the state level officials are also thinking about how to attract more workers The Democrats swept Minnesota elections earlier this month holding onto its governorship and state house and adding the state senate This places them in a position to consider more ambitious legislation One idea is to introduce publicly paid leave for illness and caring for family memberssomething no state in the Midwest offers “This could be a differentiator saying: ‘Hey if you work in Minnesota we’ll take care of you’” reckons Steve Grove head of the state economic-development department The Democrats have also vowed to fund the construction of more affordable housing a necessity for younger workers Indeed one reason Northfield unemployment rate is lower than nearby areas is that at an average price of about $350000 its homes are expensive for a town of its size making it hard to live there without a jobMinnesota labour market may be able to find balance in a few ways Techno-optimists think a rise in automation will help firms get by with fewer workers Some managers themselves are sceptical noting that many processes are already automated “You can’t automate thinking” quips one manufacturing veteran Northfield Hospital and Clinics the leading health-care provider for the area has adopted a handful of labour-saving technologies from automated screening at entrances to greater use of telemedicine “These are all Johnny Appleseed techniques” says Steve Underdahl president of Northfield Hospital and Clinics In other words it will take time to reap benefitsExpanding the pool of workers would help Perhaps Minnesota will succeed in enticing more Americans to its friendly if occasionally frigid embrace Along with plenty of job vacancies Northfield boasts an appealing motto Who doesn’t like “Cows colleges and contentment”? If Minnesota is successful however it would export some of its labour headache to other parts of the country More arrivals from abroad would be a much bigger help but it is hard to imagine the floodgates opening given the toxic national politics around immigration And Minnesota like much of America faces a demographic crunch “It a math problem We know that baby boomers are continuing to leave the workforce” says Mr Hillmann the school superintendent Five of the city 25 police officers are set to retire in the next two yearsThat leaves another less pleasant solution: an economic slowdown that brings some slack back to the labour market The Federal Reserve has jacked up interest rates Virtually all economists think that slower growth is inevitable next year though they debate whether it will amount to a recession One critical variable is the extent to which companies are able to reduce their demand for new workers without firing existing onesAs the tightest corner of the ultra-taut American labour market Minnesota bears watching Its unemployment rate has started to tick up rising from 18% in June to 21% last month It might seem perverse to call that good news but one lesson from the past year is that excessively low unemployment really does hurt: it constrains and corrodes the services offered by hospitals schools restaurants and more In Northfield there is at least one tiny hint that relief might be at hand After a difficult dry spell the HideAway a downtown café received four job applications over the past two weeks From those it hired two sorely needed baristas “We just got lucky” reckons Joan Spaulding its owner Or was it a new trend?

 Nov 24th 2022,Western officials need banks’ help to keep money flowing to Russia,When western firms fled Russia after its invasion of Ukraine banks and insurers joined the exodus They feared prosecution in the criminal courts for sanctions violations and in the court of public opinion for filling Vladimir Putin war chest The West economic shock-and-awe campaign has largely isolated Russia from the international financial systemListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut recently Western officials have emphasised they want to see money flowing into parts of Russia economy and financial firms to enable this On November 14th America Britain and the eu issued a statement making clear that sanctions target Russia war machine not its food or fertiliser industries Diplomats have reiterated the message in the days since seeking to ensure sanctions do not work too wellWestern governments have a needle to thread They want to starve Russia of war funds and prove their anti-Putin chops but also to minimise collateral damage “When you’re ramping up sanctions ambiguity is your best friend It is your biggest enemy when trying tocalibrate them to the needs of the global economy” says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn a law firm The renewal of a grain deal between Russia and Ukraine which allows food out of Ukrainian ports explains the recent push To get Moscow to sign officials sought to show they were not blocking Russia food and fertiliser exports which comprise 14% and 18% of global volumes America does not want “to impede the ability of developing countries” to buy these goods says a State Department officialThe problem is that politicians and campaigners have not got the message In September members of Congress excoriated the bosses of JPMorgan Chase and Citibank two American banks for doing business with Russian oil and gas firms despite guidance from the Treasury permitting it As Juan Zarate the architect of America sanctions after the September 11th attacks notes: “Corporate concerns regarding transparency accountability and integrity have increased exponentially” esg requirements only add to the burdenEven before esg financiers were supremely reputation-conscious They are also aware politics can shift In 2016 John Kerry then secretary of state criss-crossed Europe to prod banks to do business in Iran after America had lifted sanctions Bankers spooked by Republican opposition balked at the roadshow This was wise: Donald Trump later reimposed sanctionsSo far Western efforts to keep cash flowing into Russian agriculture and parts of its energy sector appear to be working reasonably well Officials have provided guidelines laying out exemptions They also have been in touch with compliance teams about which industries remain fair game and have written “comfort letters” when required Russian wheat exports are now almost back to normal levels and global food prices are at a nine-month lowBut fertiliser costs remain high meaning more reassurance will probably be needed in the future Rebeca Grynspan of the un trade arm has warned that bankers’ fears of “reputation risks” are still causing elevated export costs On November 21st the Netherlands finally released 20000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser that had been stuck in Rotterdam owing to sanctions-related confusion It is an oddity of modern sanctions regimes that officials must spend time helping money flow into their enemy economy For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis
 Nov 24th 2022,Weather is again determining economic outcomes,“Now the rains had really come” writes Chinua Achebe in “Things Fall Apart” a novel set in 19th-century Nigeria “so heavy and persistent that even the village rainmaker no longer claimed to be able to intervene He could not stop the rain now just as he would not attempt to start it in the heart of the dry season without serious danger to his own health” In agrarian economies of the sort depicted in Achebe novel the economic cycle and weather move in tandem When the rains arrive at the right time the harvest is bountiful and prosperity follows In contrast drought brings the risk of starvation and death The rainmakermuch like the modern-day central bankermay attempt to smooth out the business cycle literally dampening things down when they get too hot Ultimately though it is the power of nature that decides the outcomeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEurope energy crisis has brought the return of weather-based economics The crisis is a reminder that for all their technological sophistication even rich-world economies must rely on the munificence of nature European economists financiers and policymakers are watching forecasts closely: a balmy winter will bring relief requiring less gas to be burned in order to keep houses warm If temperatures are not too punishing energy prices will fall and growth be given a boost A frosty winter on the other hand will bring misery: pushing millions into poverty increasing inflationary pressures and keeping industries shutteredFossil fuels originally promised to free economies from the vagaries of the seasons Instead of relying on ambient solar powercaptured in grain preserved in livestock or photosynthesised into biomass and then consumed as firewoodhumanity could burn coal releasing the prehistoric solar power contained within The use of fossil fuels allowed energy to be stored transported and released exactly when required They placed the power of the sun at the beck and call of mankind rather than the other way around Ann Kussmaul an economic historian tracked the spread of the Industrial Revolution through England by assessing when regions moved beyond seasonal economics Parish marriage certificates measured the point at which fossil fuels freed workers from the rhythms of nature and instead tied them to the factory whistle Before industrialisation marriages in low-lying areas would often be in winter after the harvest was taken; in hilly areas they would be during summer once the lambing season had come to an end After industrialisation such regional and seasonal marriage patterns disappeared providing a clue as to which parts of England first adopted fossil-fuel-based production techniquesHundred of years later seasonality is returning to Britain and other parts of Europe as the continent weans itself from Russian gas Part of the reason for this return is physical Natural gas is much harder to transport and store than coal or liquid oil In the past Europe benefited from abundant piped gas provided by Russia as well as the option of top-ups of liquefied natural gas shipped from abroad Now supplies are tight and Europeans must mostly rely on the shipped stuff The continent storage facilities are already more than 90% full and filling the last bits of available space is expensive since the contents must be kept under high pressure Constrained supply means that changes in demand determine the price of energyand the weather is the most uncertain determinant of demandAutumn spared Europe the worst: the continent enjoyed the hottest October on record As a result the price for a unit of gas on the Dutch title transfer facility which provides the benchmark for the continent fell to around €100 per megawatt hour half the rate in September But now winter is starting to make itself felt Germany first snows have arrived Historically there has been a relatively linear relationship between gas demand and the temperature: the colder it gets the more gas is needed This year things are a little more complicated Home-heating systems have been left dormant for longer than usual Blanket sales are on the rise People are willing to wrap up warm to resist Vladimir Putin The gas crisis is not the only reason for a greater focus on the weather Renewables now supply much more energy to Europe than even a few years ago leading to problems if the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine Indeed hydropower has also been an issue for Europe this year after a hot summer dried out the reservoirs and rivers on which dams depend Improving and investing in ways to store electricity whether batteries hydrogen or other techniques could in future smooth out such variability The continent nonetheless faces years or even decades of nervously watching the skies as it adjustsYet in the absence of a transition to green forms of energy the weather would begin to play an even bigger role in economics A warmer planet is already leading to more frequent and extreme events such as Europe summer heatwaves or the devastating floods endured by Pakistan These events amount to so-called real shocks to an economy: external changes that lower productive capacity and so cause both higher inflation and unemploymentHead in the cloudsThis dual threat is harder for central bankers to deal with than downturns that arise from changes in business confidence or a financial crisis Tighten policy too much in response and it will exacerbate the downturn; too little and inflation may get out of hand According to analysis by the imf of Pacific and Caribbean islands natural-disaster-prone countries grow by around one percentage point less a year and have considerably higher debt stocks than those less at risk Climate change will only exacerbate these differences Thus a return to weather-dependent economics will leave some central bankers looking even more like rainmakers: attempting to perform the old rituals or demanding more sacrifices without much capacity to affect the economic weather Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Only a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thInterest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

 Nov 23rd 2022,How crypto goes to zero,If everyone stopped using it That in five words is how crypto would go to zero Still the journey is more interesting than the destination The death of ftx an exchange declared bankrupt on November 11th after a spectacular blow-up will encourage some people to turn their attention elsewhere What would have to happen for everyone to give up?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAn answer requires a sense of how the industry works At crypto base are blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum which record transactions verified by computers a process incentivised by the issuance of new tokens The Ethereum blockchain validates lines of code which has made it possible for people to issue their own tokens or build applications These include stablecoins which are pegged to real-world currencies and tokens like Uniswap which manage decentralised-finance DeFi protocols Major chains and a handful of Ethereum-based tokens like stablecoins account for about 90% of cryptocurrency value Big businesses have been built on top of this world including exchanges investment funds and lending platforms To take out crypto entirely would require killing the underlying blockchain layers They could either give way first kicking the stool out from underneath everything else Or the industry could unravel from the top down layer by layer like a knitted scarf Knocking the stool out is extraordinarily hard and the current high value of bitcoin and ether makes it even harder To attack a blockchain and shut it down requires gaining 51% control of the computational power or value of tokens staked to verify transactions The more valuable the tokens the more energy it takes to attack a proof-of-work chain like Bitcoin and the more money to attack a proof-of-stake chain like Ethereum The security of these chainsas measured by the amount someone would have to spend to attack themis now in the region of $10bn to $15bn It would require either a government or an extraordinarily rich individual to mount such an attack And even if Elon Musk was so inclined he seems a little busy at presentUnravelling is therefore the more conceivable path The events of this year have revealed just how prone to this sort of thing crypto is The implosion that seems to have set the chaos in motion was that of Terra-Luna a decentralised stablecoin system worth around $40bn at its peak It collapsed in May wiping $200bn off the market capitalisation of crypto That led a few weeks later to the demise of several lending platforms and a hedge fund events which wiped another $200bn off the market cap The margin calls these platforms faced appear to have imperilled Alameda the trading firm owned by Sam Bankman-Fried and prompted the decision to use ftx customer funds to plug the gap When ftx failed it wiped another $200bn off crypto market cap Now other exchanges and lending platforms look to be in troubleBeady-eyed readers will note that most of this stuff apart from Terra-Luna is in the “on top of” category and not actually on-chain tech DeFi exchanges and lending protocols have continued to whirr even as the enterprises more akin to normal businesses have imploded one by one But the collapse of these enterprises could imperil the underlying tech by taking out chunks of its value making the chains more exposed to would-be attackers and pushing miners or stakers to switch off their machines The value of on-chain activity and tokens is self-reinforcing The more people that use DeFi the more valuable Ethereum becomes The higher the price of ether the higher the hurdle to attack the blockchain and the more confidence people will have that blockchains will endure This also works in reverse The more people shy away from crypto out of fear the less secure it becomes The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is currently $820bn That is 70% below the peak a year ago but still high compared with most of crypto history It is higher than at the start of last year for instance and any point before then including the peak of the bull market in 2017 Many more layerssuch as a major stablecoin big businesses or perhaps other on-chain protocolswould have to unravel to take crypto value back to the levels at which it traded just three or four years ago Crypto reputation has been undermined before It has collapsed in value repeatedly throughout its lifetime Although fewer people will use crypto as a result of the ftx collapse it is very hard to imagine the number will be small enough to take its value to zero For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 22nd 2022,Xi Jinping big bang for Chinese stockmarkets,In a parallel universe CloudWalk might have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in Hong Kong or New York The firm is one of the world leading facial-recognition outfits: its technology can recognise people in milliseconds with astonishing accuracy But modern geopolitics pushed it in another direction America has imposed sanctions on the firm for alleged human-rights violations owing to reputed links with China military So instead of listing on the nasdaq in New York CloudWalk chose Shanghai star Market a bourse set up in 2019 to attract China rising tech companies The company share price is up by a fifth since its debut in MayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCloudWalk listing is one of hundreds that have put Shanghai star and Shenzhen ChiNext another tech-focused market at the heart of global initial public offerings ipos this year Firms have raised $63bn on Chinese exchanges compared with just $21bn in New York and $6bn in Hong Kong The vast majority of proceeds has been raised by semiconductor makers artificial-intelligence and business-software startups robotics firms and other companies developing high-end technology A flurry of smaller telecommunications firms have flocked to the Beijing Stock Exchange which launched last year under the guidance of Xi Jinping China leader At first glance this suggests Mr Xi plan to match a burgeoning tech industry with effervescent capital marketspart of a grander effort to make China a leader in next-generation technologiesis proceeding to perfection Look a little deeper however and the picture is murkier State capital or “guidance capital” in Communist Party parlance is flooding into stockmarkets Our analysis of the 38 largest ipos in Chinese markets in the first three quarters this year which together account for 242bn yuan $34bn or about 50% of cash raised finds that state entities put up 22% of funding A review of a similar sample of ipos last year shows state capital providing a smaller 14% The CloudWalk deal is typical State investors including the Shanghai city government an arms manufacturer and local-government funds stumped up more than 500m yuan for just under a third of the company shares Although China capital markets are increasingly directed by the Communist Party the boom has other causes too Some observers see merely a surge in innovative firms meeting demand from fluid capital markets Nicolas Aguzin chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has called the flurry of tech ipos a “big bang of finance” State media in China also highlight tensions with America Several Chinese tech firms in addition to CloudWalk have been sanctioned This year markets in New York have all but closed to Chinese companies even if there are some signs the situation is starting to improveMeanwhile China regulatory regime has become more friendly Not long ago onerous reviews were required for new listings This led to a backlog sometimes stretching to thousands of firms and prevented private-equity investors from exiting investments A new system trialled in the star and ChiNext exchanges is currently being rolled out to others It is more in line with international standards setting requirements for listings but dropping the arduous inspections Liquidity and stability have also improved Over the past five years reforms have encouraged the professionalisation of investment Volatile retail trading has been reduced All this fits with Mr Xi publicly outlined vision for Chinese finance in which markets are freer from meddling operating more like ones in America Yet the rush of state money can hardly be ignored Although some of the cash comes from insurers and pension funds most comes from government-backed funds tasked with investing across public and private markets often with a remit to support certain industries such as semiconductor or industrial-robot makers As Ngor Luong of the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology a think-tank notes this money signals to other investors which firms are worthy of funding meaning it carries additional weight The use of state money to direct private investment is an approach that has spread from private to public markets Between 2015 and 2021 government-backed private-equity outfits raised more than 7trn yuan A company that takes state cash in its early stages becomes more attractive to private investors later on since it indicates the firm fits with the official vision of innovation These companies often benefit from other government help including tax breaks cheaper rents and less red tape In the same way securing state-backed investors in an ipo can now make or break deals According to a banker working on Chinese ipos this means policymakers are increasingly successful at directing private capital to the industries they wish to prioritise Companies involved in technologies judged important by policymakers may now receive state capital throughout their life cycle Take Loongson a semiconductor firm in Beijing that designs central processing units Most shares in the company are held by Hu Weiwu its founder But the firm was set up in 2008 with capital from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing city government State funds including a semiconductor backer which has invested 200bn yuan have subsidised Loongson in recent years despite its privately owned status When the firm went public on star this year state investors piled in buying at least 10% of the offeringThis sort of investment is not only about boosting favoured industries Officials have been sending a message about the importance of state capital in the market for some time notes Pan Fenghua of Beijing Normal University Last year regulators began talking of a “disorderly expansion of capital” that supposedly had led to economic imbalances Free-market capital has brought many ailments argued a recent editorial in a state newspaper These include a widening wealth gap environmental problems financial risks and monopolies In a socialist market economy such as China the editorial states capital must be guided by the Communist PartyBecause so many firms have taken state investment investors must now either buy the Party plan or stay out says an investment manager in Shanghai Buying the Party plan may be an unattractive proposition Even before the government began to play a greater role Chinese markets underperformed Aside from a few rapid booms and busts China main stock indices have hardly gained in value over the past decade Some 27% of companies that went public on star between 2019 and 2021 now trade below their ipo price That figure rises to 44% among those that listed more recently as state capital has poured into the market On the Beijing Stock Exchange Mr Xi brainchild it hits a dismal 60%Shanghai and Shenzhen may have become the leading global destination for tech ipos but they have done so with remarkably little global capital Because of concerns about China draconian covid-19 rules and faltering property market foreign investors have been quitting the country in droves According to the Institute of International Finance a trade association a net $76bn of international capital flowed out of the country stockmarkets in October alone Market booms in New York and Hong Kong typically draw smart capital from a wide range of global investors In contrast Mr Xi big bang appears painfully insular He believes the state can fill the role played by foreign financiers It is to say the least a bold experiment For more

 Nov 17th 2022,Big emerging-market companies worry investors,Since september when a botched budget in Britain roiled markets enough to threaten giant pension funds investors have been looking for other vulnerabilities that might cause markets to break Emerging economies are a prime candidate Historically high American interest rates and a soaring dollar have triggered financial instability across the developing world A few unlucky places including Argentina and Sri Lanka have stumbled into crisis this time round but many emerging-market governments have deeper foreign-exchange reserves and less dollar-denominated debt than before and thus look much sturdier than even a decade ago Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBig firms in these countries are a different story Debt issued by large companies has risen relentlessly since the turn of the millenniumfrom just over 60% of emerging-market gdp in 2000 to more than 90% on the eve of the covid-19 pandemicas firms took advantage of low interest rates Borrowing then jumped a further ten percentage points in 2020 alone Much of this money is owed to foreigners Although governments in emerging economies began to borrow in their own currencies after blow-ups in the 1990s corporate debt is still mostly denominated in foreign currencies meaning local-currency depreciation leads to a deterioration in companies’ balance-sheets According to JPMorgan Chase a bank the default rate for emerging-market issuers of high-yield corporate debt has jumped to 114% this year well above the 17% notched in 2019 and the long-term average of 37% Higher rates and an expensive dollar are only partly to blame Troubles have been concentrated in China where property-market woes have kept default rates in the sector at double-digit levels for two consecutive years as well as in Russia and Ukraine Russian firms are expected to default on debt worth $28bn in 2023 equivalent to two-thirds of the remaining stock of debt Nevertheless markets have for the most part already priced in losses reckons JPMorgan so defaults are unlikely to spark a wider crisisIt is problems elsewhere that look more troubling Rising rates and slowing growth have taken a toll on property markets around the world and this is now creating difficulties for firms outside China as well as within A default in late September on short-term debt issued by the developer of Legoland Korea has thrown debt markets in South Korea into turmoil Yields on short-term debt have shot up to the highest levels since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In late October the government said it would buy around $35bn in corporate bonds in order to stabilise markets In recent weeks property troubles have also popped up in other emerging Asian economies Liquidity has evaporated from Vietnamese corporate-bond markets following an effort by officials to rein in corruption in the country property market As prices for developers’ shares and bonds tumble the central bank is weighing intervention to keep the market functioning Indonesian developers face similar difficulties Prices for the bonds of several large firms have fallen to distressed levels amid credit-rating downgrades and fears that default risks are growingThis spreading financial unease may seem reminiscent of past panics including the devastating crisis that ripped across Asian economies in 1997 and 1998 There are though good reasons to hope trouble will be contained Rising rates have hurt property markets but most big firms pay fixed coupons on their bonds and have not issued much new debt over the past year Governments across Asia have fiscal room to support their economies and hefty piles of foreign-exchange reservesYet both Britain budget fiasco and the sudden collapse of ftx a cryptocurrency-trading platform demonstrate how quickly financial vulnerabilities can crystallise into problems A few wobbles among emerging-market bonds could prove a few too many for comfort For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 17th 2022,Only a revived economy can save China property industry,Many elderly Chinese suffer from what they call the “three highs”: those of blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol According to some economists such as Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences the property market suffers from “three highs” of its own Prices are lofty especially in the peripheries of big cities The debt of property developers is too high because they must hold expensive illiquid assets like land And households sink too much wealth into property because they see it as a lucrative investment rather than a place to liveListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn an aggressive attempt to cure these maladies China policymakers have created several others The flow of finance to property developers has slowed abruptly since the government imposed limits on their borrowing in 2020 forcing dozens into default This has reduced the pace of construction for flats many of which were sold in advance And these delays have in turn contributed to a sharp slowdown in property sales especially among people who now doubt that they will receive any flat they might purchaseOn November 11th China central bank and banking regulator issued a plan to tackle some of these problems They will encourage commercial banks to help finance stalled homebuilding projects alongside state-directed “policy banks” They will temporarily suspend limits on banks’ exposure to real estate and urge them to extend the maturities of loans which are due in the next six months And regulators will guarantee new bonds issued by developers they consider viable including private-sector firms It is not clear this will be enough to solve developers’ woes The measures will do more to increase the flow of finance and pace of construction than to revive sales In the first ten months of this year China property firms sold 941m square metres of residential floor space a quarter less than in the same period last year Boosting this figure would do wonders for these firms’ balance-sheets and their creditors’ chances of repayment But any attempt to revive sales raises hard questions for policymakers If sales now are too slow what pace would be too fast? To solve this year crisis must people be tempted to buy more housing than they need?China president Xi Jinping insists that housing is for living in not speculation To stick to this instruction home-building in China cities ought not to exceed “fundamental” demand which depends on the growth of China urban population and its desire for living space But China property market is sometimes called upon to serve other purposes too During the global financial crisis in 2008 China stimulated construction to employ laid-off manufacturing workers and save the economy Demand for housing then acquired a speculative momentum of its own Between 2011 and 2015 China built roughly 18% more flats than it required to meet fundamental demand according to a paper published last year by Wu Jing and Xu Mandi of Tsinghua University And it did that even after demolishing over 7m old or decrepit homes a yearDemand for living space in China cities will grow more slowly in the years ahead Having torn down so many old buildings in recent years China bulldozers are running out of targets The proportion of urban homes without an independent toilet fell from 32% in 2000 to 15% in 2015 point out Mr Wu and Ms Xu The property market must also contend with an unwelcome bend in the so-called urbanisation curve Ray Northam a geographer noted in 1975 that urban centres are “a complex baffling and not easily understood creation of man” Nonetheless he argued that they grow in a somewhat predictable fashion The fraction of a country population living in cities follows an attenuated s shape rising slowly during an initial stage of growth more quickly during an acceleration stage then slowing and flattening off during a terminal stage Mr Wu and Ms Xu show that the acceleration stage in China ended some time around 2007 Since then the country has been in the upper half of the s Its urbanisation rate reached 65% in 2021 and can be expected to rise by only a little over one percentage point a year for the rest of this decadeWhat does this mean for property sales? The paper by Mr Wu and Ms Xu relies on China census and mini-census which appear at five-year intervals This makes it hard to adjust the numbers to take account of recent events But an alternative model based on annual data was published in 2020 by China Index Academy the country biggest property-research institute It calculated that developers’ sales volumes would need to shrink by about 37% a year in 2021-25 to remain in line with demand a worrying conclusion for firms which desperately need sales to riseFrom S to V?Yet the true picture is not quite as gloomy This year collapse has been so profound that developers are now far behind the schedule laid out by China Index Academy From the start of 2020 to October this year they sold only about 80% of the floor space the model projected for that period That gives the property market some scope to rebound from this crisis before resuming a stately long-term decline The level of sales envisaged by the model for 2023 is well below last year peak but it is also 16% higher than the pace of sales this year In theory therefore China property market has room for a cyclical upturn even in the midst of a longer-term decline meaning policymakers can try to revive sales without stoking speculative demand Yet even such a limited rebound is far from guaranteed Developers may succeed in rolling over debts and completing ongoing projects They may struggle to attract new custom Consumer confidence remains near record lows No one knows how or when China will exit its damaging “zero-covid” policy For as long as economic growth remains precarious households will be wary of the outlays that are required to buy a home In the past a property revival has saved China economy Now only a revived economy can save Chinese property Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Interest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

 Nov 15th 2022,Even a global recession may not bring down inflation,Investors have swooned at the good news Since early October European shares have risen with optimists declaring an end to the continent energy crisis in sight Chinese stocks have jumped at recent talk that Xi Jinping will abandon his “zero-covid” policy and as regulators have loosened their curbs on the property sector On November 10th on the news that America consumer-price inflation had come in slightly below economists’ expectations the tech-heavy nasdaq index rose by 7% one of the biggest ever daily moves as investors priced in lower interest rates Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut take a step back and the outlook has in fact darkened in recent weeks The global economy is slowing perhaps into a recession as central banks ramp up interest rates to battle a once-in-a-generation surge in prices see chart 1 Even with one month of better-than-expected data for America there is scant evidence that inflation is anywhere near defeated see chart 2 Indeed in much of the world it is broadening out For most of this year people have worried about a downturn In June Google searches for “recession” neared a record high For a long time however the gloomy rhetoric ran ahead of reality Output in the median rich country increased by about 13% from the end of 2021 to the third quarter of this yearnot spectacular but not bad In the year to September the average unemployment rate in the oecd a club of mostly rich countries that accounts for about 60% of global gdp fell by close to one percentage point Joblessness in the euro area hit an all-time low Consumer spending was strong with hotels planes and restaurants packed the world over Now reality has caught up with the rhetoric Higher borrowing costs are starting to bite In many countries including Canada and New Zealand house prices are falling as homebuyers face expensive mortgages Housebuilders are cancelling projects and homeowners are feeling less wealthy Other companies are also reining in spending In their latest monetary-policy report the Bank of England researchers note that costlier finance is “weighing on investment intentions” The minutes of a recent Federal Reserve meeting observe that fixed investment by businesses has “already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions” Deteriorating economic conditions are beginning to show up in “real-time” data Goldman Sachs a bank publishes a “current-activity indicator” a month-by-month measure of economic strength Last month for the first time since the initial covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 rich-world economies appeared to shrink see chart 3 Likewise a global survey of purchasing managers indicates a contraction for the first time since June 2020 Since July a “nowcast” of global annualised gdp growth produced by JPMorgan Chase another bank has fallen by half Optimists point to strong labour markets America formidable jobs machine has slowed but is still whirring adding more than 250000 positions in October Elsewhere though signs of weakness are emerging Claudia Sahm an economist has suggested that a recession is nigh when the average of the unemployment rate over the past three months rises by at least 05 percentage points relative to its low during the previous year We find that eight out of 31 rich countries currently meet this criterion including Denmark and the Netherlands This is not a high proportion compared with say the beginning of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 But it does signal that a serious slowdown is now under way The “Sahm rule” reveals another important truth: that different countries are moving at very different speeds Aside from America a number of places including Australia and Spain are still growing at a decent rate Yet others are in trouble Sweden where high interest rates are hurting a particularly frothy housing market is losing steam fast Britain is now almost certainly in recession In Germany sky-high energy prices are forcing industrial shutdowns It may be faring the worst of all rich countries How severe will the downturn be? Households in rich countries are still sitting on trillions of dollars of “excess savings” which they accumulated in 2020-21 from stimulus cheques and other fiscal support This money will allow them to continue spending even in the face of falling real incomes New research by Goldman Sachs finds that large private-sector saving surpluses are associated with less severe recessions And healthy savings pots mean economic pain is less likely to translate into financial distress Mortgage-delinquency rates are actually declining in America and are extremely low in New Zealand and Canada Marching ordersLabour markets are weakening but a rise in unemployment like that seen after the financial crisis is unlikely This is because demand for labour has a long way to fall before it matches supply Early this year the two were seriously out of whack with the number of unfilled vacancies across the oecd peaking at 30m according to our calculations Now as demand falls vacancies rather than jobs seem once again to be taking the strain We estimate that the number of unfilled positions has fallen by a tenth since the high but the number of filled posts is static Much depends on the path of inflation Central banks are willing to induce a recession in order to lower it Higher rates may bring “some softening of labour-market conditions” as Jerome Powell the chairman of the Fed noted earlier this month “We do think that [raising rates] is going to dampen demand we’re not going to pretend this is pain-free” warns Philip Lane chief economist of the European Central Bank Both economic theory and data over the past seven decades suggest that falling gdp is associated with a large decline in the speed of price rises But the lags between tighter monetary policy and lower inflation are not well understood Central banks may have to cause more pain than they anticipateIn some countries lower energy and food prices are helping to drag down the headline rate of inflation America recent figures for October were better than economists expected In general though prices are not heading in the direction that central bankers would like Inflation “surprises” across the rich world when reported data come in higher than forecast are still common see chart 4 According to figures released on November 16th inflation in Britain was 111% in October well above economists’ expectations On the same day Canadian data showed no sign of waning inflation Almost everywhere “core” inflation which reflects underlying price pressure better is rising In three dimensionsbreadth wages and expectationsrich-world inflation is getting more not less entrenched Begin with breadth When the inflationary surge started last year it was confined in most countries to a small number of goods and services In America it was second-hand cars In Japan it was food In Europe it was energy This provided false comfort to pundits many of whom assumed that once the prices of these few components stopped rising overall inflation would fizzle out In fact the inflation virus has spread We analysed the consumer baskets of 36 mostly rich countries In June 60% of prices in the median basket were rising by more than 4% year on year Now 67% are Even in Japan the land of low inflation the prices of a third of the basket are rising by more than 4% This broadening out is in part due to an exceptionally strong dollar which raises inflation by making imports more expensive But it is more to do with what is happening in domestic economiesThis is where the second dimensionwagescomes in Pay is a guide to the future path of inflation: when companies’ labour costs rise they tend to pass them on to customers in the form of higher prices Inflation optimists point to data from America where there is some evidence of a pay slowdown albeit from increases of 6% or more year on year Growth in Britain also seems to have peaked at a high-but-no-longer-rising rate Elsewhere though there is not much evidence of restraint New research from Pawel Adrjan of Indeed a jobs website and Reamonn Lydon of the Central Bank of Ireland suggests that nominal pay in euro-zone job postings is rising by more than 5% year on year and is still accelerating French wage inflation “has further to go” reckons JPMorgan In Germany ig Metall a big union for metals and engineering workers is seeking a pay rise of up to 8% In New Zealand Norway and Sweden pay growth is still rising This is not what you would expect at a time when the economic outlook is dire The third dimension is expectations Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy runs millions of news articles in several languages through a model to construct a “news inflation pressure index” The index which has proved to be a good predictor of official numbers is still elevated Similar evidence comes from Google-search data which suggests that global interest in inflation has never been so high Survey-based measures of expectations similarly provide no evidence of weakening inflation Figures put together by the Cleveland Fed Morning Consult a data company and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University gauge the public inflation expectations in various rich countries According to the survey for October in the median country the public reckons prices will rise by 5% over the next year as it has in previous months see chart 5 The inflation expectations of companiesthe economic actors that actually set pricesare just as concerning A survey by the Cleveland Fed based on research by Bernardo Candia Olivier Coibion and Yuriy Gorodnichenko three economists finds that American firms currently expect inflation of 7% over the next year the highest level since the survey began in 2018 Painful ignoranceEveryone can agree on one thing about the past year It has demonstrated just how poorly economists understand inflation including both what causes it and what causes it to persist It is likely therefore that economists will also struggle to predict when inflation will cool Optimists hope that prices will once again take people by surprise with their rise slowing sooner than expected But it seems more likely that inflation will prove stubborn even as the economy slows That will leave policymakers with a grim choice: to squeeze the economy tighter and tighter or to let prices spiral For more expert analysis of

 Nov 14th 2022,A radical shift in China property and pandemic policies,For almost three years China policymakers have been fighting a two-front war: against a virulent pandemic and a volatile property market Their chosen policy instruments have turned out to be double-edged “Zero-covid” mass-testing and hair-trigger lockdowns have saved lives at great cost to the economy Tough curbs on property developers have stopped overborrowing but also led to dozens of defaults and a prolonged slowdown in one of the country biggest drivers of growthIn recent days China policymakers have signalled a tactical retreat on both fronts On November 11th officials released 20 measures adjusting zero-covid policies to make them a little less onerous and costly to administer On November 13th China central bank and banking regulator circulated 16 measures to relieve the credit crunch in the property industry restart construction on stalled projects and prevent a fresh wave of defaults Together the measures amount to the biggest shift in Chinese policymaking in years The Hang Seng China Enterprise index of mainland firms listed in Hong Kong is up by 21% so far this month Another index tracking Chinese developers rose by 13% on November 14th alone The covid-19 measures include a reduction in the quarantine time for incoming travellers and an end to the “circuit breaker” which suspends airlines that inadvertently carried infected passengers People at two degrees of separation from a covid-carrier “close contacts of close contacts” will no longer need to quarantine And close contacts must now spend a mere five days rather than seven in a quarantine facility plus another three confined to their homesThe 20 steps are not necessarily a prelude to the abandonment of China zero-covid policythey may just be a refinement of it Indeed with infections rising including in big cities like Guangzhou China may see more lockdowns in the immediate future rather than fewer But the 20 steps still represent the biggest relaxation of the country pandemic stance since covid began to spreadLikewise the 16 measures for the property market represent “the most crucial pivot” in China housing policies since policymakers’ hawkish turn last summer according to Ting Lu of Nomura a bank Back then regulators began rigorously enforcing limits on the amounts developers could borrow and banks could lend Their aim was to kill the property market speculative momentum and cut the sector down to size They succeeded all too well Developers fell into default or distress construction halted on pre-sold projects homebuyers’ confidence collapsed and sales plunged Housing is for living in not for speculation China government insists But unfinished flats are bad for bothJust as last year curbs tightened access to financing these measures loosen it They are intended to increase lending to viable developers and construction firms avert a fresh wave of loan or bond defaults finance the resumption of construction on stalled projects and ease the plight of mortgage-holders Developers’ loans due in the next six months should be extended Bonds should be renegotiated Regulators will also guarantee new bonds issued by viable developers including private-sector firms China state-directed “policy banks” will help finance stalled housing projects and any commercial banks that lend alongside them will receive favourable regulatory treatment Banks will be instructed to be lenient when rescheduling mortgages secured against unfinished flats or owed by individuals thrown into difficulties by covid Success is far from guaranteed The measures envision local governments state-owned asset-management firms and commercial banks working together to restructure distressed developers without providing a template for this financial choreography Nor are the 16 measures the government first attempt to revive the property sector Indeed they include several steps that have already been taken In August it was announced that two policy banks would lend 200bn yuan $28bn to help finish housing projects A similar announcement a month later said that six state-owned banks would lend 600bn yuan in the last three months of this year It was also previously revealed that China regulators will help private firms issue up to 250bn yuan of bondsTogether the measures old and new should help developers meet existing obligations But will it help them sell new properties? When access to finance slams shut sales quickly suffer When it reopens sales do not necessarily revive It will take time for stalled projects to be finished especially if the developer must first be restructured It will also take time for a steady flow of completions to restore confidence And even when buyers feel sure that a flat they buy will be built they may not feel confident enough to actually purchase one given declines in house prices and the weakness of an economy prone to lockdownsInvestors have welcomed the combined 36 steps policymakers are taking to revive growth But much remains uncertain not least how officials will react to widespread covid outbreaks next year It may be that China cannot truly revive home sales until it takes further steps to live with the disease If that is the case the 20 steps on covid may be just as important a signal to the housing market as the 16 steps on property 
 Nov 13th 2022,Markets are suddenly exuberant Are they right to be?,WITH THE inflation crisis well into its second year a few words have cemented their place in the lexicon of investors There were the subsequently much-derided predictions of a “transitory” problem There were also the accurate forecasts of interest-rate “front-loading” by central banks and more recently grumbling about the belatedly “expeditious” manner in which America Federal Reserve has approached tightening Attention now is on the concept of the “head fake”: the notion that a rosy batch of data suggestive of receding inflation can fuel a burst of optimism in markets only for the dreary reality of persistent price pressures to reassert itselfAt the tail end of last week beleaguered asset prices soared buoyed by America latest inflation numbers Stocks rallied around the world The NASDAQ America tech-heavy benchmark climbed by nearly 10% on November 10th and 11th its strongest two-day rally in more than a decade Beaten-down currencies such as the pound and yen also rebounded Economists had expected America consumer price index CPI for the month of October to increase by 06% from a month earlier Instead according to figures released on November 10th it rose by 04% That is a small difference in the grand scheme of things On an annualised basis it equates to inflation of nearly 5% well above the Fed target of roughly 2% But investors were quick to extrapolate to the possibility that maybejust maybeinflation grip on the American economy was weakening Almost instantly traders revised down their estimates for the peak of interest rates Before the release many thought the Fed would lift rates to 55% by the middle of 2023 Now bond yields suggest 5% is more likely That would have all kinds of positive consequences It would reduce the likelihood of a crushing recession in America and beyond ease the pressure on other countries’ central banks to keep pace with the Fed and boost the prices of risky assets especially stocks Hence the question about whether the data amount to a head fake After all investors were burned in autumn last year when inflation briefly appeared to top out and again this July when they concluded prematurely that the Fed was going to reduce the intensity of its tightening On both occasions market rallies fizzled out in short orderIs this time different? The case that price relief is finally at hand rests on two pillars First a wide array of products appear to have moved towards deflation The prices of core goodsexcluding volatile food and energy itemsfell by 04% month on month in October Some of this reflects the unwinding of pandemic-era price surges such as those for used cars But declines were broad: household furnishings clothing and school supplies all got cheaper And retailers report higher inventories and somewhat softer consumer demand The net effect appears to be a long-awaited decline in goods pricesThe second pillar is a tantalising hint that prices for services are also heading in the right direction The single biggest driver of services inflationthe cost of housinglooks like it is losing a little oomph The most important factor in determining housing costs in CPI is rents which accounted for more than half of the increase in core inflation in the past few months In October rents rose by 07% month on month down from 08% in September That is significant because it suggests official estimates are tracking in the same direction as higher frequency private-sector gauges which have shown deceleration in rental inflation for nearly half a year A basic difference in methodology explains the gap: private-sector gauges look at the asking price for properties on the market whereas the official measure looks at rents actually paid by tenants including those on existing often cheaper leases Allowing for that long lag rents may be on the cusp of becoming a force for disinflation in the CPIParadise postponedA reality check is useful however As the experience of the past year shows monthly figures can be noisy And the fundamental problem in America is excessive demand relative to supply This is now most acute in the labour market where extremely high job vacancies underpin hefty wage increases To rein in inflation the labour market needs to cool The economy is well past the point of being able to enjoy disinflation without collateral damage It is theoretically possible companies could pare back their hiring without pushing huge numbers onto the dole Yet some increase in unemployment seems inevitable and for the Fed even desirable What is more the stock rally is unwelcome from the Fed point of view Markets are the primary transmission belt for monetary policy A large increase in stock prices represents a loosening of financial conditions which if sustained would make it easier for companies to obtain credit running counter to the central bank efforts Fed officials are deeply versed in the history of the 1970s when America struggled with double-digit inflation and when central bankers erred by relaxing policy as soon as pressures started to easesomething that allowed inflation to roar backJerome Powell the Fed chairman is determined to avoid a similar mistake At a press conference on November 2nd after the latest rate rise he said no fewer than four times that the Fed still has some “ways to go” That ought to serve as a warning for investors suddenly giddy with optimism Even if the lower-than-expected inflation reading does mark a turning point in America battle against inflation it will be a gradual turn not a sharp reversal

Some stocks including Amazon and Netflix remain expensive on favoured measures Other smaller ones including PayPal and Zoom may attract interest So might two giants Alphabet with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 looks cheaper than most value stocks Meta which currently trades at just nine times earnings and two times book value might have piqued even Graham interest Tech investors have long been conscious of having paid a lot for their shares but hoped these valuations would be justified in the long-run The fact that many tech stocks now qualify as value stocks will come as a considerable blow Perhaps the idea that value investing and tech stocks are inherently incompatible was simplistic Modern value investing is practised by all sorts including a number of quantitative investors such as Cliff Asness at aqr Capital Management who crunch vast data sets to compare firms against wide and varied measures of their worth Rather than comparing the results with arbitrary criteria across all kinds of firms they instead tend to compare them within industries But one thing remains true regardless of the sophistication of the analysis Tech stocks today are much better value than they were at the start of the yearRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Financiers’ pronouncements on China do not match their actions Nov 3rdThe surprising maturity of the crypto-rave crowd Oct 27thCan Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Nov 10th 2022,Interest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?,For a few months this year there was a rare moment of economic consensus The rich world central banks especially America Federal Reserve had uncaged inflation They had to correct the error by raising interest rates sharply and swiftly Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut as 2022 draws to a close the uneasy peace between doves and hawks has broken down Their latest disagreement about monetary policy is so big it is as if they are working with different sets of facts While some economists warn that interest rates have now risen by more than is necessary to contain price growth others say that monetary policy has not really tightened at all Like fixing a dislocated shoulder sorting an inflation problem is supposed to be painful yet simple Every economist knows the maxim dubbed the “Taylor principle” after John Taylor of Stanford University which tells central bankers to raise interest rates by more than inflation has gone up To disregard the rule is to allow inflation-adjusted borrowing costs to fall administering a stimulus that makes the problem worse To follow the principle policymakers must raise real rates every time prices accelerate If they do sooner or later the economy will slow and order will be restored The Taylor principle is necessary to stabilise inflation in state-of-the-art economic models It is also common senseYet today no major central bank is following the principle Since the start of last year inflation has risen by five percentage points in America eight points in Britain and ten points in the euro zone Central banks’ interest-rate rises are rapid by historical standards But they are nowhere close to keeping pace with this price growth And that has led some economists to ring the alarm bell “The Fed has not yet hit the brakes” declared Jonathan Parker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after the latest bumper 075-percentage-point increase on November 2nd The trouble is that although the Taylor principle makes sense in theory there is disagreement about how to apply it in practice A true measure of real interest rates is forward-looking New borrowers and lenders need to know what inflation will be in the future not what it was in the past According to a survey by the New York Fed consumers expect inflation of 54% over the next year Mr Parker subtracts this from the Fed target interest-rate range of 375-4% to get a negative real interest rate of about -15% That is below the prevailing rate before the covid-19 pandemic and “very very not contractionary” he saysBut why only look forward one year? Many loans are provided over a longer time frame And here lies the doveish calculation Greg Mankiw of Harvard University worries that the Fed may be overdoing things because the five-year real interest rate priced into financial markets has risen sharply since the start of last year by 34 percentage points at the time of writing The textbook version of the Taylor rule a more expansive cousin of the Taylor principle says that real interest rates should go up by half the increase in inflation Look five years ahead in financial markets and take a measure of underlying inflationMr Mankiw points to a three-point rise in annual wage growthand real rates have roughly kept pace with inflation In other words the Fed tightening looks like too much rather than too littleThe argument relies on what economists call “rational expectations” The public view about what a central bank might do tomorrow is in theory just as important as today short-term interest rates As a result in modern economic models it does not matter much if policymakers fail to raise interest rates above inflation at a given point in time notes Michael Woodford of Columbia University Only the expectation of a systematic disregard for the Taylor principle “indefinitely into the future” would cause monetary mayhem And the Fed policymakers are hardly showing this sort of disregard The central bank is not done raising interest rates: markets expect them to rise above 5% next year That could be enough to satisfy the Taylor principle by thenA belief that expectations are rational is usually associated with a conservative hawkish view of the world in which people belong to the species Homo economicus Today these arguments help doves who argue that central banks should calm down The Fed boasts that it has turned the real interest rates that are priced into financial markets positive at almost all horizons The worst case of a yield curve having slipped away from a central bank control is in Britainbut ironically the problem is that markets seem to expect more interest-rate increases than the Bank of England would like At its latest meeting the central bank forecast that the path for rates envisaged by markets would result in a deep recession and bring inflation well below target It is almost as if the Bank of England has too much inflation-fighting credibilityEven if the Taylor principle is being met on a forward-looking basis that is not the end of the story The principle prescribes only the minimum tightening that is needed to bring inflation to heel Were central banks only narrowly to clear the hurdle then inflation could take a long time to return to target Another issue is that interest rates are supposed to rise still higher when an economy is overheating America where there are almost two job openings for every unemployed worker clearly has this problem Failing to respond to it could prolong the inflationary episodeFrom first principlesPerhaps the best argument for more rate rises though is the poor record of both economic models and financial markets at predicting inflation Over the past year both have persistently underestimated its rise In an uncertain environment it makes sense to put more weight on data and less on forecastsa point central bankers have begun to emphasise Following the Taylor principle with respect to realised inflation might make policymakers slow to react to a change in the economic winds But that is a price worth paying to be sure of bringing inflation under control Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How best to bring back manufacturing Nov 3rdHow to escape scientific stagnation Oct 27thWhy inflation refuses to go away Oct 19th

Two stories circulated both a touch Shakespearean The first is one of rivalry and the second of hubris Start with the rivalry between Mr Bankman-Fried and Mr Zhao Mr Bankman-Fried owns three firms: ftx a global exchange; ftxus an American exchange; and Alameda Research a crypto-trading fund In theory these are separate entities But the connection between Alameda and ftx has long been unclear On November 2nd CoinDesk a news website reported that tokens issued by ftx made up two-fifths of Alameda assets and were worth $58bn That sum was almost double the market capitalisation of the tokens and a slice was marked as collateral raising concerns that Alameda had borrowed against them possibly from ftx itself Apparently in response Mr Zhao tweeted he would liquidate Binance holdings of ftx tokens then worth over half a billion dollars That he later moved to snap up the firm led many to believe he had orchestrated the chaoscasting doubt on ftx in order to set off a fire sale It seemed a plausible story There is little love lost between Mr Bankman-Fried and the less-celebrated Mr Zhao The Binance boss has long claimed his firm is headquartered “nowhere” It is banned from providing some services in countries including Britain owing to a lack of information about compliance with regulations Mr Bankman-Fried has reportedly goaded Mr Zhao about this But the apparent size of the hole in ftx balance-sheet indicates problems ran far deeper than a rival starting rumours The details of what went wrong in the beanbag-strewn offices of ftx and Alameda are not yet clear An exchange which sits between buyer and seller and takes a spread should not be an easy business to bankrupt It is not typically exposed to runs since it merely holds assets on behalf of investors Problems can emerge though when such firms make loans allowing customers to buy “on margin” or lend out crypto tokens they hold on behalf of investors in exchange for collateral like cash or other tokens ftx seems to have allowed Alameda to borrow customers’ assets by posting ftx tokens issued by the exchange itself as collateral As ftx tokens fell in value the firm no longer had enough assets to cover the liabilities it owed to customers causing a downward spiral In coming up with its wealth estimates Bloomberg assumes both Alameda and ftx are now worth just $1 Sequoia a venture-capital firm has told investors it has written down its stake in the exchange to zero Reports on November 9th suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission America top financial regulator had months ago launched a probe into ftx handling of funds as well as the connections between Mr Bankman-Fried firms America Justice Department is also reported to be investigating the firm ftx has not yet commented on either storyThe fallout will have wider consequences The crypto winter had previously claimed only the types of victims that would be expected including a poorly designed stablecoin a hedge fund and several platforms that made risky loans That it has come for ftx a well-regarded business and Mr Bankman-Fried is an enormous blow It has left other institutions scrambling to reassure customers Coinbase a large exchange has sent out reassuring missives to the press Its share price has nevertheless shed a fifth of its value in recent days and is close to all-time lows The collapse of ftx may be enough to reverse the embrace of crypto by institutions ordinary folk and the occasional government Institutional investors including Temasek a Singaporean wealth fund; SoftBank a Japanese tech-investing group; and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan a Canadian fund had all dipped their toes into the industry by buying stakes in ftx Legislators will now eye crypto with even deeper suspicion Whatever the precise cause of ftx implosion the story is already a tragedy for the industry For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 9th 2022,Financial markets bet on an end to China “zero-covid” policy,Is China about to abandon its struggle with covid-19? Judging by recent moves in the markets you might think so Rumours that China had assembled a reopening committee inspired a big rally in the country shares the offshore yuan and even the price of copper in the early days of this month A social-media message that helped circulate the idea was subsequently dubbed the “trillion-dollar” tweet Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf nothing else the market movements were a reminder of the costs of China “zero-covid” strategy which requires mass testing and frequent lockdowns to stamp out the disease Few policies are so economically damaging that mere rumours of their repeal can create so much wealth so quickly A reopening could lift the value of China shares by 20% or $26trn according to Goldman Sachs a bank Because China is the only big economy still prone to lockdowns it is the last opportunity for investors to profit from a reopening rally These tend to happen early and fast which is why investors risk jumping the gunOptimists point out China is taking modest steps to become more open Its aviation regulator has more than doubled the international flights planned for the next few months compared with a year ago China may shorten the quarantine for incoming travellers and abandon the “circuit-breaker” which suspends airlines that bring in infected passengers International sports events are returning Shanghai eerily quiet during its lockdown in April and May will hear the growl of racing cars when Formula One returns in April 2023In September China approved an inhalable vaccine that is now being used in 14 cities At a private conference on November 4th a former official at its Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said that “substantive changes” in the country approach were likely in the next six months according to Reuters a news agencyBut if China is preparing to exit preparations will be lengthy It will first want to suppress small but widespread outbreaks in more than 100 cities including Guangzhou the capital of Guangdong a province with a gdp as big as South Korea It will then want to keep a lid on infections through winter so as not to overtax its hospitals And it will presumably take no big decisions until new officials are installed at the National People Congress in MarchBefore it can reopen with any confidence China will need to stockpile antiviral drugs It will also have to build more intensive-care units and crucially lift the vaccination rate among its elderly The vaccination rate is a “leading indicator” of reopening reckons Citigroup another bank The share of people aged 60 or above who have received a booster shot reached 66% earlier this year before plateauing Some wonder if China is waiting for more effective home-grown jabs before renewing its immunisation drive It is also possible that Chinese officials do not want to prod the elderly to get another jab until they know reopening is on the way The protection conferred by even the best shots wanes So there are dangers in vaccinating people too soon as well as too little As it happens the percentage of boosted elderly increased to 685% in November If it continues to climb speculation about a reopening will intensifyThe economy could grow by 55-6% in the event of an orderly reopening according to the Economist Intelligence Unit our sister company Grimmer scenarios are possible: a chaotic end to the “zero-covid” regime could cause the economy to shrink for a quarter before a subsequent recovery For this reason whenever it begins the pace of reopening is likely to be cautiousAlthough many will feel relief as controls are relaxed others will be worried It will take a concerted propaganda effort to dispel the stigma the disease now carries meaning consumer confidence may rise only slowly On November 6th vaccinated competitors took part in the Beijing marathon the first for two years running over 26 miles from Tiananmen Square to the “Bird Nest” Olympic stadium The route to reopening could be just as arduous For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub
 Nov 8th 2022,Economic growth no longer means higher carbon emissions,If anywhere can claim to be the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution it is Coalbrookdale a pretty village in England West Midlands In 1709 Abraham Darby a local merchant leased a foundry and fed the furnace with coking coal rather than charcoal made from wood The use of the fossil fuel meant he could make pig iron much more cheaply and cast it into pots pans and cauldrons for cookingthe kind of low-cost manufactured goods that would over the next three centuries produce an unprecedented rise in living standards across the worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDarby furnace was not just ground zero for the Industrial Revolution It was also ground zero for global warming Since the fateful smelting economic output and greenhouse-gas emissions have risen in tandem England furnaces were joined by coal-powered railways and steam-powered textile mills all using tools cast from coke-fuelled foundries Between the middle of the 19th century and the outbreak of the first world war Britain national income per person more than doubled and its carbon emissions increased four-fold When other countries industrialised their emissions spiralled tooAs politicians gather in Sharm el-Sheikh an Egyptian holiday resort to review progress on climate change at cop27 there is at least one cause for optimism: the historic link between rising prosperity and carbon emissions has been broken Today Britain is a member of a large and growing group of rich and middle-income countries that has severed it This decoupling has been achieved not through the large-scale deployment of renewable energyor indeed by exporting emissions to poorer countriesbut by a change in the relationship between economic growth and energy that is perhaps as significant as those first stirrings of the Industrial Revolution three centuries agoAll told some 33 countries have in recent years cut emissions while maintaining growth Around three-fifths are European meaning as was the case during the Industrial Revolution the old continent is leading the way But the group also includes America where emissions fell by 15% between 2007 and 2019 even as gdp per person rose by 23% as well as others that have joined more recently These include Australia where emissions have fallen by 9% since peaking in 2012 and Israel where they have fallen by 12% in the same period even as both economies have grownIt would be wrong however to characterise decoupling as a luxury reserved for the most affluent countries Thanks to energy-efficiency improvements emissions in eastern Europe have fallen since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the same time as living standards have converged with western Europe Argentina Mexico and Uruguay have also joined the decouplers In Mexico for instance emissions have fallen by 16% since their peak in 2012 Around the world before the covid-19 pandemic distorted the numbers more than 1bn people lived in countries with falling emissions and growing economiesTerritorial emissions which reflect domestic production began to fall much earlier In Britain they peaked in the 1970s before oil shocks and strikes decimated the country industry But their decline merely reflected the fact that more manufacturing was taking place abroad: British clothes were being sewn in Dhaka instead of Derby which led to no reduction in global emissions The figures in this article mostly come from analysis of data produced by the Global Carbon Project a greenhouse-gas-monitoring outfit These include estimates of the emissions from imports and so capture the vast majority of a country carbon footprint In other words Britain figures include emissions from imported t-shirts made in BangladeshThe more recent decline in emissions is therefore the real deal Part of the explanation is that the countries to which manufacturing has been outsourced now emit less carbon themselves notes Viktoras Kulionis of Pictet Asset Management In all but a couple of dozen industrialising countries gdp growth produces fewer carbon emissions than used to be the case a phenomenon which is known as “relative decoupling” In 2008 China exported emissions peaked at around 15bn tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent before falling to 1bn in 2019 owing to improved efficiency and a move from chemicals and metals exports to less carbon-intensive electronics ones Emissions imported by the oecd group of mostly rich countries peaked in 2006 at 2bn tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent They have since fallen by more than a third to 13bnBut the shift mostly reflects a watershed change in how energy is used in the West Decoupling can occur for two reasons: either because output becomes less energy-intensive or because the energy used becomes greener For the past decade or so it has mostly happened because of the former The energy intensity of gdpthe supply needed to produce a dollar of national incomehas fallen faster than gdp has grown This can be seen in America The country is often considered a polluter par excellence In fact its territorial emissions peaked in 2005 Since then the energy intensity of its gdp has fallen by nearly a quarter So even though America gdp has risen by 29% emissions have fallen by 15% Similarly four-fifths of the fall in German emissions since 1990 reflects lower energy intensity Only the remaining fifth comes from the use of greener energyFalling energy intensity is the result of changes to the structure of rich-world economies A visitor to Coalbrookdale in the 18th century compared its smoke heat and fire to a vision of hell Nowadays the old furnace lies cold; the last foundry which made parts for Aga ovens closed in 2017; and the site has become a tourist attraction It is a symbol of Britain shift from an industrial economy to a service-based economya shift which has big implications for emissions As Nick Eyre a climate-policy expert at the University of Oxford notes an extra trip to the theatre requires much less energy than making additional pots and pansThe move from manufacturing to services has happened across the rich world Industry share of American gdp fell from 17% in 2007 to 14% by 2019 In Germany a country known for its manufacturing prowess its share fell by two percentage points in the same period Even in Mexico one of the poorer countries to have decoupled its share dropped from 27% to 25% The task now is to accelerate decoupling One reason for optimism is that so far it has happened without colossal outlays or much political consensus Many of the West high achievers have emissions-trading schemes or other forms of carbon pricing but even laggards have managed to reduce their carbon footprints Increasing use of renewables in electricity generation as well as electrifying the heating of homes and transportwhether through electric cars or encouraging public transporthas the potential to make a big difference But perhaps the greatest reason for optimism is the evidence that poorer countries are industrialising in different ways from their predecessors Data from the Global Carbon Project suggest that Egypt the cop27 host reached peak emissions in 2017 India and Vietnam which are becoming a bigger source of exports as trade shifts away from China are considerably greener than their economic rival In 2007 when China economy was roughly as big as India is today it emitted around twice as much carbon dioxide India and Vietnam are still powered by coal The difference is they are making much more efficient use of it For more

 Nov 6th 2022,Who wins from the unravelling of Sino-American trade?,From disease and downturn to the deterioration in Chinese-American relations there has been no let-up to the blows battering the world trading system The latest threat stems from the possibility of another global recession Only two years after the world sank into a covid-induced slump shipping bosses are again warning of grim prospects for international trade Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven beyond the ups and downs of the economic cycle deeper shifts in global trade are taking place Firms are reconsidering their production decisions and governments are pushing the process along Such shifts might have seemed outlandish in 2018 when Donald Trump then America president first slapped tariffs on imported Chinese goods Since then a pandemic has struck and President Joe Biden has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technology to China and plans to provide subsidies worth hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in domestic manufacturing A rejigging of trade now feels inevitable rather than unimaginableand the outline of its new geography is becoming clearerGlobal trade in goods staged an impressive bounceback after the covid-19 downturn in 2020 As a share of world gdp its value last year rose to the highest level since 2014 But not all trade routes are flourishing When Mr Trump took his protectionist turn there was hope that economies in Africa and Latin America might attract some of the business that would have otherwise flowed to China Instead the biggest winners from changing trade patterns are to be found in AsiaGlobal trade data emerge slowly Figures on imports to big economies are therefore the best way to get an up-to-date picture of what is happening According to American data released on November 3rd the country imports have risen by a third since 2018 Gains though have been unevenly distributed American imports of Chinese goods stand just 6% above four years ago a hefty decline in China market share since President Trump launched his trade war America imports from the eu have also grown in lacklustre fashion up by just 12% since 2018 “Friendshoring” may be happening but not on a grand scale Imports from Canada and Mexico have risen by 39% and 34% respectivelyThe great champions of the past four years are in Asia Exports to America from Bangladesh and Thailand have jumped by more than 80% since 2018; exports from Vietnam are up by more than 170% see chart India and Indonesia have seen their exports grow by more than 60% As a result China share of American imports dropped by four percentage points between 2018 and 2022 from 21% to 17% China used to account for nearly half of Asia exports to America; now it accounts for just over a thirdNor is this simply an American trend China is also importing more from Asia Over the first nine months of this year the share of China imports coming from America fell by two percentage points compared with the same period in 2018 The share coming from the eu declined by a similar amount On the other hand the Association of South-East Asian Nations asean a regional club of ten countries saw its share of China imports grow by two percentage points European trade figures are less up-to-date but Asia rise is also visible in them Although the share of eu imports arriving from China increased last year so did those from South and South-East Asia Neither China nor Europe saw a comparable rise in imports from other regions of the worldCultivating new sources of goods or components takes time and investment so the shift in trade patterns now visible in the data mostly reflects choices firms made well before this year geopolitical ructions Some redistribution of trade would have happened even in placid economic conditions Rising labour costs in China for instance would have made it attractive to move low-value sorts of manufacturingin textiles and apparel sayto places like Bangladesh However Mr Trump tariffs seem to have played an important role According to recent analysis of industry data by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank China share of America imports rose from 36% to 39% this year in goods not covered by tariffs For goods subject to a 75% tariff however China share sank from 24% to 18% And for those hit by a whopping 25% tariff which covers lots of it equipment China share of imports fell from 16% to 10% Overall America is now much less dependent on Chinese goods from furniture to semiconductorsThis change is more nuanced than it appears at first glance It seems likely that many of the components used to make goods in India or Vietnam are themselves produced in China Although the detailed supply-chain data needed to say for sure will not be published for several years Chinese export figures are certainly suggestive The two-percentage-point drop in the share of China total exports destined for America over the period from 2018 to 2022 is exactly matched by the increase in China exports to asean economiesThe story so far seems to be one in which Asia emerging economies increasingly intermediate trade between China and the rich world Dreams that supply chains draped across Latin America and Africa would remake the world economic geography are still nothing more than dreams But this direction of travel is an unalloyed boon for a rapidly growing arc of countries stretching from India to the Philippines In time as the consequences of recent geopolitical developments accumulate an ever larger share of the value in Asian supply chains may concentrate outside of China rather than within it For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,Europe energy crisis is very far from over,IN MID-OCTOBER off the Spanish coast a number of slow-moving metallic domes emerged on the skyline They were tankers pregnant with superchilled liquefied natural gas LNG and awaiting delivery at busy “regasification” terminals where their liquid fuel is turned to gas before being transferred across the continent Iberia has the biggest facilities in Europe but congestion is building elsewhere too The amount of LNG off European shores has hit 12m tonnes according to Kpler a data firm up from 140000 in August At least the crews have beautiful weather in which to relax Across Europe temperatures are unseasonably warm: southern Spain is still seeing days above 30°CListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis combination of plentiful gas and warm weather which reduces demand for the stuff is a nightmare for Vladimir Putin and has led some optimists to declare that an end to Europe energy crisis is in sight For months Russia has sought to sow division in Europe and undermine support for Ukraine: first by demanding payment for gas in roubles; then by slashing flows through Nord Stream its main pipeline to the continent; and then in September by shutting the conduit indefinitely By paying over the odds Europe has nevertheless managed to fill its storage facilities As a result gas prices have sunk to $39 per million British thermal units from $100 in August Meanwhile Brent crude the oil benchmark sits at $95 per barrel below the $139 peak it hit in March Yet to declare an end to the crisis is premature Prices will rise as cold spells hit and other LNG buyers particularly in Asia compete for cargoes Russia faced with military setbacks could crank up the pressure further Mr Putin options include stopping all gas deliveries to Europe or vandalising infrastructure Such measuresor the use of a tactical nuclear weaponwould trigger another wave of sanctions from the West To understand how the energy war might develop The Economist has worked with modellers at Rystad Energy a consultancy Our analysis suggests that complacency is dangerous Things could get very bad very fastWe have simulated three scenarios Even the first under which relations do not deteriorate is far from pleasant It assumes that the Nord Stream pipeline remains shut It also assumes that Europe follows plans to implement an embargo on Russian crude and prohibit local insurance firms which have 90% of the global shipping market from covering vessels carrying Russian oilalbeit with a big exemption Non-Western buyers that agree to pay a capped price for Russia oil set by America and the EU are due to be allowed to purchase European insurance For Europe this scenario triggers a crisis but not a catastrophe Supply cuts mean that by the end of 2022 the continent will have missed out on 84bn cubic metres bcm of Russian gas equivalent to 17% of its normal annual consumption Higher LNG imports have already plugged part of this hole A smaller chunk is filled by greater piped flows from Azerbaijan and Norway and another by painful but voluntary consumption cuts Our simulation suggests thateven if the winter turns frigid boosting demand by 25 bcmEurope storage will allow it to get through the summer of 2023 by which point LNG imports may start to ramp upUnder this scenario governments will not have to ration gas Europe will though have to pay dearly for it As Namit Sharma of McKinsey another consultancy notes high prices have already led to shutdowns in energy-hungry industries such as aluminium and ammonia If Nord Stream remains shut throughout 2023 Europe energy deficit will widen requiring even bigger cuts in consumption Gavekal a research firm estimates that a 1% drop in energy consumption in Germany or Italy reduces GDP by 05-1% It is hard to gauge the cost of this for Russia Its piped exports to Europe already down by four-fifths cannot easily be sold elsewhere Its pipeline to China the only serious alternative is too puny to handle big flows However the price for what it is able to sell would be much higher In theory the EU dual oil embargoes coupled with a price cap are a bigger threat to Russia oil exports the country real moneymaker But we assume as the market does that the cap will be watered down and Russia will find buyers for many barrels it is unable to sell to Europe Western officials are leaning towards a loosely policed cap set at near $60 a barrel Since our base case expects global prices to stay below $90 that would not make much difference to the price of Russian oil which currently trades at a 20-30% discount Spanner in the spigotThis explains why in such a scenario Russia pockets $169bn in oil revenues in 2023 barely less than the $179bn it earned in 2021 It and other market participants still incur increased transaction costs caused by longer tanker journeys smuggling shenanigans and other frictions Europe pays a hefty price Importing Russian seaborne barrels cost it $90bn in 2021 The replacement of these in 2023 would cost $116bnIn our second scenario “escalation” Russia lobs a few grenades It starts by shutting its pipeline through Ukraine one of the two conduits still open in the process depriving Europe of another 10-12 bcm a year The country leaders would claim a pretext such as the “leak” that halted flows through Nord Stream After all Gazprom its gas monopoly still wants to be seen as a supplier that respects contracts at least outside the West says Anne-Sophie Corbeau formerly of BP a British giantThis initial strike would not surprise traders many of whom have already discounted Ukrainian volumes Traders would be stunned however if Russia stopped supplying LNG to Europethe next step in this scenario These deliveries worth 20 bcm a year equivalent to half of Russia annual LNG exports have continued under the radar Russia would not want to lose them altogether if only because that would cause the global spot price to rocket hurting friendlyish countries such as India and Pakistan which struggle to compete with Europe for cargoes Thus we assume Russia would offer the supply to these countries at cut priceIn this scenario the West retaliates by giving its oil price cap more bite perhaps threatening Western infringers with huge penalties toughening checks and lowering the cap To counter the counter Russia persuades opec and its allies some 23 countries that produce 40% of the world crude to cut their monthly production target by 1m barrels per day b/d on top of a 2m b/d cut implemented in October Rystad model projects that at the end of this shoot-out Russia will emerge less bloody This is partly because the tighter cap provides non-Western countries with a greater incentive to build an alternative oil-trading system Giovanni Serio of Vitol a trading firm says G7-owned tankers are already being bought up by non-Western players often in Asia or the Middle East China and India which have sucked up most of Russia excess barrels thus far can probably self-insure their ships Other countries may tap the “black” trade where Russian oilferried on tankers with their transponders turned off transferred from ship to ship on the high seas or blended with other crudescannot be traced Although Russia would take a hit on its gas revenues its oil income would be resilient Our calculations suggest the country oil exports would fall in both 2023 and 2024 by 2m b/d compared with 2021 forcing it to curtail production by more than 15m b/d The tighter market would push Brent into the triple digits and there would only be a small contraction in demand This would allow Russia to make up for the volume shortfall Its oil-export revenues would remain remarkably steady at $170bn in 2023 before falling to $150bn the year after Europe meanwhile would face tens of billions of dollars in extra costs Our third “extreme” scenario assumes that Russia perhaps facing catastrophic losses on the battlefield no longer cares about money or keeping allies sweet and opts for all-out energy war It begins by shutting TurkStream its remaining gas link to Europe The pipeline mostly serves Russia-friendly countries such as Hungary and Turkey But terminating it leaves Europe short of another 15 bcm a year Then Russia decides to wreck Europe gas-import infrastructure This possibility once unthinkable has become rather less so after saboteurs bombed Nord Stream in September Our extreme scenario assumes that Russia manages to stop flows through Norway two largest pipelines robbing Europe of another 55 bcm in yearly supply This would be quite a move The pipelines are far from Russia and Western countries may consider it an attack on NATO Leaving aside potential military ramifications we assume that Western powers would respond with “secondary” sanctions threatening non-Western individuals or firms trading Russian oil with measures such as the loss of access to American dollars This forces banks and insurers everywhere to dump Russian business making embargoes far more effective The Kremlin retaliates by convincing OPEC to declare another 1m b/d cut to its output target It also chokes off exports through the CPC a pipeline that carries 12m b/d of mostly Kazakh oil but which ends at the Russian port of Novorossiysk where the fuel is loaded onto ships America in an attempt to dampen the oil price accelerates releases from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve Yet the reserve is not infinite notes Jason Bordoff an energy tsar under Barack Obama Having been raided for months it is already at its lowest level since 1984 Thus we assume OPEC could wait it out first cutting production and then raising it when the strategic reserve runs dryAt the end of all this extraordinary back-and-forth Russia would enjoy a pyrrhic victory Its oil exports which only the black market can absorb crater to 3m b/d or less for years Despite the huge global supply gap Brent rises to “just” $186 a barrel before falling to $151 in 2024 because oil demand is crushed Russia oil revenues plummet to $90bn or less Europe faces an excruciating squeeze It must fork out $250bn in 2023 and $200bn in 2024 merely to replace Russian barrels Its annual import-gas bill nears $1trn almost double our base-case scenario despite much lower incoming volumes Making up for the lost gas proves impossible Our simulation suggests that Europe storage empty by November 2023 would remain bare for the whole of 2024 Europe unpluggedEuropean solidarity would almost certainly break down worsening the continent misery A recent simulation by Germany economic ministry assessed what would happen if in February next year power utilities in the country south were to receive 50% less gas than normal many French nuclear reactors remained shut as they have been this year and coal plants faltered They concluded that the EU would have to distribute 91 hours of blackouts among its members Germany in panic mode might decide to cut electricity exports to France or stop gas flows to the Czech Republic and Slovakia Britain which has meagre storage facilities but big gas needs would be vulnerable This future-gazing has limitations It only considers the energy war leaving aside what will happen on the battlefield and in the broader economic conflict Huge unknowns from the weather to the durability of Ukraine military could tip the balance And nobody knows what might trigger a transition from one scenario to the next if only because that depends on what happens inside Mr Putin head Yet the simulation holds two clear lessons One is that in the ninth month of the energy stand-off Russia retains more options for escalation than the West It has already shut its main gas supply route to Europe but the bloc needs all it can get so cutting off the rest would still wreck havoc And whatever energy Europe buys from others must still pass through hubs and spokes that Russia at its rashest could try to destroy The other lesson is that embargoes will not drain Russia treasury at least until Europe is prepared to bear much more pain The more Russian fuel cannot get to market the more Europe has to pay to replace itwhile rising prices limit the Kremlin losses It is only when oil prices cannot go higher without destroying demand that Russia truly suffersCorrection November 4th 2022: An earlier version

 Nov 3rd 2022,The growing popularity of a strange form of debt diplomacy,Reality caught up with the Egyptian pound on October 27th Since Russia invaded Ukraine prompting foreign investors to flee risky assets the country central bank has burnt through its foreign reserves in a bid to keep the currency fixed against the dollar But last week officials agreed to float the poundthe first of several concessions to secure a $3bn loan from the imf The currency promptly fell off a cliff plunging to an all-time lowListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow Egypt faces the task of rebuilding its foreign reserves The country expected current-account deficit and debt repayments over the next 18 months are roughly the same as its $33bn of reserves Tapping international debt markets is out of the question Economic turmoil will ward off foreign investors Thus Cairo will probably turn to old friends in the Gulf Between October 2021 and March this year Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the uae lent Egypt $18bn to sit in its foreign reserves The imf reports that another package worth $5bn is in the works although it has not said where the money will be coming fromEgypt is not the only country reliant on this unusual form of foreign generosity In August Saudi Arabia renewed a $3bn deposit in Pakistan central bank It sits alongside a yuan-denominated offering from China worth $2bn And as Argentina struggles to keep the peso fixed against the dollar some 60% of its reserves come from a Chinese currency swap worth $23bnDepleted foreign reserves can become a central bankers’ nightmare Governments are left unable to make loan repayments withdrawals sometimes have to be limited and import controls introduced Basic goods shortages may follow In the worst-case scenario spooked foreign investors set off a currency crisis Deposits and swaps offer a quick fix The fine print of agreements tends to be kept hushed and interest rates low Officially Gulf lenders want their money back But renewals are common Given the speed with which Egypt and Pakistan have burnt through their reserves it is unclear whether they could return the funds if requiredWhen a deal is agreed the debtor suddenly gains a great deal more foreign liquidity For years Argentina yuan swap obscured the country rapidly declining pile of foreign funds But unlike Gulf lenders China attaches strict conditions to its money In some circumstances Argentine officials need China permission to use the cash Thus the imf says that although Argentina headline reserves are $39bn after deducting the swap lines and other adjustments the net figurewhich it focuses onis a rather less impressive $2bnInformal lending also becomes a problem if a friendship flounders In 2016 as Hezbollah an Iranian-backed militia gained ground in Lebanese politics Saudi Arabia signalled its displeasure by withdrawing deposits it had made in the country central bank Three years later pressure on foreign reserves contributed to Lebanon financial meltdown Egypt and Pakistan have in effect tied their foreign reserves to approval from the Gulf and Chinaa shaky basis for economic stabilityThe situation in Egypt may end up illustrating another problem with this sort of informal lending It is not entirely clear how the lenders’ deposits will be treated if the country defaults Their status would have to be tested during the restructuring process As Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank in New York notes this sets up the potential for a stand-off between donorsThe imf Egyptian loan on October 27th was more modest than expected and was dependent on additional bilateral funding Saudi Arabia loans were made earlier in the year when Egypt economic situation was not quite as dire Both sides now look keen to extract themselves from an awkward situation; neither wants to be on the hook for more big loans But nor do they want to lose their moneyor Egypt to go under As the two sides inch away checking the other is still in sight they will have to ensure Egypt does not collapse from beneath them For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,Financiers’ pronouncements on China do not match their actions,Hong Kong brands itself “Asia world city” a label that has been mostly deployed in mockery over the past three years of political suppression and pandemic-induced isolation Yet the city government would like to make the slogan true once again It had hoped the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit which welcomed financial bigwigs on November 2nd would advertise the once semi-autonomous city return to the world Instead the event turned into another symbol of the headaches facing Western investors in China Mainland bankers with whom chief executives would have hobnobbed could not attend without ten days of quarantine on their return home American lawmakers urged executives not to go citing China human-rights record Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina stockmarket offers another illustration of the forces battering once-optimistic investors Although it inched up slightly in recent days on unfounded rumours that China “zero covid” policy may soon come to an end the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index a basket of Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks is down by almost 40% this year The lack of any change of tone at the Communist Party Congress in mid-October led to the most recent lurch Warning lights elsewhere are also flashing red A deteriorating property market threatens to upend China economic-growth model Souring relations with America have led to new trade restrictions most recently on advanced chips Yet for much of the past decade big investment houses have made rosy predictions about Chinese stocks Speaking in Hong Kong Colm Kelleher the chairman of ubs said that global bankers were all “very pro-China” Last year analysts at Nomura a Japanese bank predicted that the 2020s would be “the decade to double down on Chinese equities” At around the same time BlackRock an investment firm suggested that allocations to China should be two to three times their current level of around 4% in major indices JPMorgan Chase long-term capital-market assumptions published in mid-2020 projected annual returns to domestic Chinese stocks of 8% over the next 15 yearsCould those firms have foreseen today difficulties or is that just the wisdom of hindsight? The pandemic and the Chinese government reaction to it was difficult to anticipate In 2016 Tim Atwill then at Parametric Portfolio Associates a provider of direct-indexing services was a lonely sceptic on the matter of including domestic Chinese stocks in the major emerging-market indices He argued that the broader industry was “blindly accepting a major allocation to a market that has shown little interest in the rights of foreign investors” The abolition of presidential term limits in 2018 when Xi Jinping began to entrench himself at the top of Chinese politics should have been a moment for introspection The direction of travel was abundantly clear by the time Mr Xi began to crack down on the country tech giants in 2020However the reality is that the bulls are rather less bullish than they appear at first glance Even many funds that in public wax lyrical about Chinese investment opportunities limit themselves to allocations to China of just a few percentage points Domestic Chinese shares are given an inclusion ratio of 20% by msci an index provider in its benchmark stock indices meaning that their presence is a fifth of what it would be at a full market weighting This discrepancy between ebullience in public and a more measured approach in practice reflects two realisations The first is that speaking out against China has unwanted consequences After JPMorgan issued a report in March saying that China was uninvestible the bank lost its position as a lead underwriter for a listing in Hong Kong of a Chinese cloud-computing firm The second realisation is that investing in China now comes with a serious tail risk attached: that investments could one day go to zero should Chinese politics go horribly wrong or tensions over Taiwan ratchet up to the extent that trade and financial links between China and the West are severed entirely True China could easily plod along Yet the risk even if relatively small of a nightmare scenario warrants a more modest asset allocationone that offers exposure to the mainland but does not have the potential to sink a portfolio if the worst comes to pass For all the efforts to suggest otherwise in Hong Kong it is the likelihood of disaster that will have been on everyone mind Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The surprising maturity of the crypto-rave crowd Oct 27thCan Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Nov 3rd 2022,Even recession may not bring down Europe inflation,It is difficult to spot the peak when hiking in the fog What is true in the Alps is just as true for policymakers who are struggling with inflation In the euro zone consumer prices in October were 107% higher than a year earlier The European Central Bank ecb has increased interest rates by 075% for the second meeting in a row as it dutifully follows the path trodden by America Federal Reserve Officials very much hope the peak is around the corner Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOptimists among them point out that the euro zone implemented no major fiscal stimulus after the covid-19 pandemic unlike America which means inflation has been driven by supply shocks and energy prices rather than an overheating economy Recent spending packages in Europe have sought to cushion the blow from eye-watering energy prices not stimulate spending In the second quarter of the year consumption was less than 2% above the same period in 2019 In America it was 7% Moreover sentiment indicators suggest the European economy is heading for recession Wages have grown moderately and there is little sign of a wage-price spiral Current and future energy prices on wholesale markets have fallen from summer peaks Bottlenecks affecting everything from microchips to furniture have eased Perhaps the peak really is nearby Sadly the optimism will probably prove unfounded Lower energy prices take time to feed through to consumers Most are still seeing whopping rises France has the lowest inflation in the bloc at 71% in October in part because the government has capped gas and electricity prices Next year however prices will be allowed to increase by 15% adding to inflation In Germany many households have long-term contracts that are gradually renewed to reflect higher pricesAnd though in the glowing sun of a warm October wholesale prices for energy dipped the medium-term forecast is for a cold and dry winter which means they will probably rise again Worse still Vladimir Putin may escalate the energy war Energy and food prices comprise less than a third of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation But the trends in the rest of the basket are also worrying Prices for services and goods other than food and energy increased by an annualised 6% over the past three months Although energy prices may lie behind part of this shiftrestaurants need heat for instancethe size of the increase suggests inflation is spreading As Chris Marsh of Exante a research firm notes the situation looks unfortunately similar to that in America a few months ago Wage rises are likely to add to inflation So far European pay has increased little Unlike in America six in ten workers have collective-bargaining agreements which tend to run for a year or moremeaning it takes time for economic conditions to influence their pay Trade-union negotiators have limited demands aware that a wage-price spiral would come back to haunt them But negotiators’ patience is beginning to wear thin Germany public-sector unions will enter forthcoming negotiations seeking a raise of 105%The problem for bosses is that the labour market remains exceptionally tight The share of firms reporting that staff shortages are limiting their production is near record highs in both the manufacturing and service sectors One reason is the enormous backlog of orders from the pandemic Manufacturing firms have on average more than five months of work on their order books according to a recent survey up from four before covid struck Add to that the cohort of workers retiring each year in ageing countries such as Italy and Germany and a recipe is in place for a tight labour market throughout 2023All of this means the peak in inflation is probably some way off Nor will there be much relief at the top for the descent will be similarly tricky to navigate Energy prices should settle at a lower level next year which will bring down headline inflation But inflation in the rest of the economy may still be accelerating limiting the immediate drop Thus the fog will remainEven a recession if people expect it to be brief may not tame inflation In that case the ecb would have to tighten the screws once again “The Bundesbank in the 1970s didn’t even flinch when the economy weakened They were successful in conquering inflation” notes Mr Marsh This time round it may take something similar from the other central bank in Frankfurt For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,How best to bring back manufacturing,Attitudes to manufacturing were a small but telling split in the cold war The Soviet Union had such a focus on industry that its statisticians kept services from the country measure of national income A year after the conflict ended Michael Boskin then the White House chief economist is said to have joked it did not matter whether the “chips” America produced were made from semiconductors or potatoes There are echoes in the present geopolitical face-off Xi Jinping China president is so focused on hard tech that he has cracked down on consumer-tech firmsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut Mr Boskin laissez-faire approach is no longer in vogue among Western policymakers They have introduced a sweep of policies intended to “onshore” manufacturing In July America Congress passed the Chips and Science Act which will dole out $52bn to the chip industry over five years mostly to subsidise domestic production Japan and Europe are also spending big on chips The majority of the eu €43bn $49bn package will subsidise “mega fabs” or cutting-edge chip-fabrication plants In August America also passed a climate-change package worth nearly $400bn stuffed with “made in the usa” subsidies to be spent over ten years West Virginia is getting wind farms; electric-vehicle battery factories are coming to Ohio Arguments for onshoring fit into two categories The first concern security More than 90% of advanced chips many needed for manufacturing weapons are made in Taiwanfar closer to China than is comfortable for the West The second concern economics Advocates claim that manufacturing can create mountains of well-paid jobs Economists are doubtful A paper published in 2018 by Teresa Fort of Dartmouth College Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and Peter Schott of the Yale School of Management finds that the number of jobs in American manufacturing has fallen considerably since 2000 but output has not That is in part because American industry has become more technologically intensive and therefore productive It is thus unlikely more high-tech factories will mean many more jobsBut there is another more subtle economic case for onshoring Gary Pisano and Willy Shih both of Harvard Business School argue that there can be broader “spillover” benefits to innovation from having a strong manufacturing base One way this happens is when research and development r&d on products is done next to the manufacturing of them This eases collaboration between the two stages which is especially important in the early days of new products A working paper by Ms Fort Wolfgang Keller of the University of Colorado and colleagues looks at innovation among American firms It finds that those that locate their manufacturing near their r&d produce more patents and citations Indeed the smaller the geographic distance between the manufacturing and innovation arms of a firm the more innovation ensuesWhat about when firms deem it better value-for-money to move production elsewhere? Another working paper by Lee Branstetter then of Carnegie Mellon University Britta Glennon of the University of Pennsylvania and colleagues examines just that In 2001 Taiwan lifted rules banning the offshoring of production to China but only for some products The study finds that offshoring did reduce the quantity of patents related to these products But it also freed up resources for r&d in adjacent types of products leading to more patents in these areas Mr Pisano and Mr Shih suggest that the benefits of locating r&d and manufacturing near one another depends on the type of work For instance when your columnist researched and wrote this article there was no reason for him to be located near the printer or distributor of The Economist because software neatly separates the two steps By contrast new biotech drugs often require r&d to be near production facilities because drug design is closely linked to the manufacturing process Semiconductors the subject of many of the recent round of industrial policies lie somewhere in between these two types of work A few firms like Nvidia in California only design chips and send the designs overseas to be made by other companies like tsmc a Taiwanese chip firm But Taiwan also has a burgeoning chip-design industry in part because of its advanced-manufacturing prowess which makes it easier for startups to prototype and test new ideasTo subsidise or not to subsidiseThat manufacturing sometimes boosts innovation does not justify the enormous price tag carried by subsidies Even many economists who sing industry praises concur Governments tend to be poor at picking industries and technologies to support And as Mr Pisano notes if there truly were big enough benefits to be found from moving r&d and manufacturing near one another firms would do it themselvesThe case of American competition with Japan in the 1980s and 1990s offers a useful parallel Just like now policymakers in Washington worried about losing market share in advanced-tech manufacturing But as Mr Branstetter and colleagues noted in a paper in 2013 a falling market share did not stop American firms from better capitalising on the software boom that followed One difference between the countries was openness to immigration American firms could simply draw on a bigger pool of programmers Mr Branstetter also notes that Japan government incentivised hardware manufacturing delaying a pivot to softwareIn a twist of fate such openness to foreign talent may support manufacturing at home Another working paper by Ms Glennon finds strong evidence that restrictions on h1b visas which are intended for employment of high-skilled foreigners lead to more offshoring as firms are forced to head abroad for talent That is an inconvenient finding for the many politicians who both support domestic manufacturing and are loth to increase immigration Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to escape scientific stagnation Oct 27thWhy inflation refuses to go away Oct 19thEnergy shocks can have perverse consequences Oct 13thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 2nd 2022,The Fed delivers another jumbo rate rise and it far from done,As recently as the start of June investors and analysts believed that a “jumbo” interest-rate rise for the Federal Reserve meant half a percentage point How quaint After four straight increases of three-quarters of a percentage pointthe latest on November 2ndperceptions have changed Indeed a stockmarket rally in the two weeks before the announcement was rooted in the belief that the Fed may scale down to a half-point rate increase at its next meeting in December What was once jumbo is now moderateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhether the Fed will in fact downshift to a half-point increase is a matter for debate Bond pricing assigns roughly even odds to the central bank opting for that smaller increment versus yet another three-quarter-point increase At a news conference following the Fed latest move Jerome Powell the central bank chairman resisted tipping his hand in either direction And for good reason: inflation figures for both October and November will be published before the Fed next meeting and go a long way to determining what it does There is little sense in guessing the outcome before seeing that dataBut the focus on the size of the rise is also too narrow As Mr Powell notes the Fed tightening of monetary policy can be looked at in three dimensions: how quickly it raises rates how high it raises them and how long it then keeps them there The first dimension is already clear Although the Fed was late in launching its rate-rise cycle it has moved with alacrity since starting raising short-term borrowing rates from 0% in March to 375% nowits most aggressive increase in four decadesThe second dimension is also becoming clearer In September the median expectation of Fed officials was that rates would peak at 46% next year Bond pricing now has the peak pegged at 5% reflecting the fact that a variety of inflation indicators have stayed stubbornly high Mr Powell suggested that the Fed thinking is in line with the bond market Even so there is a logic for slightly smaller increases from here on Just as an aeroplane slows before landing so ideally does a central bank before settling on its peak rateThe biggest uncertainty surrounds the final dimension How long will the Fed need to keep rates at a restrictive level? It estimates that the long-term neutral levelthat which is neither inflationary nor stimulativeis about 25% By this yardstick nominal rates are already in restrictive territory But in real terms with inflation still running at more than 8% annually policy remains loose So the question is when the economy will react to themSome developments have been predictable Mortgage rates have more than doubled over the past year exceeding 7% That has led to a sharp fall in house purchases But the resilience of the labour market has been harder to predict There are still nearly twice as many job openings as there are unemployed people placing upward pressure on wages and in turn inflationAt several points during the conference Mr Powell emphasised that the Fed would keep rates high for as long as is required Markets have priced in a pivot before the end of 2023 The view is the Fed will trim rates in the second half of the year But it has raised them faster and higher than investors had expected There is a good chance it will also keep them high for longer than investors currently expect For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

are not accounted for on lenders’ balance-sheets and include a dizzying array of financial products As a result the stock of these assets has fallen by 15% since 2017 but still amounts to an astonishing 56trn yuan $8trn or a seventh of all banking-system assets And now that China economy is slowing investors are discovering that many financial products marketed as low-risk are in fact quite high-risk Xi Jinping China leader who has just secured a third term lists financial stability as one of his main aims The problem is that finding safe investments in China is becoming harder and harder Strict capital controls prevent people from putting their money to use overseas Chinese stockmarkets are volatile and offer miserable returns According to East Money a financial-data firm just 1% of local funds have produced any returns this year with investors losing money on the rest The property market long the main destination for investments thanks to ever-increasing home prices has been thrown into turmoil by a government crackdown on leverage Prices have fallen in many cities This means that China trust industry a major part of the country shadow-banking system and another popular investment destination has also been thrown into turmoil Trust products have high investment thresholds usually above 1m yuan and attract wealthier investors They are often sold by banks promising returns higher than deposits and channelling funds to riskier borrowers who otherwise might not be able to take out loans Property developers have been big borrowers Defaults used to be rare But as developers go bust they often fail to pay back loans Between 40-60% of assets at three large trust firmsMinsheng Wanxiang and Huachenare non-performing this year Anxin another large company reports that almost all of its assets have gone south Out of the 57bn yuan in investments on which trust firms defaulted in the first seven months of this year some 80% were linked to property loans Wang Zhen of Hwabao Securities a broker recently labelled these investments a “disaster zone”Ms Fang invested almost 10m yuan in two products in 2020 and 2021 They were sold by a Chinese branch of the Bank of East Asia bea which is based in Hong Kong but were issued by Minsheng She was assured by a bea salesperson that she could cash out by mid-2021 when she expected to need the funds to build a polyethylene plant But when that time came the funds were frozen Bank employees told her to wait A year on she and more than 200 other investors with hundreds of millions of yuan on the line have seen neither the principal or interest on the productsProtests at the bea have caught the authorities off guard Hundreds of people have shown up at bank branches over the past month At one gathering in Shanghai protesters demanding their money back surrounded the building for several hours The incident in some respects resembled a mini bank run with many customers asking to cash out of financial products and deposits The bank released a statement saying customers could still withdraw from their accountsThese protests are part of a broader trend In May people from across the country gathered in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou to protest against the freezing of 40bn yuan in deposits at six village banks The banks all owned by one tycoon had attracted deposits through online platforms promising high interest rates But the funds were misused and the tycoon fled The local government is now attempting to repay at least some of the customersIn August angry homebuyers gathered at a branch of Bohai Bank in Shanghai to demand more information on their mortgages for homes at a development that has halted construction owing to a lack of money Online rumours of a freeze on withdrawals also led to a run on deposits in September at one of Jiangsu province largest banks The bank eventually was able to calm its customers but was also forced to increase its capital base A shuddering seismographThe situation seems likely to worsen China central bank has identified 122 “high-risk” outfits among the country 1651 village banks Trust in these smaller banks is depleting; many customers are attempting to move their deposits to larger more established institutions At banks with weak balance-sheets it does not take long for this dynamic to turn into a crisis As Zongyuan Zoe Liu of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank in New York notes some village banks have been forced to cap withdrawals shorten business hours or even freeze accounts to avoid runs on deposits Such measures are only a short-term solution as they tend to trigger new panics and additional runs on depositsAll of this is bad news for Mr Xi There is a reason he has made financial stability a central aim A wobbling banking industry undermines support for his government And to people like Ms Fang as well as those who notice her protests China financial system has rarely seemed shakier For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

China is not shy of doing so It tweaks foreign-reserve requirements on commercial banks to manage the yuan and majority state-owned lenders sometimes intervene on the central bank behalf Things are not so easy in countries with more open capital accounts and less high-handed governmentsIn the early 2000s the last time the dollar was as strong the question of intervention by financial institutions did not arise simply because the funds were much smaller As recently as 2010 South Korea pension fund was a third of its current size Since then populations have aged and sought higher returnsand portfolios have ballooned The firms’ sales of domestic currencies to buy foreign assets has kept the yen won and Taiwanese dollar weak which was welcome until recentlyThe level of influence that officials can exert over institutions varies The Bank of Korea and the country pension fund entered a $10bn currency-swap deal last month The fund agreed to borrow dollars from the central bank in exchange for won rather than selling the currency on the open market relieving a potential source of pressure on its market value Taiwanese life insurers unlike South Korea pension fund are private firms Even so they can be prodded in the right direction Taiwan central bank now allows life insurers to remit $100m-150m a day to the country according to Reuters a news agency When the local currency was stronger the central bank had been reluctant to allow such transfersJapan gpif has not been recruited to combat the weakening yen but that has not stopped speculation that it might be eventually The fund could hedge more of its assets in yen which could have the effect of strengthening the currency says Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank “On pure financial-management grounds there a question of whether the gpif should have such a large share of its foreign-currency holdings held on an unhedged basis” he adds Although the dollar has slipped a little in recent days that does not change the picture for Asian officials who are still dealing with far weaker currencies than they would like They will probably continue intervening And they may be tempted to bring outside assets into play For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

Perhaps an image of sweaty programmers swaying out of sync to thumping house music some boorishly shouting over it to discuss the latest crypto-token they are flogging their enthusiasm amplified by illicit substances Given the crypto community penchant for spectacular hacks rug-pulls and general calamity something somewhere is surely going dangerously awry However the reality as your columnist discovered on October 12th is a little different Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe raveor “raave” as it was marketed to partygoersshe attended was thrown by Stani Kulechov the founder of Aave an open-source protocol through which people are able to lend or borrow various cryptocurrencies The protocol is one of the more successful decentralised-finance DeFi applications Mr Kulechov hails from Finland and the word “aave” is Finnish for “ghost” which is the protocol logo He throws a chic party The raave was held on the sidelines of Devcon an annual conference hosted by the Ethereum Foundation a non-profit organisation that brings together developers working on Ethereum the second-most valuable blockchain This year the conference was in Bogotá the capital of Colombia The party took place in a converted warehouse filled with plants to evoke a jungle theme The bar served spicy mezcalitas Veronika Fleyta a British dj manned the decks The toilets worked There were even taxis waiting outside to take tired raavers to bedFar from being rammed with nerds the crowd was a mixed bunch Attendees included a Colombian girl who had participated in a hackathon before the conference kicked off a French programmer who was working on a method to distribute aid via Ethereum and a cheerful Mexican guy waiting in line for a raave t-shirt emblazoned with a “friendly ghost” logo in headphones None of them tried to shill tokens It was a grown-up eventone which reflects a newfound maturity among a community more commonly known as anything but Aave is a five-year-old company with a successful project it has spun off to be run by the community through what is known as a “decentralised autonomous organisation” or “dao” Its founder is working on his next venture a social-media protocol called “lens” which will allow users to “own” their followers taking them from one social-media application to the next and thus switch apps without losing clout The party is not the only evidence crypto is a more mature industry now Despite prices plunging into another so-called “crypto winter” the market capitalisation of all tokens is still around $1trn the same as in early 2020 Slumps no longer lead to questions about whether the end is nigh At Devcon several firms announced that despite the crash they had raised capital from venture firms UniSwap Labs founded by the creator of UniSwap another successful DeFi protocol raised $165m at a $17bn valuation Established venture-capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz which participated in the fundraising round are sticking with crypto Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the tech is getting better too Devcon came on the heels of “the merge” when Ethereum switched the mechanism by which it adds data to its blockchain The change essentially eliminated Ethereum carbon footprint overnight The next technological improvements are likely to increase the scale and reduce the cost of transactions which should make Ethereum useful for more than just financial applications Still it would be unwise to assume that a pocket of maturity reflects the entire crypto community A few days before Devcon during a visit to Miami your columnist considered attending another crypto partythis one favoured by bitcoin bros It would have been in a nightclub in Wynwood a neighbourhood filled with pastel-coloured buildings and crypto firms The area is home to the headquarters of Blockchaincom a crypto-trading platform and will soon host the American base of ftx an exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried a well-known crypto billionaire First though she checked it was a good idea with the crowd who had gathered for a weekly bitcoin brunch at a Haitian restaurant “Ermthat is actually a strip club” one of them sheepishly replieda step too far even for a journalist willing to brave a crypto raveRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Can Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Oct 26th 2022,Can Gary Gensler solve every problem in American finance?,Everyone in finance has an opinion of Gary Gensler To many the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission sec America main financial regulator is meddlesome and overreaching Mention him in crypto circles and you invite a convoluted description of a token or project followed by the speaker hissing: “How can that be a security?!” His plans have raised the eyebrows of other policymakers alarmed lobbyists in Washington and panicked much of Wall Street One bank boss sneers that his agenda is ridiculous So broad are his aims “he must think he is an Avenger” assuming he can “swoop in and fix every problem in finance”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is impressive to have made such an impression after 18 months at the helm In Mr Gensler brief time in office he has made filings to propose or finalise 40 sets of rules At this point Jay Clayton his Republican predecessor had made just a third as many and Mary Jo White the Democrat who preceded Mr Clayton around two-thirds see chart Mr Gensler is keeping his speechwriter busy too Since assuming office he has given 60 speeches twice as many as Mr Clayton in his whole tenure Mr Gensler has even found the time to charge Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting a crypto securityYet Mr Gensler does not seem the type to court controversy He speaks with the precision of a central banker and avoids talking about specific firms or rules his agency has not opined on When discussing thorny problems in an interview with The Economist he frequently appeals to first principlessuch as fairness for investors level playing fields between market institutions and safe investingwhich he wants to be the legacy of his time in office Perhaps Mr Gensler critics are driven to ad hominem attacks because it is hard otherwise to undermine his authority No one can accuse him of being underqualified in finance or regulation Mr Gensler cut his teeth on Wall Street joining Goldman Sachs at 22 By 30 he was one of the bank youngest-ever partners He then worked at the Treasury during Bill Clinton presidency and ran the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama “He wrote a lot of Dodd-Frank He is a very smart man” says the boss of a big firm referring to America post-financial-crisis legislation “He is not someone I would want to go up against” He even understands crypto much to the chagrin of those who wish to paint him as someone who does not “get it” In 2018 he taught a course on blockchains for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology business school which is available in its entirety on YouTube It reveals both a deep knowledge of the tech and the fact that years in regulation have not dulled Mr Gensler capitalist instincts In his first lecture he quizzed students on what they wanted from the class When reviewing the results the next week he revealed that five people had admitted their aim was to make money: “And I applaud those who said that because: Own it You’re in a business school Why not?” he grinnedMr Gensler frenetic activity partly reflects the chaotic time he started the job He was appointed in April 2021 a year after the Treasury marketthe world most important financial marketseized up during a pandemic-induced dash for cash A financial boom was roaring Beeple an artist had just sold a non-fungible token for $69m kicking off a frenzy for crypto assets Special-purpose acquisition vehicles spacs were raising billions of dollars a week And retail traders enabled by new apps were kicking off a 50-fold increase in shares of GameStop an electronics-retail firm pushing short-sellers brokers and the stock-settlement system to the brink Little surprise then that Mr Gensler has grand plans He wants to change the settlement system to reduce the risk facing retail brokers He also thinks the Treasury market should be centrally cleared so that a single institution stands between buyers and sellers taking counterparty risk This he explains is because central clearing promotes competition In doing so it also “enhances and expands access lowers counterparty risk helps broaden the marketand on the margin results in a bit more liquidity” His ideas do not stop there Mr Gensler has proposed rules to force spacs to match the disclosure requirements of initial public offerings the mere suggestion of which was enough to quell fundraising His suggestions for climate disclosure would force firms to measure and report on emissions in regulatory filings New rules are imminent on the structure of stockmarkets and the process by which retail brokers direct stock orders to intermediaries known as payment by order flow The sec seems fixated on levelling the playing field between the exchanges which are limited in how they make and quote prices and the wholesalers which are not “I can’t prejudge where we’ll come out” says Mr Gensler “But our goal is about enhancing the competition and lowering the costs”Many of these suggestions such as reducing settlement times or centrally clearing Treasuries are sensible and have support from market participants But Mr Gensler has not shied away from topics such as environmental rules or stockmarket structure that are controversial and surely will attract legal challenges Nor is he inclined to let accusations of overreach impede him Congress has proposed several bills to clarify the authority the sec has over the crypto industry Mr Gensler does not appear to believe they are necessary “I think it pretty clear I think that nearly 90 years ago Congress painted with a broad brush” when defining the powers of regulators he says “And I’m quoting Thurgood Marshall there the famous Supreme Court Justice who wrote that in the 1970s”Cynics think this sweeping agenda is a ploy to draw attention “Clearly he has got his eye on higher office” says one referring to gossip he wants a top government job But Mr Gensler more controversial plansin crypto say or the structure of stockmarketsdo hew to the principles by which he is most animated such as fairness and consumer protection Perhaps the idea that Mr Gensler will soon move on is nothing more than wishful thinking He has plenty of power where he is For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only

 Oct 26th 2022,How to escape scientific stagnation,In 2008 ben jones of Northwestern University formalised a simple yet powerful observation The more knowledge humans have the longer it takes a budding researcher to get to the frontier and thus to push things forward In a paper provocatively titled “The burden of knowledge and the death of the Renaissance man” Mr Jones argued humanity growing knowledge would slow scientific progress and thus economic growth More recent research has solidified this view In 2020 economists at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology mit published another provocatively titled paper “Are ideas getting harder to find?” which concluded that in areas from crop yields to microchip density new ideas were indeed getting harder to findListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe slowdown has spurred academics and policymakers looking to bolster scientific enterprise Many are turning to darpa a cold war outfit which funds high-risk “moonshot” research for inspiration Last year the National Institutes of Health nih America largest science funder launched a new arm with an annual budget of $1bn called arpa-h Other countries including Britain and Germany have set up their own versions In July America Congress authorised nearly $200bn in new scientific funding over the next decade although it is yet to stump up the cash in the process creating a branch of the National Science Foundation nsf for applied science and tech Philanthropists are joining the action too: their funding of basic research has nearly doubled in the past decade All these efforts aim to help science get back its risk-loving mojo In a working paper published last year Chiara Franzoni of the polimi Graduate School of Management and Paula Stephan of Georgia State University look at a number of measures of risk based on analyses of text and the variability of citations These suggest science reward structure discourages academics from taking chances The most common way research is funded through peer reviewin which academics in similar fields score proposalsdeserves some blame In 2017 using a data set of almost 100000 nih grant applications Danielle Li then of Harvard University found that reviewers seem to favour ideas similar to their own expertise If a project must satisfy a committee it is not surprising that unorthodox ideas struggle to make it throughThis suggests that breaking bad funding habits should make a difference The dARPA model which has more in common with venture capital than traditional funding structures is an attempt to do just that It empowers programme directors to finance high-risk high-reward projects with a bent towards real-world use But though it has proved successful in the defence industryfunding groundbreaking technologies from the early internet to gpsit may not be quite as successful elsewhere A book chapter published in February by Ms Li and Pierre Azoulay at mit notes that the darpa model does best when its programme directors have a clear understanding of the sort of breakthroughs that are needed This is often the case at darpa itself where both the funder and user of new tech is the defence department In areas like energy or health care things are rather less straightforward The end users are many and dispersed rather than a single government department Indeed other work by Mr Azoulay and colleagues notes that although arpa-e an energy-focused outfit launched in 2009 is still in its relatively early days it is yet to produce advances on a par with its defence-orientated predecessorAnother approach in vogue is to fund “people not projects” Most conventional grants fund specific projects for a specific amount of time usually a few years which researchers worry prevents them from pivoting to new ideas when old ones do not work out and fails to allot enough time for risky ones to come to fruition A study in 2011 compared researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute where they are granted considerable flexibility over their research agendas and lots of time to carry out investigations with similarly accomplished ones funded by a standard nih programme The study found that researchers at the institute took more risks As a result they produced nearly twice as much highly cited work as well as a third more “flops” articles with fewer citations than their previously least-cited work These results may be hard to replicate elsewhere Researchers at the Howard Hughes institute are selected for attributes that suggest they will thrive in such a flexible environment But the gap is big enough to indicate that others may also benefit from more freedomThe science of scienceDespite the uncertainty about exactly how best to fund scientific research economists are confident of two things The first is that a one-size-fits-all approach is not the right answer says Heidi Williams of Stanford University darpa models the Howard Hughes Medical Institute curiosity-driven method and even handing out grants by lottery as the New Zealand Health Research Council has tried all have their uses Evaluation of them can then build knowledge of what works says Matt Clancy an economist who curates a continuously updated online literature survey on innovation itself an experiment in how to improve science The second is that this burst of experimentation must continue The boss of the nsf Sethuraman Panchanathan agrees He is looking to reassess projects whose reviews are highly variablea possible indication of unorthodoxy He is also interested in a Willy Wonka-style funding mechanism called the “Golden Ticket” which would allow a single reviewer to champion a project even if his or her peers do not agree Mr Clancy notes that many venture-capital partnerships employ similar policies because they prioritise the upside of long-shot projects rather than seeking to minimise failure Thus far there is little quantitative evidence on whether Golden Tickets produce Golden Outcomes All the more reason to try them Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why inflation refuses to go away Oct 19thEnergy shocks can have

 Oct 23rd 2022,Even super-tight policy is not bringing down inflation,It feels a little unfair In July 2021 as rate-setters in America and Europe dismissed the risk of entrenched inflation the Central Bank of Chile got its act together Worried that inflation would rise and stay high its policymakers voted to lift rates from 05% to 075% The bank has since raised rates again and again outpacing investors’ expectations and taking the policy rate all the way up to 1125% Perhaps no other central bank has pursued price stability with such dedication Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHas the star pupil been rewarded? Hardly In September Chile prices rose by 14% year on year The central bank preferred measure of “core” inflation which excludes volatile components like energy and food jumped to 11% Chile example speaks to a wider problem Many pundits say that if only the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and others had “got ahead of the curve” by quickly raising rates last year the world would not be struggling with high inflation today The experience of Chile and other places that tightened early and aggressively casts doubt on that argument All over the world it is proving extraordinarily difficult to crush price rises The Economist has gathered data on Chile and seven other countries in which the central bank started a tightening cycle at least a year ago and did so after having slashed interest rates to an all-time low early in the covid-19 pandemic see chart  The group includes Brazil Hungary New Zealand Norway South Korea Peru and Poland Although Russia would have qualified we have excluded it because its circumstances are unique Call the unlikely gang “Hikelandia” In the year to October the median economy in Hikelandia raised rates by six percentage points If as expected the Fed raises rates by 075 percentage points on November 2nd America cumulative increase over the past year will still be nowhere near as big Unsurprisingly turning the monetary screws has slowed Hikelandia economy The property market has come off the boil as mortgage rates have risen House prices are drifting down in New Zealand South Korea pandemic housing boom has ended Goldman Sachs a bank produces a “current-activity indicator” a real-time measure of economic strength Using its data we find that Hikelandia economy is weakening relative to the global average And there is worse to come Chile central bank expects gdp to shrink next year Inflation however remains stubborn see chart 2 Central banks often focus on the rate of core inflation which better reflects domestic inflationary pressures In September core inflation in Hikelandia hit 95% year on year up 35 percentage points from March Worse still the gap between global core inflation and Hikelandia reading seems to be widening not shrinkingDig into the national statistics of Hikelandia and the trends become even more concerning Chile wage growth continues to accelerate In September South Korea inflation rate in the labour-intensive service sector was 42% year on year its highest since the early 2000s In the past six months Hungary service-sector inflation has climbed from 72% to 115% Across the club inflation is becoming more dispersed affecting a wider range of goods and services In September the price of 89% of the components in Norway inflation basket rose by more than 2% year on year up from 53% six months before In research on Poland published in late September economists at Goldman Sachs found evidence that “underlying inflation momentum has picked up again” Hikelandia struggles raise three possibilities The first is that it is currently unrealistic to expect inflation to fall Research suggests that there are lags sometimes long ones between tighter monetary policy and lower inflation It is also tricky to control inflation when almost every currency is depreciating against the dollar making imports more expensive All this may be true But after being surprised again and again by inflation you would be brave to bet that Hikelandia inflation will soon be anywhere near central banks’ targets even if conditions begin to improveThe second possibility is that policymakers including those in Hikelandia have not been sufficiently courageous Perhaps central banks should have raised interest rates more aggressively This is an argument stridently made by Chile remaining “Chicago Boys” libertarian economists who spearheaded the country free-market reforms in the 1970s Governments might also do more to help out After ramping up spending when the pandemic struck the median budget deficit in Hikelandia has fallen but is still wide at 3% of gdp Further increases to taxes or cuts to public spending would help reduce demand Yet this strategy carries risks too Implementing austerity during a cost-of-living crisis would be deeply unpopular And Chile which has nonetheless taken the plunge and is forecast to run a budget surplus this year is still seeing little payoff in terms of lower inflationThat leads to a third possibilityand the most worrying one Perhaps inflation is simply harder to stop than anyone could have predicted a year ago A report published in the summer by the Bank for International Settlements a club for central banks hinted at this possibility In a “low-inflation regime” the norm before the pandemic no one paid much attention to prices ensuring they did not rise quickly But in a “high-inflation regime” such as in the 1970s households and firms start to track inflation closely leading in time to “behavioural changes that could entrench it” If the world has shifted from one norm to another then different tools may be needed to cool prices For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance

 Oct 20th 2022,Can Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?,After a month of being exciting for all the wrong reasons Britain bond market is at last settling down All it took was an emergency bond-buying programme from the central bank the defenestration of a chancellor the installation of a sensible successor the humiliation of a prime minister and the shredding of a vast unfunded tax-cutting package that set the fiasco in motion Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt the height of the chaos Britain five-year borrowing costs were higher than those of Italy and Greece two countries that have difficult relationships with their lenders Although the markets are now calmer the country sovereign bonds or “gilts” still trade at much higher yields than they did before the self-inflicted blow Dario Perkins of ts Lombard an investment-research firm has dubbed this a “moron risk premium” What does the premium mean for Jeremy Hunt the new chancellor as he seeks to restore order to the country finances?It is important to remember that countries are not companies Familiar measures from the corporate-bond market do not mean the same thing when applied to sovereign debt If two American firms borrow in dollars at different rates the implication is that the one with the lower rate is the more creditworthy In some cases this works for government debt too such as for countries like Argentina and Colombia that borrow a lot in another country currency the American dollar or for those like Germany and Italy that share a currency and a central bank But for the most part it does not America ten-year yield is higher than Slovakia That does not mean America government is the riskier prospect Similarly Britain has not suddenly morphed into one of the euro zone more troubled membersInstead government-bond yields reflect a wealth of interlinked factors Chief among these is the expected future path for the interest rate set by the central bank whose currency is being borrowed There is information about inflation which may force the bank to raise rates gdp growth which may make it more sanguine about doing so and unemployment which may make it more reluctant There is a judgment about the central bank own hawkishness or dovishness Then there are the other risks If the currency is likely to weaken foreign investors should demand a higher yield to compensate If inflation remains untamed the value of both interest payments and principal will be eroded also requiring a higher yield There is little doubt the actions of Britain government have pumped up gilt yields But these yields say as much about the country economic trajectory as they do about its government credibility with investorsOne way to sharpen the picture is to take the government-bond yield for a given maturity and subtract the average interest rate the market expects from the central bank over that period Known as the “asset-swap spread” this is analogous to the credit spread for a corporate borrower For the long-dated gilts that sparked Britain near-meltdown the measure did indeed balloon in the last week of September before falling back to lesser levels once the Bank of England intervened Yet asset-swap spreads are also contaminated by other factors like demand for government debt for use as collateral or liability matching A better option is to look at the cost to insure a government debt Credit-default swaps are bilateral contracts where one counterparty agrees to insure the other against the loss due to default on a specified bond in exchange for a fixed stream of payments The fixed stream is quoted as a percentage of the amount insured or “spread” and implies a probability of default for the issuer of the underlying bond Britain credit-default swaps trade at far lower spreads than those of Italy which means the market perceives Britain risk of default to be much lowerIf yields are a bad guide to risk their volatility is a better one Daily movements are measured in “basis points” or hundredths of a percentage point It tells you something that the intraday range for British 30-year gilts on September 28th spanned 127 of them more than the annual range in all but four of the last 27 years Before the blow-up the largest daily increase had been a mere 29 basis points Since then similar-sized moves have become routine Britain sovereign debt is not flashing red with bankruptcy risk But its chancellor and his successors face a long and grinding slog to convince investors that gilts are once again a safe betRead more from Buttonwood our columnist

elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAustralian house prices have dropped for five straight months placing Quakers Hill at the forefront of a global trend As central banks race to tame inflation they are raising interest rates at the fastest pace in at least four decadeswhich is now translating into housing-market carnage Prices are falling in nine of the 18 countries monitored by Oxford Economics a consultancy and are dropping fastest in the most overheated markets In Canada and Sweden they have fallen by more than 8% since February; in New Zealand they have fallen by more than 12% since their peak last year Prices have begun sliding in America and Britain too Many other countries are heading in the same direction Transactions are also down Home sales in America fell by a fifth in August compared with the previous year according to the National Association of Realtors a lobby group In New Zealand quarterly sales were at their weakest since 2010 in the three months to June The share prices of large British builders such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey have halved this year Those of dr Horton and Lennar America biggest are down by more than 30% This represents the end of a long boomone which many homeowners have come to take for granted Rock-bottom mortgage rates and constrained supply fuelled a steady rise in rich-world house prices in the decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 Prices in America for instance rose by nearly 60% from their trough in 2012 to the end of 2019 Then came the pandemic during which prices truly rocketed In America Canada and the Netherlands they are up by more than 30% since 2020 Lockdowns and the shift to remote work increased demand for suburban properties with gardens or offices Governments worried about a housing crunch as covid spread temporarily eased or removed mortgage regulations making it easier to buy Pandemic savings helped first-time buyers stump up hefty deposits But interest-rate rises have now returned mortgage rates to levels not seen for decades A year ago the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in America was below 3% Today it is only a little shy of 7% In New Zealand mortgage rates have passed 7% for the first time in eight years; in Britain the average five-year fixed-rate loan now exceeds 6% for the first time in a dozen This will make life more difficult for prospective buyers and will increase the chance of distress among existing homeowners It is a change that is likely to carry uncomfortable political and social consequences for many years to comeThree factors will determine where the pain is most acute and thus where these consequences are most likely The first is recent price growth Housing markets where prices have surged since the pandemic are especially vulnerable to cooling demand While many rich countries slowed to annual growth rates in the single digits at the start of this year America and Canada maintained double-digit rises fuelled by huge demand for housing in the mountain towns and sunbelt states that attract well-heeled Californians and New Yorkers along with cities like Toronto Borrowing levels are the second factor The higher household debt is as a share of income the more vulnerable owners are to higher mortgage payments and defaults Central bankers will find solace in the fact that household debt relative to income is lower than it was on the eve of the global financial crisis in countries including America Britain and Spain Yet some countries face a mountain of debt This makes them sensitive to even small rises in mortgage rates Households in Australia Canada and Sweden which managed to escape the full brunt of the financial crisis have run up staggering borrowings in the years since prompting warnings from financial watchdogs As Stefan Ingves governor of Sweden central bank has put it: “It like sitting on top of a volcano”The third factor is the speed with which higher interest rates pass through to homeowners The biggest risk is to borrowers on floating-rate mortgages which fluctuate with changes in policy rates They face an immediate reduction in their disposable income In Canada variable-rate mortgages account for more than half of all loans In Australia and Sweden they account for nearly two-thirds In other countries fixed-term borrowing is much more common which means that rate rises pass through with a considerable lag The vast majority of mortgages in America are on such terms These mortgages are also more popular than before across Europe But not all fixed-term loans are alike In America the bulk of them are fixed for two or three decades In other countries even fixed-rate borrowers will face soaring mortgage costs soon enough In New Zealand fixed-rate mortgages make up the bulk of existing loans but more than 70% have a maturity of less than two years So do nearly half of those that were taken out in Britain last year Bring this together and all the ingredients for a deep housing slump are in place This time though it is likely to be led not by America but by Canada the Netherlands Australia New Zealand and Norway see table In Australia and Canada prices could plunge by as much as 14% from their peak a little more than is expected in America or Britain according to forecasts from a number of property firms Economists at the Royal Bank of Canada expect the country volume of sales to plummet by more than 40% in 2022-23exceeding the 38% drop in 2008-09Pain thresholdsWithin each country some people will suffer more than others The credit quality of the average borrower has improved in recent years as tighter regulations introduced following the global financial crisis have made it more difficult for riskier borrowers to take out mortgages But the toxic combination of a rate shock and a surge in living costs will put homeowners under severe strain In Australia for instance three-fifths of housing credit is on variable terms According to the central bank latest financial-stability report published on October 7th half of these borrowers would see their spare cash or that left after mortgage and essential living expenses fall by at least a fifth if interest rates rise in line with market expectationsand 15% would see this measure turn negative In Britain nearly 2m households or a quarter of those with mortgages could see higher payments absorb an additional 10% of their household income by early 2025 In the Netherlands the share of homeowners paying more than a quarter of their income towards their mortgage would rise from 12% to 26% if interest rates were to rise by three percentage points First-time buyers and recent borrowers are especially vulnerable Many stretched their finances to buy a home leaving less spare cash to cover a jump in mortgage costs In America first-time buyers counted for one in three sales last year Many have meagre savings Around half of Australian buyers who took out loans between the start of 2021 and August 2022 had less than three months’ worth of mortgage payments set aside for a rainy day Millennials who have at last managed to buy a property are in for a nasty surpriseFirst-time buyers have also had less time to accumulate equity Oxford Economics estimates that a 15% drop in house prices in America over a year would cancel out two-thirds of the housing equity they have accumulated since the start of the pandemic By contrast older owners are more secure More than half of American homeowners aged 65 or over moved in before the turn of the millennium This leaves new owners at greater risk of being pushed into negative equity which makes it hard to move house or remortgage In Britain a 20% fall in house prices would leave as many as 5% of mortgages in negative equity according to Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts a consultancy Around one in ten mortgage-holders in London would be affectedThe good news is that banks should be able to weather the slump In 2007-09 a rise in unpaid debt pushed some American ones to the brink Banks in Britain now hold nearly four times as much capital to cover losses according to Capital Economics another consultancy The Bank of England latest stress test suggests the country lenders would be able to absorb a 33% fall in house prices and a rise in the unemployment rate from 35% to 12% In America banks have stepped back from the mortgage market with non-banks now providing more than half of new mortgage lending Thus risks are no longer concentrated in systemically important lenders Still the housing squeeze will have profound consequences “The housing cycle IS the business cycle” wrote Edward Leamer of the University of California Los Angeles in a paper published in 2007 It noted that housing slowdowns had preceded eight of the past ten recessions in America After the financial crisis Mr Leamer followed up with a paper entitled “Housing really is the business cycle” in case readers had failed to get the message The link between the two cycles arises because housing confers “wealth effects” on owner occupiers When house prices rise people feel good about their financial situation so borrow and spend more When they fall people tighten their belts In 2019 research by the Bank of England found that a 10% increase in house prices raises consumption by 035–05% Another important channel between the housing market and the rest of the economy is investment Capital spending associated with housing especially house building can be extremely volatileand is often the difference between a growing or shrinking economy Indeed falling residential investment accounted for a third of the fall in America gdp in 2007-09 Research on Britain has found similar results House builders chase booms and scarper at bad economic news As worries have mounted this time round American private housing starts have fallen by 20% since April This time strained borrowers already cash-strapped because of inflation and hefty energy bills will also spend less on other goods and services as they try to meet their higher mortgage payments Some people see an upside to a housing crash They hope lower prices will allow young folk to buy their first houses These hopes are almost certain to be dashed In housing corrections and sometimes for years after home ownership rates tend to fall rather than rise In Britain for instance about 65% of people own their own home down from 70% at the start of the global financial crisis In Ireland which experienced an almighty crash in the late 2000s the home ownership rate is still more than ten percentage points below its peak Economic conditions that cause house prices to fall simultaneously imperil the chances of would-be homeowners Unemployment rises and wages decline If interest rates jump people are able to borrow less and mortgage lenders tend to become more skittish about lending In Canada increased borrowing costs will “swamp” any savings from a lower purchase price predicts Tsur Somerville of the University of British Columbia The residential is politicalThe biggest effect of a housing downturn may be in politics In countries where home ownership is seen as a rite of passage lower prices without any increase in affordability will rub salt in already sore wounds “Falling to what? Falling to absurdly grotesque prices instead of just unthinkable?” asks Robin Black a community worker and bike mechanic in Montreal “Basically I’ve accepted that dream is over I missed the window” A few millennials have scrimped to afford a deposit; now they will have to struggle to make much higher mortgage payments The threat of repossession lurks Losing your house is a possibility in a way it was not beforeFor years more established homeowners took comfort in the thought that even if real-wage growth was terrible at least the price of their house was rising Those days are over Even baby-boomers the great winners from a decade of price growth now face the prospect of living off a smaller nest-egg in retirement as downsizing becomes less lucrative All this means rising interest rates will have unpredictable political repurcussions as people who once benefited from the status quo discover what it feels like to lose outDo not be surprised then if policymakers launch enormous rescue operations Already Hungary government has offered its citizens protection from rising mortgage interest rates In its analysis of New Zealand housing the imf worries that “policy support may be needed to avoid second-round effects and a pronounced downturn” In Spain banks are reportedly considering limiting payment increases on variable-rate mortgages Martin Lewis a British financial pundit who has more influence than all the country newspapers combined has started to campaign for state support for mortgage-holders As house prices fall to earth such demands will only grow For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 19th 2022,Why inflation refuses to go away,If the return of high inflation caught many off guard its refusal to leave has been more shocking stillin the past week countries including America and Britain have been surprised yet again by high prices The Federal Reserve goofed when it forecast in December 2020 that prices would rise by less than 2% in each of the following two years It goofed on a grander scale in December 2021 when it reckoned that inflation in 2022 would be just 26% even though prices were already rising by more than 5% a year But the Fed was hardly alone in its misjudgments imf forecasts have badly and repeatedly undershot inflation And in late 2020 this newspaper correctly judged that prices would jump in the months ahead but concluded that the odds of a more sustained period of inflation were low Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhy then has inflation been so damnably persistent? In one sense the answer is trivial: it has remained high because spending has remained high and because monetary policy has been too loose But this is an unsatisfying answer Policy has not been tighter because central banks did not think it needed to be see the errant forecasts And as inflation has persisted policy has adjusted Back in December 2020 the Fed thought its interest rate would remain near zero in 2023; now it expects it to rise to at least 46% What is trickier to work out is why inflation has repeatedly defied forecasts New work produced by a penitent imf takes a stab at the question Its analysis points to three potential culprits: shocks wages and expectations In 2020 and 2021 as the covid-19 pandemic interfered with the production of goods and services governments unleashed a torrent of fiscal aid Meanwhile the peculiar conditions faced by households led to dramatic shifts in consumption which swung sharply towards goods and then back towards services After an initial deflationary pulse the net effect of this turmoil was to push up prices Last year about 40% of the rise in American prices relative to the pre-pandemic trend and 66% of the rise in euro-area prices was attributable to disruptions to production and higher commodity prices the imf calculates Generous stimulus and shifts in household spending accounted for another 30% in both America and EuropeThe barrage of shocks continued with Russia invasion of Ukraine in February With the exception of those for America and China errors in the imf inflation forecasts for big economies have in fact been larger this year than last And although problems projecting core inflation were chiefly responsible for bad forecasts last year underestimates of contributions from food and energy have been the bigger problems this oneThe effect of Vladimir Putin war has been compounded by a shock rise in the value of the dollar which is largely a product of the Fed aggressive campaign against domestic inflation As other currencies weaken their economies’ import costs rise exacerbating inflation troubles In a note published on October 14th Gita Gopinath the imf deputy managing director and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas the fund chief economist calculate that a 10% appreciation in the value of the dollar raises consumer-price inflation in foreign economies by about 1% on average with larger effects in places more dependent on importsStrong wage growth is the second suspect In normal times wage growth is mostly determined by labour productivity inflation expectations and the presence or absence of labour-market slack Faster productivity growth and higher expected inflation translate into more wage growth; higher unemployment translates into less In the early stages of the pandemic these relationships broke down According to the imf analysis fundamentals mattered less than the intense constraints on labour supply associated with lockdowns and social distancing As the recovery kicked in normal patterns began to assert themselves Yet this has not helped much with wages The supply of labour has become less of a problem but pay packets have kept growing thanks to robust hiring and low unemployment Rising wages power consumer spending and contribute directly to higher prices for labour-intensive services Indeed some hawks worry about a wage-price spiral in which workers demand higher pay to cover rising prices as firms raise prices to cover rising wage bills Yet the imf work suggests some caution is in order Although wage growth has been strong in many countries it has not been strong enough to keep up with inflation Sinking real wages can act as a drag on spending and inflation A study of 22 historical episodes comparable to this oneduring which nominal pay rose and both unemployment and real wages fellfinds that wage-price spirals rarely emerge In the median episode inflation began to fall even as unemployment remained low which is a near-ideal scenario for policymakersNevertheless it persistedThere are caveats Tighter monetary policy was required to slow inflation in most cases The unusual nature of present circumstances may mean that past experience is of dubious relevance And crucially much depends on what happens to inflation expectationsa third and unpredictable inflationary force People beliefs about the future affect their consumption and wage bargaining If recent experience looms large in the formation of these beliefs that would help to explain persistent inflation and would complicate central bankers’ jobsBeliefs are tricky to measure but there is nevertheless some cause for concern Although measures of expectations in America have been relatively well-behaved those in Britain and the eu are less encouraging That as much as anything is why interest rates will keep climbing Having been fooled and fooled again central banks will not relent until the only inflation surprises are those on the downside Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Energy shocks can have perverse consequences Oct 13thWhy China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan Oct 6thEconomists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep 29thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

And as the world faces another energy shock what lessons can be learnt from its failure?Economists believe that technological progress is the ultimate driving force of growth The key question is what determines this progress direction In 1932 John Hicks an economist started the debate about “directed technical change” when he theorised in his book “The Theory of Wages” that raising the price of a certain factor of productionlabour in his examplewould spur innovation to bring down its cost In the century prior to his book publication wages had risen steadily which meant there was an incentive for employers to invest in labour-saving technologies rather than capital-saving ones Following this logic a spike in fossil-fuel prices should help to accelerate decarbonisation Such green growth is not inevitable however Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has pointed out that research spending can be directed either to clean substitutes such as solar power or complements to dirty tech such as more efficient engines For a firm the choice of where to direct money depends on the sometimes competing forces of price and market size An oil shock which raises the price of the fuel makes green technologies such as solar power more attractive But the extremely widespread use of hydrocarbons may make investments in fossil-fuel efficiency known as grey technologies more profitableThat was pretty much what happened in the 1970s Although some money was spent on projects like the Danish zero-energy house and in the embryonic renewables market much more went on grey technologies Research by Valerie Ramey of the University of California San Diego and Daniel Vine of the Federal Reserve finds that the main way historical oil shocks have affected the American economy is by encouraging consumers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles The economy of a typical American car improved from 13 miles a gallon in 1975 to 20 miles a gallon in 1980 Rather than pocketing the savings offered by more fuel-efficient cars Americans instead bought even bigger ones and in greater numbers Thus the long-term impact of the oil shock was not to kill the country car cultureit was to wedge the combustion engine even deeper into American life By the mid-1980s oil consumption was higher than a decade before even though many of the country power plants had switched to natural gas Environmental economists call this phenomenonwhere fuel-saving measures perversely raise demandthe “rebound effect” Something similar happened in Danish housing Better insulation improved its energy efficiency; as a result houses grew larger and their owners more used to higher temperatures It became common for example to wear t-shirts indoors during winter According to official statistics total housing energy consumption has been unchanged for the past three decades Mr Acemoglu argues there is “path dependency” in technological progress Energy efficiency can make it harder for other technologies to compete A well-insulated house with a state-of-the-art gas boiler uses less fuel But that makes the upfront investment of an electric heat pump less appealing If Europe industry successfully maintains output this winter while using less gas it may in the future have less incentive to switch to green methods Differences from previous energy shocks offer some room for optimism Economic modellers point to the “elasticity of substitution” as the critical measure for whether expensive fossil fuels accelerate the adoption of green or grey technologies Encouragingly this elasticity has increased since the 1970s Today a rise in price should encourage more switching away from fossil fuels than in the past thanks to the wider availability and lower cost of green alternatives Green thumbsMoreover carbon prices place government thumbs on the scale The cost of a permit in the eu cap-and-trade scheme is only expected to rise in the future as the cap on the quantity of emissions falls meaning firms have an incentive to get ahead of the curve With luck this will limit the rebound effect in the years ahead But America is going down a different road Subsidising clean technologies rather than taxing dirty onesthe strategy adopted by President Joe Biden recent Inflation Reduction Actdoes not do nearly as much to displace fossil fuels A family may buy a subsidised battery-powered vehicle for instance but only to complement a fossil-fuel one which they can continue to drive without penalty Policy design matters if a zero-carbon world is to become more than just another future that never happened For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan Oct 6thEconomists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep 29thChina rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy Sep 22nd

rising interest rates investors have tightened their purse strings As a result fintech funding has collapsed see chart The average deal has fallen from $32m in 2021 to $20m in 2022 Between July and September a mere six firms graduated to unicorn status achieving a valuation of $1bn or more compared with 48 in the same period last year Exits have also stalled There were 27 public listings in the last quarter of 2021 compared with two in the one just passedThe speed of the slump has caught many in the industry by surprise A year ago fintech founders were like “kids in a candy store” says Jeff Tijssen of Bain a consultancy Plentiful venture-capital funding allowed them to launch into foreign markets make bold acquisitions and hire the best staff Future revenue was richly valued and startups chased growth at all costs Now “a dollar of revenue” is worth considerably less says Michael Treskow of Eight Roads a venture-capital firm and not all revenue is “equal” As investors demand a path to profitability founders’ wings are being clipped Employees meanwhile are heading elsewhere Whizz kids previously up for a gamble are slinking off to consultancies and banks Many need a new job anyway: fintechs have sacked 7300 staff since AprilThe shift started in the public markets where the ten largest fintechs have lost $850bn in value in the past year As the route to initial-public offerings became more difficult the biggest private firms began to be affected Some cash-strapped giants including Klarna a buy-now-pay-later lender have seen their valuations slashed by more than 80% in “down” funding rounds Those still closing “up rounds” including Acorns an investing app are often doing so on tough terms guaranteeing that new backers will double their money even in the “worst-case” forecasts All of this is common to other tech sectors But fintechs look especially vulnerable because many are directly exposed to the risk of recession Lenders that used cheap funding to provide online mortgages and buy-now-pay-later loans face soaring costs and rising defaults Neobanks that rely on transaction fees are being starved of revenues Businesses that banked on the boom in retail investing from crypto exchanges to online brokers are suffering as trading volumes collapse Those catering to small firms may well go under with their wobbly clients Thus many startups will struggle to make it through winter But those that provide essential services to digitising firms should keep attracting venture-capital funds many of which have money lying unspent In America alone their collective “dry powder” hit $290bn in the last quarter twice the average from 2016 to 2020 With consumer spending set to crash in Europe American startups are valued at a premium says Lily Shaw of Omers Ventures the venture-capital arm of a Canadian pension fund Beyond this geographic trend three types of fintech firms look best equipped to attract venture-capital doshFirst are companies that reduce inefficiencies from the management of company expenses to the reconciliation of business payments and thus ought to help companies cut back in more difficult times Next are firms that create new revenue lines for their clients such as enabling a travel agent to sell their customers insurance The final group includes financial plumbers from firms providing data or ones dabbling in crypto to those that help banks comply with sanctions Only a few fortunate upstartssuch as GoCardless which facilitates recurring bank-to-bank payments and Clearbank which provides cloud-based payments softwaretick all three boxes They run the infrastructure that moves money around at a time when the dominant “rails” remain costly think of those 3% credit-card fees and old-fashioned firms want to

 Oct 13th 2022,Rates are rising at unprecedented speed When will they bite?,If you want to impress central bankers inject “long and variable lags” into a conversation and heave a heavy sigh The phrase coined by Milton Friedman a Nobel-prizewinning economist is sophisticated shorthand for the delayed and uncertain effects of monetary policy Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRaising rates as most central banks are now doing should lead to slower growth and lower inflation But it can take time for the full impact to be felt Hence Friedman idea of a long lag The variability meanwhile refers to the lack of a predictable interval between raise and result Lags present an acute challenge at the moment Tightening in the past few decades has been gradual helping to mitigate uncertainty This time central banks are furiously ratcheting up rates The Federal Reserve is on course to raise them from a floor of 0% to 4% by the end of this year its steepest tightening in four decades Economists including Ben Bernanke a former chairman of the Fed and a new Nobel laureate estimate lags between monetary policy and inflation can last as long as two years The result is that America may be digesting the jumbo rate rises of the past few months well into 2024 by which time the economic picture will look different This is one reason why some economists are calling for central banks to switch to smaller rate rises if any They want policymakers to survey the impact thus far in order to avoid needlessly adding to future pain Yet the mere existence of lags cannot be an argument for inaction They are a known unknown Their precise duration may be uncertain but the fact that there will be a delay is well understood Any decent model contains assumptions about this Fed officials expect to shift from raising to cutting rates in 2024 and 2025 But they also expect inflation to continue to recede in both those yearsan indication of how lags are baked into their forecastsMoreover an increase in central-bank transparency may be compressing lags In America mortgage rates had increased by a full percentage point even before the Fed had raised short-term rates This has not happened in previous cycles and represents the fastest pricing-in of expectations in at least four decades see chart As a result the housing market has had at least half a year to respond to higher mortgage rates Sure enough home sales prices and new construction have all started to fall In a way the Fed is lagging the market: its rate increases are in part ratifying expectations that are already influencing activityNone of this is to minimise the risk from lags Friedman believed they all but doomed counter-cyclical interventions He viewed such attempts as “disturbances with a peculiarly high potential for mischief” Central bankers are more confident But persistent inflation does underscore Friedman point about the challenges of getting policy right whether tightening or easing Today woes stem in part from aggressive stimulus in 2020 and 2021The mischief in other words can cut both ways Doves worry that excessive tightening will lead to a bad recession Hawks fear that a premature halt will lead to continued bad inflation Both worry the Fed will get its timing wrong again just in diametrically opposite directions For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 13th 2022,Credit-default swaps are an unfairly maligned derivative,Vultures rats and maggots are often the focus of disgust less because of anything for which they can be blamed and more because of the conditions with which they are associated Death disease and squalor carry a stigma that is hard to shake Something similar is true of credit-default swaps financial instruments that make headlines during market turmoil and economic miseryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen charts of credit-default swap prices begin to crop up in financial research it is invariably a bad sign Russia invasion of Ukraine prompted a burst of activity with conditions in both Kyiv and Moscow triggering swaps and thus interest in the instruments More recently prices for European banks have jumped The cost of a five-year credit-default swap for Credit Suisse bonds has surged to twice the level reached in the market mayhem at the start of covid-19But like the scavenging bird hovering above a weary desert beast the swaps have an important role to play They insure the buyer against the default of a bond or an index of bonds As with other index products the inclusion of a range of swaps creates more liquidity The instruments can protect portfolios and counterparties from volatility and be used to speculate on individual firms’ health and broader market conditionsThe role swaps played in the financial crisis did not help their reputation Their market more than quadrupled in size from 2005 to 2007 Institutions that had written huge volumes of swaps including aig an insurer were hit with bills they had thought would not all come at once An inquiry into the crisis causes judged that over-the-counter derivatives particularly credit-default swaps were a significant contributor In 2009 Charlie Munger the venerable second-in-command of Berkshire Hathaway an investment firm endorsed a ban The eu prohibited one way of using swaps As recently as 2018 the Vatican said credit-default swaps were “less acceptable from the perspective of ethics respectful of the truth and the common good”Yet the market today is unrecognisable from the one 15 years ago Back then it was roughly the same size as the market for foreign-exchange swaps Today it is not even a tenth as big Some 60% of the outstanding market now relates to credit-default-swap indices rather than a particular company bond This compares with 43% at the market peak Trading in index products is much more liquidThings are safer in other ways too The standardisation of credit-default-swap coupons has made it easier for the assets to be traded through clearing houses More than half of single-firm credit-default swaps and two-thirds of index ones are now cleared compared with 6% and 16% in mid-2010 when data collection began This reduces counterparty risk where investors fear that a dealer of derivatives might collapse and fail to honour their obligations This danger loomed large during the financial crisis Trading is now operating as the architects of the system would have hoped As inflation has surged and interest rates have climbed market activity has surged with interest in protection against defaults rising The trading volume of index credit-default swaps is up by 68% in the year to date compared with the same period last year With over two months to go this year is already the strongest on record for trading volumes since data collection began in 2013 A paper by Robert Czech of the Bank of England suggests that credit-default-swap contracts make the underlying corporate bonds more liquid too particularly at a time of rating downgrades when liquidity can otherwise dry up Research by Martin Oehmke of the London School of Economics and Adam Zawadowski of the Central European University comes to a similar conclusion They find that credit-default-swap markets provide an alternative venue for speculation and hedging activity to the underlying corporate bond market This enhances overall liquidityThere will almost certainly be jitters as more use is made of credit-default swaps Payouts can lead to protracted legal proceedings The recent payout on swaps against Russian sovereign debt was surprisingly straightforward given the trickiness caused by sanctions Holders received 44 cents on the dollar after a special auction to determine the contracts’ value Yet the significant changes to the market since the financial crisis appear to be bearing fruit As markets get choppy credit-default swaps are likely to play a positive role Pay no attention to the Vatican For more expert

One answer is that China conspicuous failures not least its ponzi-like property market and damaging “zero-covid” approach have obscured other areas of progress The economy is greener than it was Interest rates and the exchange rate are more flexible It has become easier for entrepreneurs to start a business and for foreign investors to move their money into China even as it has become harder for residents to get their money out China has replaced a clumsy turnover tax with a value-added tax It has allowed local governments to issue more bonds diminishing their need to raise money off the books And the country has successfully cut poverty and broadened its safety net A hard-luck storyThe reformers have also been unfortunate In Mr Xi second term they have had to contend with a trade war against America and the forever war against the covid-19 pandemic Mr Liu who led China protracted trade negotiations with the Trump administration was stretched thin America willingness to deny China access to vital technological imports also changed Mr Xi economic priorities He and his team could hardly be blamed for elevating self-reliance as a goal alongside opennessEven some of the reformers’ successes have had unwelcome side-effects China deleveraging campaign in 2016 is one example It succeeded in stopping runaway credit growth: the combined debt of China government households and non-financial companies grew little relative to the size of the country gdp in 2017 and 2018 But by cracking down on shadow banking China reformers made it harder for many private companies to obtain credit It is perhaps unfortunate that such an impressive cohort of reformers came to power at a time when macroeconomic stabilisation was a more urgent task than microeconomic liberalisationSome reforms have also backfired China restrictive limits on borrowing by property developers caused the housing slump which in turn exacerbated some of the financial risks the limits were designed to prevent An earlier attempt in 2015 to let the currency float more freely precipitated destabilising capital outflows These reforms as well as being clumsily executed were also poorly sequenced China eased capital controls before relaxing its grip on the yuan contrary to economic orthodoxy And by cracking down on the property market it has deprived local governments of much-needed income from land sales without having created an alternative source of revenue such as a real-estate taxIn some cases the sequence of reform was dictated by politics Introducing a nationwide property tax would be deeply unpopular Hence it has been repeatedly delayed Similarly the pacing of China currency reform was influenced by a largely symbolic goal: getting the yuan accepted by the imf as a “freely usable” international currency fit to be included in the organisation special-drawing-rights basket Reformers sometimes feel compelled to seize a window of political opportunity even if the timing is not economically ideal These compromises illustrate the deeper reason for the reformers’ failure Their initiatives have always been subordinate to Mr Xi broader political aims When economic development was the party overriding task the goals of the party matched the goals of economic reformers But under Mr Xi the party is pursuing another vision of national greatness in which economic efficiency is one goal among many Mr Xi wants the economy to be less susceptible to American pressure and more susceptible to party control It needs to be hardier and redder not merely bigger and better He wants qualified intelligent experienced cadres to implement this vision not their own After ten years of Mr Xi “I don’t think many people harbour the illusion that he going to unleash a wave of productivity-enhancing economic reforms with drive and vigour” says Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics a consultancy in Beijing But some nevertheless hope for a restoration of “pragmatism” he says They believe Mr Xi economic team can smooth his rougher edges and ensure orderliness in his policymaking Their job is to stop him “dashing around on campaigns to promote this and crack down on that” No one needs a crystal ball to know that after the party congress this month Xi Jinping will be the first name on the economic team sheet From the policymakers that join him investors expect not reform but restraint For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 13th 2022,Emerging markets look unusually resilient,The script is familiar A Federal Reserve bent on taming inflation mercilessly raises rates The dollar soars global financial conditions tighten and the world economy falls into a broad slowdown But this time there is a twist Where writers would normally pencil in an emerging-markets crisis there is instead an eerie calmListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor decades fast-growing middle-income countries have been a source of financial trouble In the early 1980s the Fed crusade against double-digit inflation sparked a Latin American debt crisis; in the 2010s the normalisation of policy after the global financial crisis rattled the “fragile five” Brazil India Indonesia South Africa and Turkey Much the same might have been expected during present tightening which is the most intense since the early 1980s In forecasts published on October 11th the imf again marked down its projections for global growth and warned that economies accounting for a third of global gdp are heading for downturns The world very poorest countries are on the ropes More than a billion people live in economies now facing severe distressAnd yet most big middle-income countries are weathering the storm The imf reckons that emerging economies will substantially outgrow rich ones this year and next despite a slowdown in China and a contraction in Russia While the euro pound and yen are tumbling against the dollar the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have managed a more graceful decline and the currencies of Brazil and Mexico have risen see chart 1 Emergency central-bank intervention is unfolding in London rather than BrasíliaThe resilience of the emerging world is in part a story of maturation Since the crises of the 1980s and 1990s local financial markets have grown deeper and banks better managed Policymaking has improved Officials have learned the hazards of careless budgeting and large current-account deficits Central banks are more independent and have adopted the inflation-targeting approaches used in the rich world This sophistication and care has demonstrated its value over the past two years Many middle-income central banks began raising rates well in advance of rich countries This prevented rising inflation from slipping out of control and also stopped destabilising currency declines Take Brazil which experienced hyperinflation as recently as the early 1990s but has worked in recent decades to establish the credibility and independence of its central bank When inflation leapt and the real wobbled early last year the central bank responded with aggressive rate rises amounting to a cumulative increase of almost 12 percentage points Inflation has fallen from a peak of 12% in April to below 8%; the currency has been among the world best performing Meanwhile in the rich world central banks that have fallen behind the Fed tightening schedule like the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have experienced vertiginous currency depreciations and have yet to see inflation peakEmerging-market foreign-exchange regimes have also improved These economies once relied on exchange-rate pegs to contain inflation and secure cheaper credit But the years of crisis encouraged a move in the direction of floating-rate regimes in which markets get more of a say over a currency value Now most governments only occasionally intervene to lean against undesirably fast or big moves Many have paired this with deeper foreign-exchange reserves During good times they purchased assets denominated in reserve currencies like dollars This slows the pace of their currencies’ appreciation and builds a pile of safe assets In 1998 global foreign-exchange reserves amounted to 5% of world gdp By 2020 that figure had risen to 15% representing a staggering $13trn Although Chinese reserves of more than $3trn account for a large chunk other emerging-market governments have built up formidable piles India totals over $500bn for instance and Brazil is worth more than $300bn see chart 2These reserves can be deployed to slow a currency depreciation when investor risk appetite drops This year India has sold $40bn-worth to keep the rupee decline modest and orderly Yet reserves are most valuable in the thick of a crisis when they can be used to pay for critical imports and meet hard-currency debt repayments Crucially they help to reassure foreign investors that obligations will be honouredAnd emerging economies have addressed their greatest weakness: an inability to borrow in their own currency Governments once had no choice but to accept loans denominated in other currencies This vulnerabilityreferred to as “original sin”could turn a drop in investor sentiment into a financial catastrophe Because a fall in the local currency increased the burden of foreign-currency debt economic weakness or nervy markets could set in motion a cycle of capital flight increased pressure to devalue and lost confidence in the creditworthiness of the government which often ended in chaotic default But after the global financial crisis bond yields in the rich world tumbled pushing investors to look for returns elsewhere This hunt combined with improved economic management in emerging markets allowed officials to shift borrowing to local-currency bonds see chart 3 In the mid-2000s some 46% of Indonesian public debt and 83% of Chilean debt was owed in a foreign currency By 2021 those figures had fallen to 23% and 32% The safety purchased by these innovations is impressive But in a forbidding economic climate emerging markets cannot afford a victory lap Although governments have borrowed more in their own currencies many companies have notand if global woes force large firms to seek bail-outs their foreign obligations could become their governments’ foreign obligations If worsening financial conditions prompt a flight to safety a Fed focused squarely on high American inflation may not ride to the world rescue with a torrent of emergency lending as in March 2020Stability can also lead to greater risk-taking The healthier financial position of emerging markets has allowed some to take on debt that would once have seemed too high even for rich countries India debt has risen to 84% of gdp;

 Oct 10th 2022,Three economists win the Nobel for their work on bank runs,When the global financial crisis struck 15 years ago economists were forced to respond to criticism that they had for decades ignored the banking system With its choices for this year Nobel prize Sweden Royal Academy of Sciences honoured three economists who had in fact spent the previous decades examining bank instability Research by Ben Bernanke chair of the Federal Reserve during the crisis and an academic before that Douglas Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip Dybvig of Washington University in St Louis was largely vindicated by the failure of the banks in 2008 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe three laureates’ central insight was that banks are not the neutral intermediaries between savers and borrowers that other economic models had assumed Instead they offer vital services to the wider economy: gathering information on borrowers providing a liquid means of saving and deciding to whom to extend credit From this insight flows an important conclusion: because banks are crucial to the economy they are also dangerous Mr Bernanke is best known as a central banker But it was his work at Stanford University that the committee cited They mentioned an article on economic history published in 1983 that looked at the causes of the Depression Unlike previous accounts Mr Bernanke emphasised the role of the banking system arguing that a self-sustaining cycle of bank runs caused the plunge in economic activity in the 1930s rather than just being a consequence of itIn this account Mr Bernanke focused on the role played by banks in providing credit The uncertainties inherent to lending and borrowing mean that such decisions require “information-gathering services” When banks failed in the 1930s new entrants could not easily replace them Unlike a grocer a new bank cannot simply move into its predecessor premises and set up shop Knowledge about borrowers is hard won This meant that farmers small firms and households all found credit more difficult to obtain during the Depression ensuring a vicious downturn A similar insight lies at the heart of the Diamond-Dybvig model of bank runs developed in 1983 by Mr Bernanke two fellow laureates Without banks the authors pointed out ordinary savers would be forced to invest directly in capital projects with long-term payouts These projects would then need to be cancelled whenever savers faced an unforeseen cost that meant they needed to dip into their savings Banks allow savers to pool their money and for these pooled savings to finance long-term investments Crucially savers may withdraw their cash at will which is known as liquidity In exchange banks take a slice of profits The process is called “maturity transformation” as it involves the transformation of an asset with a short maturity such as a bank deposit into a longer one such as a business loan The provision of this service makes banks vulnerable If lots of savers try to withdraw money at the same time perhaps because of a rumour that a bank will be unable to satisfy its creditors the bank will be forced to terminate its long-term investments and sell assets at deep discounts Such losses could cause the bank to collapse as happened in 2008 when a downturn in the American housing market spiralled into a system-wide banking crisisThere is an escape from this problem however which Messrs Diamond and Dybvig demonstrated by employing game theory It is rational for depositors to run on a bank so long as they believe others will But such a course of action becomes fruitless if they believe others will remain at home A system of insuring deposits such as the one instituted by the American government in 1933 or by a central bank acting as a “lender of last resort” can prevent runs from happening in the first placeThis insight was not entirely novel Walter Bagehot a former editor of The Economist suggested in 1873 that central banks could avoid financial panics by acting as a lender of last resort Likewise “It A Wonderful Life” a film released in 1946 and mentioned in the Nobel citation materials demonstrated both the mechanics of a bank run and the importance of confidence The hero soothes depositors with calming rhetoric and a capital injection from his honeymoon savings The “fundamental impact” of the laureates’ work in the committee words was to offer mathematically consistent models of this informal knowledge Their contribution perhaps was not to discover something new about the world but to communicate something that had been all too easily forgotten by other economists For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 6th 2022,Why China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan,In 1988 paul krugman a Nobel-prizewinning economist wrote that it was “fairly likely” the world would soon shift away from freely floating exchange rates Governments would instead adopt a system of “broad target zones” promising to stop their currencies wandering too far above or below a fixed exchange rateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHe was wrongbut a version of this future can be seen in China Each morning its central bank sets an exchange rate for the yuan known as the “fix” China currency can float 2% above or below this rate each day The zone is narrower than Mr Krugman expected and its mid-point moves each morning in discrete steps Yet it is similar enough that economists at Hamburg University have called it a staircase-shaped “moving Krugman band system”The stairs have been steep of late Since mid-April the yuan has declined by about 10% against the dollar; a decline slowed but not stopped by the morning fix On its way down the currency has passed psychologically important thresholds In August it crossed 68 to the dollar close to the level at which the yuan was pegged after the global financial crisis of 2008-09 On September 26th the central bank set the fix at more than seven yuan to the dollar for the first time since the early stages of the covid-19 pandemicThe reason for this descent is clear America Federal Reserve has raised interest rates aggressively to curb inflation To stabilise the yuan China central bank could raise interest rates in tandem But tighter monetary policy would be at odds with the needs of its weak economy which is hampered by a property slump and draconian covid controlsWhat is less clear is where the bottom of the staircase lies and how sure-footed the descent will be Some analysts fear a repeat of 2015 when a poorly executed devaluation of the yuan provoked capital outflows that further undermined the currency But a rerun is unlikely The yuan is no longer overvalued Its target zone is better managed and its capital controls are better enforced In the past China kept its currency anchored to the dollar because it feared that a conspicuous drop would trigger a run on its currency The yuan decline against the dollar is now less likely to become disorderly For that reason China will try less hard to prevent it In assessing China currency choices economists sometimes invoke the “impossible trinity” A country might want exchange-rate stability monetary independence and free capital flows but it can have only two of these Rich countries typically make clear-cut choices As Joshua Aizenman of the University of Southern California has pointed out emerging economies are more ambivalent Many have adopted mixed positions embracing none of the objectives in full nor rejecting any entirely By imposing limited controls on capital say they can provide some stability to their exchange rate without entirely forgoing monetary independence China has clung to exchange-rate stability more than most The yuan has been less volatile than India rupee let alone South Africa rand or Brazil real But China has also adopted tighter capital controls especially since 2015 This can be inefficient and inconvenient It is however not outlawed by the impossible trinityChina can also take comfort from the economic fundamentals Despite its insulation from market forces its exchange rate is reasonably well priced Adjusted for inflation it is about 10% below its fair value according to the Institute of International Finance It has remained stable this year against a broader basket of currencies If only the fundamentals applied it ought not to plummetUnfortunately financial markets are not respectful of such calculations “Few will heed fundamentalsin times of turbulence and turmoil” as Zhou Xiaochuan then China central-bank governor put it in 2016 Expectations of yuan declines can become self-fulfilling regardless of the underlying state of the economyMr Krugman showed that target zones if credible could ameliorate this problem by converting speculators into stabilisers As the exchange rate reaches the bottom of the zone its room for further declines is limited Knowing that speculators would push it back to the middle The mere prospect of intervention by the authorities could make actual intervention unnecessaryThat did not work in China in 2015 partly because of the way its stairs were built Each morning fix was supposed to reflect the currency value at the end of the previous trading session Thus any speculative declines during trading could be embedded in the following morning fix Within any single day the zone might constrain the speculators But from one day to the next the speculators could move the zoneIn need of a fixTo restore stability and credibility China sold more than $700bn of foreign-exchange reserves in 2015-16 and enforced its capital controls more zealously It introduced a mysterious “counter-cyclical factor” in its calculation of the morning fix intended to offset any speculative momentum It also imposed a reserve requirement on banks that made it costlier to bet against the yuan That requirement was removed in 2020 only to be restored last monthHaving taken these measures China now seems more confident that the yuan can fall against the dollar without the fall becoming self-reinforcing For this reason the yuan now seems less anchored to America currency Economists have looked at how faithfully the yuan mimics movements in the dollar against other currencies In the dark days of 2015 it moved one to one In recent years the dollar influence has steadily declined according to Chen Zhang of the National University of Singapore and colleagues falling from one to about 03 China might cling more tightly to the dollar in a period of great financial stress But it is otherwise unlikely to intervene heavily to defend any particular value of the yuan to the dollar The country policymakers do not mind if the yuan walks steadily down the stairs Just as long as it does not tumble Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Economists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep

Several times in the recent past the market has broken down In 2014 a “flash rally” led to wild swings in prices for no clear reason In 2019 rates spiked in the “repo” market in which Treasuries can be swapped for cash overnight In March 2020 extreme illiquidity led yields to spike even though in times of panic they usually fall as investors rush to safe assets Now issues are cropping up again: measures of volatility have jumped to levels last seen in 2020 and bid-ask spreads are widening The problem stems from the fact that the Treasury market has doubled in size over the past decade even as its infrastructure has shrunk Trading is carried out by primary dealers designated institutions which are mostly big banksand regulatory requirements now constrain them The leverage ratio which limits the value of assets banks can hold relative to their capital does not care whether the asset is super-safe Treasuries or subprime mortgage debt Thus when a client calls asking to sell a bond banks must find a client who wants to buy it rather than holding it as inventory for when another client calls In times of stress this system gets overwhelmed The fixes fall into three buckets: let the banks trade more bonds with investors let investors trade more bonds with each other or let investors trade or swap more bonds with the Federal Reserve Start with letting the banks do more The solution would be to exempt Treasuries and other safe assets like bank reserves from inclusion in leverage ratios The Fed and other bank regulators did this for a year from March 2020 to help ease market chaos The logic behind the move was sound enough Treasuries are not risky assets likely to default and so they do not require much capital to be held against them Still the leverage ratio is appealing because it is simple to administer and cannot be gamed And with Democratic bank regulators in charge who do not want to appear to be undoing financial regulation the idea is a non-starter How about letting investors deal more with one another? Portfolio managers at pimco a large bond investment firm have proposed that investors should trade on a platform where asset managers dealers and non-bank liquidity providers can trade on a “level playing field with equal access to information” akin to how stocks are traded This could be good if it is actually possible Matching buyers and sellers of Treasuries is harder than matching buyers and sellers of stocks All shares in Microsoft are the same; there are dozens of Treasuries that have roughly five years to maturityA final fix would be to let investors do more with the Fed Last year the central bank created a standing repo facility which allows a Treasury to be swapped overnight for cash But the facility is only for primary dealers which do not always pass on the liquidity Opening it to more participants would address this problem It would also expose the Fed to a range of riskier counterpartiesbut that could be mitigated by requiring firms to swap a greater value in Treasuries than the central bank gives out in cashThe problem is not a shortage of plausible reforms It is that none of them have been implemented The heady bull market has collided with the reality of high inflation and much higher interest rates Financial markets have already entered a new phase in which volatility stress and fear have returned Any grand plans to overhaul the Treasury market cannot be implemented on the fly in the midst of a burgeoning crisisIf the Treasury market seizes up againas the market for British government bonds did after ministers announced a package of unfunded tax cuts on September 23rdthe task of fixing it will fall on the Fed and its bond-buying schemes Relaunching asset purchases at the same time as raising rates to combat inflation would be very uncomfortable Since regulators failed to fix the Treasury market when they had the chance they may end up with little choiceRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Investment banks are sharpening the axe Sep 29thHow to rebrand stockmarket indices Sep 22ndWhy investors should forget about delayed gratification Sep 15thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

China is running down its stockpiles in a bid to satiate its thirsty refiners The volume of oil on water may be rising but that is only thanks to the longer tanker journeys that are required as the market adjusts to sanctions rather than growth in floating storage notes Giovanni Serio of Vitol a trader The problem opec+ faces is that its credibility is in tatters Even the cut announced on October 5th is not what it seems Its members have failed to invest in production leading to a gap between target and actual output see chart In reality the cut will apply only to members that are hitting or are near to their targets Ehsan Khoman of MUFG a bank expects the revision to deliver a real cut of up to 11m b/dThe tactic is nevertheless workingat least for now The oil price has risen by 11% since September 26th when rumours of the cartel plans first emerged That makes the reduction worthwhile even for Saudi Arabia which will trim its output by 5% but ought to benefit from an increase in price twice the size Jorge León a former opec analyst now at Rystad Energy a consultancy reckons that Brent could surpass $100 by the end of the year After the meeting the Saudi energy minister said that unless the market changes the supply curbs will remain until the end of 2023 But the decision is not without risk opec+ market share is yet to recover from huge cuts it made in 2020 to shore up prices amid a collapse in demand Trimming production again may further erode the cartel market share The cut is also a snub to President Joe Biden who recently visited Saudi Arabia in an attempt to cajole it into pumping more before tough midterm elections next month The White House accused the cartel of “aligning with Russia” and announced that America would release another 10m barrels from its strategic reserve next month The decision also provides fuel to nopec a congressional bill that would allow the cartel to be sued under antitrust law although it will have to overcome opposition from lawmakers and oil firms who fear tit-for-tat measures opec+ loss of market share should be partly reversed when it eventually cranks up output again Thus it is the decision impact on demand with higher prices likely to further reduce consumer appetite that will probably do more damage to opec+ position Cutting output in a tight market also creates more volatility not lessand the extra uncertainty will discourage investors and lenders reducing liquidity in the paper oil markets The decision may also reignite diplomatic tensions within the cartel Since quotas no longer reflect actual output the latest cuts are being shouldered by just a handful of membersIraq Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the uaethat were already prevented from producing quite as much as they ideally would The uae which secured a small increase in July but plans to expand its production capacity from 4m b/d today to 5m b/d in 2025 will almost certainly agitate for a rejig in future negotiations This will be resisted by underperformers such as Angola and Nigeria says Robin Mills of Qamar Energy another consultancy in the hope that they can one day rebuild their capacityIronically Russia could offer the cartel a solution The country has long been a staunch advocate of higher production But its output is now likely to fall both soon as a result of a European embargo set to start in December and in the long run as sanctions prevent it from getting access to vital partners people and parts Saudi Arabia and the uae are in bed with “a weakening business partner” says Karen Young of Columbia University Russia will be reluctant to give away some of its quota The question is whether in a world where it has ever fewer friends doing so is a price worth paying to remain inside the tent For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 4th 2022,Financial markets are in trouble Where will the cracks appear?,It is hard not to feel a sense of foreboding As the Federal Reserve has tightened policy asset prices have plunged Stocks as measured by the Wilshire 5000 all-cap index have shed $12trn of market capitalisation since January Another $7trn has been wiped off bonds which have lost 14% of their value Some $2trn of crypto market-cap has vanished over the past year House prices adjust more slowly but are falling Mortgage rates have hit 7% up from 3% last year And this is all in Americaone of the world strongest economiesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRising rates will slow the American economy and should break the back of inflation But what else will they break? Since the Federal Reserve raised rates again on September 22nd global markets have been in turmoil When the British government announced unfunded tax cuts a day later fire-sales by pension funds caused the yield on government bonds or “gilts” to spiral out of control Contagion then spread to the American Treasury market which is as volatile and illiquid as it was at the start of covid-19 The cost to insure against the default of Credit Suisse a global bank has risen sharply These ructions indicate the world is entering a new phase in which financial markets no longer just reflect the pain of adjusting to the new economic contextpricing in higher rates and lower growthbut now also spread pain of their own The worst pain is felt when financial institutions fail There are two ways they do so: illiquidity or insolvency Tighter monetary policy is likely to prompt or reveal both It is illiquidity that comes firstand it has well and truly arrived Take the British pension funds They use a strategy called “liability-driven investing” to hedge against interest-rate moves When rates shot up they faced margin calls which they met by selling gilts Yields moved so fast that this became a fire-sale with prices spiralling downwards The Bank of England had to step in to buy bonds At least American pension funds do not treat their liabilities in the same way meaning they are unlikely to face similar blow upsBut pension funds are not the only bond holders that may face liquidity issues On October 4th the imf sounded the alarm about open-ended bonds funds which hold $41trn in assets a quarter of financial assets outside the banking system Investors can sell their holdings once a day “but it may take fund managers several days to sell assets to meet these redemptions especially when financial markets are volatile” warned the IMF That exposes them to moves in market pricing Outflows are amassing Investors have pulled 8% of their assets from these funds this year Credit costs are rising quickly as would be expected in such circumstances Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley a bank highlights how abrupt the shift has been: “In the most recent senior-loan-officers survey every single question they asked bankers about financial conditions flipped to tightening all at once I have never seen that before” Yet the real problem is when credit is unavailableno matter the price British traders report there were “no bids” for gilts in the days after the government announced its plans Measures of liquidity in the Treasury market have deteriorated too “We are seeing what happened in March 2020 again The same Treasury bonds are trading at different prices bid-ask spreads are widening” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford University Strategists at Bank of America describe their index of credit stress as “borderline critical” Stockmarkets have been just as turbulent but they have at least continued to function “You might not have liked the price you were seeing” says Tal Cohen of Nasdaq a stock exchange “but you were always seeing a price” He has yet to witness “demand destruction” the thinning out of the order book that occurs when buyers and sellers begin to pull their orders en masse This is despite the fact that Bank of America strategists think markets have fallen to levels at which losses may be forcing funds to sell assets to raise cash accelerating the sell-off Illiquidity in credit markets is enough of a problem It can morph into a total lack of lending Last week British banks rushed to pull mortgages from their proverbial shelves If this dynamic gets out of hand it can typically be solved by central banks stepping in and operating as a lenders of last resort as the Bank of England did The risk of doing so is not trivial however Such an intervention employs quantitative easing buying securities using central-bank moneythe path used by central banks to ease monetary policy Thus it might undermine faith in central bankers’ commitment to fighting inflation Market-watchers now wonder whether all this pressure will lead to insolvencies which happen when the value of an institution assets falls below its liabilities It is the fate which befell insurers including AIG and banks including Lehman Brothers in 2008 Homeowners across America defaulted on their loans meaning mortgage-backed securities assets many firms had bought were no longer worth anything close to their original purchase price Insolvency is fatal and only resolvable by bankruptcy or bail-outs The current tension is the first big test of a new-look financial system Regulators have sought to make systemically important institutionsas Lehman Brothers surely would have been designatedtoo safe to fail They have done this by compelling firms designated as such to follow stringent capital liquidity and risk-taking rules as well as by stress-testing them in hypothetical economic breakdowns Regulators have also tried to reduce opacity and counterparty riskthe channels through which fears about Lehman morphed into suspicion of the entire banking system The result is that there are layers of protection around the financial system most important institutions At the heart of markets are clearing houses which settle trades in stocks and derivatives between their members mostly big banks To join a clearing house a member must post an “initial margin” in case of default; that margin can climb if markets move The system is stress-tested against the default of even the clearing houses’ largest members such as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup The banks which stand between the clearing houses and other financial institutions are also in better shape The issues that precipitated the fall of Lehman Brothers were that the firm did not have enough capital at times leading up to its demise it held capital worth just 3% of assets had taken on too much borrowing holding debt worth 30 times its equity had a dubious business model making enormous bets on the American housing market and had taken on vast amounts of risk Today there are 30 banks designated as systemically important by regulators some 28 of which are in the kbw Nasdaq Global Bank Index which tracks bank stocks These 28 banks are funded with capital worth 13% of their risk-weighted assets see chart 1 and have debt worth five times their equity Despite this they do not get an entirely clean bill of health: some business models look fragile On average the banks returned profits worth 9% of their equity last quarter but the worst other than Credit Suisse returned just 4% It is hard to know whether any have taken huge risks “American banks are unequivocally much stronger” says a bank boss Few are making such statements about European banks and certainly nobody is about Credit Suisse The firm had a return on equity of minus 14% last quarter its share price has tumbled and its market capitalisation is now just $12bn Yet even Credit Suisse is not near a Lehman-style collapse It is funded with capital worth 14% of its risk-weighted assets Although Credit Suisse credit-default swaps which act like insurance against default have leapt see chart 2 they still suggest the chance of default is in the low to mid-single digitsBig banks head into the new era fortified But the regulation that has strengthened their defences has also diminished them High capital demands make it hard for them to compete Because they must add risk weights to all kinds of assets they now hold only boring stuff Leverage ratios constrain their size By contrast financial institutions that are not systemically important are unencumbered by these rules The impact can be seen on balance sheets In 2010 after the financial crisis banks held $115trn of financial assets Other financial institutions such as pension funds insurers and alternative asset managers held roughly the same amount In the years since the non-banks’ slice has grown By the end of 2020 they held assets worth $227trn a quarter more than the banks Similarly four-fifths of American mortgages came from banks before the financial crisis Today only around half do and most of these are sold on to investorsThus the dodgy stuff is probably in other institutions Which ones? In 2007 problems started in real estate This time Americans have far less mortgage debt but the sheer pace of price growth in residential housing suggests some buyers will face difficulties Indeed three-quarters of those who bought in the past two years regret their decision Other forms of real estate are also vulnerable Firms are downsizing their offices to adapt to working from home posing problems for highly leveraged commercial developers Charles Bendit of Taconic Partners a developer in New York notes that lots have opted for floating-rate debt meaning their debt-servicing costs have already doubled Michael Burry who shot to fame in 2008 after shorting mortgage-backed securities is concerned by unsecured consumer finance given the growth of “buy-now-pay-later” providers and the ease with which consumers have been able to tap credit-card lines Goldman Sachs a bank ventured into consumer credit in 2019 helping to launch the Apple card It now has an unusually high default rate of 3% over the past six months Ms Graseck of Morgan Stanley points out that because this is an interest rate-shock driven cycle trouble will probably first arrive in the loans that reprice to higher rates quickly: “Floating rate debt like credit cards is immediate then commercial real estate autos and eventually mortgages”One of the fastest-growing parts of private credit has been that offered to software-service firms notes Seth Bernstein boss of AllianceBernstein an asset manager “These have been fantastic cash machines because they have subscription models” The cash flows they provide have been used to secure financing meaning many firms are now highly leveraged They are also untested in a downturn Mr Bernstein compares the situation to the securitisation of housing debt in that there is very little information available about the debt It is companies more broadly that appear most at risk They owe debts worth 80% of gdp compared with 65% in 2007 A third of American corporate debt is rated BBB the lowest investment-grade rating Firms downgraded any further are not eligible for many investors’ portfolios Defaults are now arriving Bausch Health a health-care provider gave up the ghost on September 30th taking the default rate for high-yield issuers to its highest since June 2020 There is little to no appetite for fresh high-yield debtbanks that agreed to fund Elon Musk Twitter takeover in April will struggle to issue it without taking lossesWho holds these bad assets? Financial firms that have grown lots over the past 15 years are the first place to look Alternative assets which include private equity real estate and hedge funds have grown from just 8% of total financial assets in 2006 to 15% now They have taken paper losses of 11% on their investments this year a much smaller fall than in the public markets This might reflect sensible investmentor an unwillingness to adjust to reality Firms that have escaped the full weight of regulation are another place to look The Financial Stability and Oversight Council an outfit established by the Treasury to watch important financial institutions tried to claim oversight of the big insurance companies including MetLife AIG and Prudential But MetLife won a lawsuit to have the designation overturned and the council then rescinded its designations of the restIf lots of investors are washed out as they would be if a non-bank financial institution failed well “who cares?” quips one bank boss Given reforms since the last financial crisis it seems unlikely that there will be failures of institutions that are so big and important that governments need to bail them out The systemic institutions will survive another event like the blow-ups of the hedge funds LTCM in 1998 and Archegos in 2021 But that does not make life any easier for central banks It is their job to tighten policy enough to cool inflation without causing seriously disruptive activity in financial markets And it is looking increasingly difficult to do both For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 3rd 2022,Credit Suisse and the hunt for the weakest link in global finance,As interest rates rise and asset prices slump investors are scrambling to identify the weakest links in the global financial system Every bear market produces national and corporate victims who get skewered In the 1997-98 rout Thailand economy imploded as did LTCM a hedge fund Iceland and Lehman Brothers were victims in the 2008-09 slump Today one country has already been picked off: Britain where the currency has fallen and the central bank has had to intervene in the bond market to bail out the pension system whose overseers had foolishly made vast bets on continued low volatility Now some believe an institutional victim of the great 2022 sell-off in markets has been spotted: Credit Suisse a venerable Swiss firm that spans wealth-and-asset management private banking and investment banking Its shares have fallen by 55% this year and its credit-default swaps which measure default risk have risen These two red lights will be familiar to anyone who witnessed Wall Street firms struggling in 2008-09 as will the statements by Credit Suisse managers that the bank has a strong liquidity and capital position This year version of a confidence scare at a bank comes with a new twist too: a swirl of malicious mad and made-up rumours on Twitter and elsewhere Welcome to the too-big-to-fail problem in the social-media ageSo does the claim on the message boards that Credit Suisse is “next” make sense? At a high level the idea that a big bank shadow bank or investment firm might be in trouble is plausible The financial system has become habituated to 15 years of rock-bottom interest rates The hunt for yield has led insurers and other funds to stuff portfolios with long-duration assets that are ultra-sensitive to rising rates American banks have retreated from lending as regulations have grown tighter and instead a system of market-based credit has emerged that deals in trillions of dollars of low-quality debt There have been some medium-sized blowups already including of Archegos a hedge fund and Greensill a lenderFurthermore Credit Suisse has been poorly run and struggling for some time It has suffered repeated risk-management and compliance scandals including being exposed to losses from Archegos and Greensill Its top management ranks have been a revolving door Yet in most other respects it does not look like the epicentre of a financial explosion in the way that say Lehman or AIG an insurer were Instead of rampant growth fuelled by hubris Credit Suisse balance sheet has shrunk continuously over the past decade in dollar terms as it has downsized itself into the second tier of global finance Today it is the 54th biggest listed financial firm in the world by assets Its problems are idiosyncratic and to a degree an expression of management caution rather than recklessness It owns a sub-par investment banking unit that needs to be shrunk or shut down Based on the second-quarter results this division eats up 30% of its risk-adjusted assets and has annualised costs of SFr8bn $8bn It is largely to blame for the firm overall quarterly pre-tax loss of SFr117bn and awful return on equity of minus 14% Bitter experience from firms such as Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland teaches that shrinking an investment bank is a bit like decommissioning a nuclear reactor: dangerous and expensive Star bankers leave and business dries up faster than you can cut costs and quit long-term contracts leading to losses Investors’ main concern has been that these potential losses might be so big that Credit Suisse would have to raise equity to ensure it had enough capital to support its ongoing businesses which are fairly healthyWorries about financial firms can be self-fulfilling as counterparties charge a higher risk-premium to lend to or deal with the firm making it uncompetitive In order to bring down its borrowing costs Credit Suisse will have to convince investors that it has a better proposal for shrinking its investment bank without incurring massive upfront losses It plans to announce this on October 27th But so far at least Credit Suisse is not an example of a business model which in its spectacular excesses and implosion encapsulates a broader madness in the markets Instead it is an example of a relatively weak firm coming under pressure as financial conditions tighten and the economy flags There will be many more of these in many other industries Meanwhile the hunt in the markets for “the big one” will go on For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 2nd 2022,America economy is too strong for its own good,Two days after the latest interest-rate rise the seven governors of the Federal Reserve met with some businessfolk Any misgivings about the effects of tighter monetary policy would have been quickly dispelled Cara Walton of Harbour Results a consultancy spoke of a plastics processor who hired 14 new employees only for a mere three to show up on their first day and one of those to quit before lunch Cheetie Kumar a restaurateur said her peers were struggling to make rent as food and labour bills mounted Tom Henning of Cash-Wa a distribution company explained his firm was passing costs onto customers Demand was holding up he said thanks to the amount of money “floating out there in the economy”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMisgivings may however have crept back in as the governors watched the markets over the past fortnight The central bank goal is to tame inflation which is running at more than 8% year on year just shy of a four-decade high The realisation that it is still far from that goal and that monetary tightening will thus continue is causing havoc American stocks have fallen for three consecutive quarters and sharply recently Bond prices are tumbling reflecting tremors in the credit markets The ratcheting up of rates in America is driving the dollar appreciation adding to inflationary pressure elsewhere and impelling other central banks to follow the Fed lead no matter the state of their economies On September 30th Lael Brainard the Fed vice chair called for her fellow governors to proceed “deliberately” a word denoting caution in the central bank argot She also said the Fed would take its international impact into account This was an acknowledgment of the risks of the current approachit was not an indication that the central bank is about to change tack The Fed simply cannot ignore the strength of the domestic economy Even with the financial upheaval America economy is straining at its limits in critical dimensions In the labour market there are nearly two jobs available for every unemployed person Wages up roughly 7% compared with a year earlier are rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s according to the Atlanta Fed Although house prices declined month on month in August new home sales jumped confounding expectations Corporate profits are at their highest in decades as a share of gdp Despite higher rates consumer confidence has been climbing This constitutes a serious challenge for America central bankers The more resilient the economy the harder they will have to push to rein in inflation There is always a lag between shifts in monetary policy and their impact on real activity; recent rate rises will inevitably take a toll on the American economy over the coming year Yet additional jumbo rate rises remain on the cards see chart 1 heightening the risk of a monetary mistake and an eventual recession To get a sense of why despite the brewing trouble the Fed is still hawkish it is crucial to understand why the economy has remained insulated this far Fuel in the tankThe most obvious factor explaining this insulation also explains America inflation: the government was a lot more aggressive than others in stimulating the economy during the covid-19 pandemic America primary budget deficitthe difference between government spending and revenues excluding interest paymentsaveraged 105% in 2020 and 2021 more than triple its level before the pandemic and higher than all other big rich countries Formally this stimulus ended some time ago The last big short-term fiscal package was President Joe Biden American Rescue Plan ARP in March last year But in reality stimulus is still working its way through the system Hefty dollops of ARP cash are only just hitting the economy States were granted about $200bn in direct emergency funding In August they had yet to draw on a fifth of that And they are still doling out the funding they have claimed In the past couple of weeks alone Louisville Kentucky announced it would spend ARP funds on affordable housing; Monroe Country New York directed some of its money to health services; and Cumberland Country Tennessee splashed out on water and sewer projectsEven more important is how the stimulus continues to puff up the balance sheets of both people and firms Households sit on about $2trn in excess savings relative to their pre-pandemic norm They are now beginning to eat into this buffersavings rates are well down this year But the reserves have enabled them to spend at a decent clip even as inflation has eroded their incomes It has been a similar story for businesses At the start of the third quarter they had about $28trn of cash in hand down from the start of the year but about a quarter more than before the pandemic They have also taken advantage of robust demand to pass on inflated input costs to customers protecting their margins and then some Post-tax corporate profits reached 12% of GDP in the second quarter the highest since at least the 1940s So long as companies are making profits they look to hire not fire workersNor has growth been hindered as it has in Europe by soaring energy costs following Russia invasion of Ukraine Indeed America has in one sense benefited from the invasion Exports of both crude oil and petroleum products are at an all-time high In net terms America has exported about 1m barrels a day of crude and petroleum products since Russia invasion of Ukraineall the more remarkable given that America was a net importer to the tune of 10m barrels a day at the start of the century The boom in oil-export earnings has contributed to a narrowing of America trade deficit which may flatter its growth figures over the rest of this yearAmerican consumers have been considerably less enthusiastic about higher prices at the pump If they compared themselves with their peers in Europe they might be more sanguine Natural-gas prices have historically been a smidgen higher in Europe than America These days they are about five times higher Europe has been gradually cut off from Russia its main gas supplier; America is awash with its own energy It has only limited liquefaction capacity which is needed for exports meaning the gas it releases from the ground is mostly consumed domestically In Europe monetary tightening is compounded by the negative shock from soaring energy prices which is why forecasters expect a deeper recession In America the Fed can more or less look beyond the ructions in the energy marketsHouse correctionSooner or later continued rate rises will drag on the American economy That after all is the Fed intention The most rate-sensitive sectors are already being hit Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have reached 7% the highest in more than a decade A steep rise in credit-card balances suggests that some households are starting to exhaust their savings Higher interest rates will only make debts more onerous Corporate profits also look set to flagone reason for the recent stock-market plungeNevertheless a slow steady return to normality after covid acts as something of a buffer against these dangers Take the property market The inventory of homes available for sale remains very low by historical standards in part because the supply of building materials just like other goods has been badly constrained over the past few years A leap in mortgage rates would usually be expected to lead to a precipitous slowdown in construction activity This time though builders are still building trying to work through the backlog of unfinished homesMeanwhile goods consumption shot up during the pandemic as people bought new sofas bigger televisions and fancier exercise bikes for their homes Now they are returning to cruises and concerts see chart 2 This shift matters for the job market because services tend to be more labour-intensive Even if consumers spend less in aggregate they are spending more on the kinds of things that require lots of workers boosting employmentSpread over the entire economy this is a powerful trend America workforce today is roughly the same size as in 2019 Its composition is however very different There are 1m more workers in transport and warehousing reflecting the rise and rise of online shopping At the other end of the spectrum more than 1m workers have left the leisure and hospitality sectors over the past three years According to the National Restaurant Association a lobby group roughly two in three restaurants are understaffed Thus the slowdown in growth may lead to a smaller rise in unemployment than would otherwise have been expected Companies suffering from worker shortages have little fat to trimIn one sense this resilience is to be welcomed It implies that a recession if one arrives is likely to be mild Yet the Fed is determined to get inflation down and is focused on wage growth as a proxy for underlying price pressures Continued labour-market tightness therefore inclines the central bank towards a tougher longer bout of monetary tighteningThe Fed has already raised rates by a full three percentage points this year its steepest increase in four decades As turmoil sweeps through financial markets some economists have criticised the central bank for going too far too fast Some Fed officials also seem to be getting cold feet But their hawkish colleagues have the upper hand after a year of upside surprises The baseline expectation among investors is that the Fed will deliver at least another percentage point of rate increases before the end of the year That may well be a conservative guess Even after half a year of monetary tightening and a slowdown in growth the economy still suffers from a shortfall of supply and a surfeit of demandmost especially for workers In the face of such a mismatch the only direction for interest rates is up For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Global rate rises are happening on an unprecedented scale,The great tightening began in the spring of 2021 when a handful of central banks in Latin America and central Europe began putting up interest rates to calm their wobbling currencies and rein in inflation By the end of the year a few rich countries like Norway and South Korea had joined in the action Over the course of this year nearly every major economy has jammed on the brakes In the past five decades policy has never tilted so overwhelmingly towards rate rises see chartListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs the pace of tightening has increased growing numbers of economists have warned that this rapid and synchronous but largely unco-ordinated policymaking has the makings of trouble Maurice Obstfeld a former chief economist at the IMF recently argued that central banks’ failure to consider the global effects of their policies puts the world economy at risk of a “historic” slowdown While any given rate rise may be justifiable together they could have a greater effect than anticipatedRising inflation is a consequence of too much money chasing after a constrained supply of goods and services Rate-raising central banks set out to slow growth by dampening spending but in a globalised economy spending flows across borders When one central bank tries to quash demand it affects consumption of foreign goods as wellin effect helping other central banks to manage their inflation problems If such spillovers are not taken into account the global economy will slow by more than central banks had individually aimed to achieveFinancial flows work in parallel with this process A rate rise in one country may attract money from investors elsewhere causing the currency to strengthen This means a reduction in import costs which may help to cool domestic inflation But other economies then face higher import bills which exacerbates their inflation problems Unco-ordinated policy tightening can become its own sort of currency war in which each country works to shift the burden of inflation elsewhere with the net result being too much tighteningThe world biggest co-ordination problem however may be less one of every-central-bank-for-itself and more one in which a single dominant central bankAmerica Federal Reservecalls a tune which others must follow like it or not The dollar outsized sway in the global financial system grants it a powerful role in driving global financial cycles A recent paper from Mr Obstfeld and Haonan Zhou of Princeton University notes that monetary tightening in America is strongly associated with an appreciating dollar and a deterioration in a number of global economic and financial measures The Fed commitment to returning American inflation to 2% leaves it little room to accommodate other economies It may welcome rate rises elsewhere as a helpful contribution to America inflation fight even if countries begin falling like dominoes into recession Indeed the more spare capacity is created in other economies and the greater the downward pressure that places on prices globally the less unemployment may need to rise in America in order to achieve the Fed aims The world has become much more financially integrated since 1971 when John Connally then Treasury secretary said to representatives of the world other large economies that “the dollar is our currency but it your problem” As interest rates across the world spiral upward in an unco-ordinated manner the probability that any economy emerges from this experience unscathed sinks ever lower For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Economists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work,Milton friedman a Nobel-prizewinning economist was an early fan of floating currencies The case for flexible exchange rates he once pointed out is the same as the argument for daylight-saving time In theory people could start their summer days an hour earlier without any change in the clocks In practice it is easier to change the time than to change everyone habits By a similar logic whenever there is a shortfall in demand for a country goods and assets it is easier to let one price the exchange rate drop than it is to cut all of a country other prices instead Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFriedman made his analogy in the sedate 1950s when exchange rates seldom changed In today more volatile markets the clocks can be brutal The yen has fallen by 20% against the dollar this year the South Korean won by 17% and India rupee by 9% After Kwasi Kwarteng Britain chancellor unveiled fresh tax cuts on September 23rd the restless pound fell close to parity with the dollar It was as wrenching as an alarm in the middle of a dream In the face of such discomfort policymakers are often tempted to intervene in the currency markets Japan finance ministry has tried to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998 selling foreign currencies in exchange for its own The Reserve Bank of India has also acted selling more than $40bn since the beginning of July by some estimates South Korea finance minister has said the authorities will review “contingency plans” to stop the won falling so fast Some economists have begun to look up how much Britain has stashed away in its foreign-exchange reserves Not a lot Friedman thought currency defences were either unnecessary or impossible If the shortfall in demand was large and lasting intervention would only delay the inevitable since the country would run out of foreign-exchange reserves If the shortfall was small and fleeting intervention was unnecessary Instead of buying a temporarily cheapened currency the government could rely on speculators to do the job since they would profit whenever the currency regained its footing Intervention was necessary only if the government was better at spotting a temporary misalignment than financial speculators whose livelihoods depended on it Early studies of intervention reinforced this scepticism In 1982 the G7 commissioned a report which concluded that currency intervention had little durable effect There was unusual consensus among economists that currency intervention was not an “effective or lasting” instrument as Kathryn Dominguez of the University of Michigan and Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard later pointed outBut more recent work has overturned this consensus thanks both to theoretical and empirical advances The longer-term impact of intervention can be hard to discern because central banks do not step into the currency markets at random They sell foreign reserves when the currency is weakening and buy when it is under pressure to strengthen And so a naive look at the data might suggest that intervention backfires: reserve sales are associated with a weaker currency just as firefighters are associated with fires One response is to look at currency interventions that are bigger or smaller than would be expected If a blaze attracts more firefighters than it would normally warrant the extra firefighters will probably be associated with a shorter better contained conflagration That is one of several approaches taken by Andrew Filardo of the Hoover Institution as well as Gaston Gelos and Thomas McGregor of the IMF in a paper published in June They concluded that if a currency is undervalued by 10% sales of foreign-exchange reserves worth about 01% of GDP can strengthen it by more than 4% If the authorities intervene systematically over several quarters they get additional bang for their buck The impact is also greater in shallow financial markets These effects are not limited to the minutes or days after an intervention They show up even in quarterly data But the impact is not permanent either Intervention can narrow the kind of misalignments that occur over a one- to four-year spanit does not seem to influence longer-term swings in the currency Why does intervention work? One reason is that speculators are not as reliable as Friedman assumed The outfits that bet on currencies have a limited capacity to bear risk These limits tighten in times of stress when financial institutions pull in their horns reducing the size of bets In such circumstances national authorities may be better placed to correct misalignments even if they are no better at spotting themIntervention may also work by serving as a signal of policymakers’ resolve The government should after all know better than speculators what the government intends to do It may be determined to pursue policies consistent with a stronger currency But it may struggle to convince sceptical investors Through currency intervention it can put its foreign money where its mouth is Of the 18 central banks from emerging economies surveyed by the Bank of International Settlements in 2018 nearly three-quarters identified signalling as “often or sometimes important”The clock is tickingThese results offer little encouragement to Japan or Britain the two big economies suffering the steepest drop in their exchange rates this year The Bank of Japan is still committed to capping its government bond yields however high yields rise in other parts of the world That stance whatever its virtues is hardly consistent with a strong yen And given the size of Britain current-account deficit and the pace of its inflation the diminished pound is not obviously weaker than it should be Currency intervention can serve as a signal of tighter policies It cannot substitute for themTo support their currency Britain authorities must either raise interest rates rather faster than planned or reassert budgetary discipline Mr Kwarteng has said he will clarify his medium-term fiscal plans on November 23rd If he is to save the pound he may need to bring forward his fiscal clock Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:China rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy Sep 22ndRicher societies mean fewer babies Right?

 Sep 29th 2022,Japan monetary policymakers are sticking to their guns,There have been few months in monetary history as consequential as this September Countries everywhere have tightened the screws on borrowers to smother inflation But there has been a notable holdout The Bank of Japan boj the pioneer of modern zero-interest rate and bond-buying operations is standing firm Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe country has struggled with low inflation and even deflation for decades Its monetary policy has been designed to make financing conditions for companies and households as easy as possible in an effort to get them to spend In 2016 the boj adopted a policy of yield-curve control which caps 10-year government bond yields at around 0% This becomes more difficult when the rest of the world is raising interest rates since the growing spread leads to a weaker currency as investors seek stronger returns elsewhereOn September 22nd Kuroda Haruhiko the boj governor reiterated that the bank would hold rates down This statement familiar to BOJ-watchers was followed by something much rarer The value of the yen fell to its lowest in more than 20 years leading the Japanese government to intervene in currency markets for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in 1998The BOJ refusal to budge and the government intervention in currency markets reflect stark differences between Japan and the rest of the rich world In contrast to America and Europe Japan economy has still not returned to pre-pandemic output Japanese consumer prices rose by 28% year on year in August marginally above the BOJ 2% target But that figure may overstate the amount of underlying price pressure Excluding fresh food and energy costs prices were up just 16% year-on-year against an average of 72% across the oecd club of mostly rich countriesThe BOJ has another reason to sit on its hands Unlike most central banks which focus on very short-term interest rates Japan yield-curve control necessitates direct intervention in the market through buying and selling long-dated bonds It also relies on the widespread belief that the central bank will intervene to maintain the levels it is targeting which stops traders from buying or selling Japanese government bonds outside the tight band the BOJ sets Other central banks can simply retrace their steps and cut interest rates if required; once abandoned yield-curve control would be difficult to resume The fall in the currency makes imports more expensive in yen: the country import bill rose by 50% in August year on year Kishida Fumio the prime minister has announced support including a 50000 yen $350 handout for poor families Kataoka Goushi an economist until recently on the BOJ policy board reckons more co-ordination between monetary and fiscal policy will be needed to soften the impact of the weak yen and to reflate Japan economy That could take the form of household tax cuts now or business-investment incentives in the long runOutside Japan there may be unexpected consequences to the weak yen The country is the world largest foreign creditor Its net international investment positionoverseas assets held by Japanese owners minus Japanese assets held by overseas ownersruns to $35trn far north of China $19trn This huge pile is the result of decades of high savingsA weaker currency makes foreign assets worth more when measured in yen But the gyrating currency also means volatility making many owners nervous And the gap in interest rates between Japan and elsewhere makes hedging overseas investments exorbitantly expensive Perhaps as a result investors have sold 13trn yen in foreign securities so far this year according to the finance ministry the most since at least 2005 Thus the falling yen is not only an issue for Japan For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Financial markets are in chaos What next for the real economy?,The federal reserve began raising interest rates to battle inflation in America a full six months ago But its determination to crush surging prices whatever the cost to the economy is only now starting to sink in The central bank latest policy meeting which ended on September 21st has been followed by dramatic moves in financial markets across the world The economic consequences will be a little slower in coming but no weaker for it Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAfter the meeting Jerome Powell the Fed chairman said the central bank was “strongly resolved” to bring down inflation currently at 83% to its target of 2% That resolve sent government-bond yields surging and stockmarkets tumbling Yields on ten-year Treasuries rose by nearly half a percentage point On September 28th they spiked above 4% for the first time since just after the global financial crisis before falling a little Higher rates in America have turbocharged the dollar The dxy an index of the greenback against half a dozen major currencies has risen by nearly 18% this year and is now at its highest in more than two decades The flip side of dollar strength has been drama elsewhere In Britain sterling took a breathtaking dive aided by the government decision to unveil the country largest tax cuts since the 1970s Short-term interest rates rose just as spectacularly Meanwhile the euro reached its lowest point against the greenback in two decades on September 26th Expectations of rate rises by the European Central Bank as it fights the resulting increase in imported inflation sent bond yields in the euro area rising too In heavily indebted Italy yields on ten-year sovereign bonds are not far off a worrying 5% Jolting currency movements have led to a spate of interventions In Japan where the central bank is fighting an increasingly lonely battle to keep interest rates low the government intervened to prop up the yen for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in 1998; India central bank has also intervened to support the rupee China central bank is requiring banks to post reserves when selling foreign-exchange derivatives contracts making it harder to bet against the yuan The great unknown is the impact of these ructions on a financial system that has changed significantly since the crisis of 2007-09 Financiers and policymakers alike agree that banks are far safer But weird dysfunctions in less-scrutinised corners of the system cannot be ruled out One illustration of this came soon after Britain gilt markets were battered by the “mini-budget” Pension funds that had used derivatives to protect themselves against interest-rate risk found themselves pressed to raise cash to meet collateral requirements They raised that money by fire-selling long-dated gilts setting off a vicious cycle of sales and higher yields On September 28th the Bank of England stepped in saying it would purchase long-dated gilts to restore order Another worry stems from the roughly $24trn in private-market assets which have ballooned over the past decade So far this year these have been marked down by only 11% reckon analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank far less than the 20% or so decline in listed stocks and bonds Should markdowns catch up with the public markets the owners of these assets will take bigger losses It is unclear precisely who is on the hook The impact on the world economy by contrast is clearerand it is not good news Thanks to a natural-gas crisis in Europe and a housing slowdown in China its prospects were already looking dicey In forecasts published on September 26th the oecd a club of mostly rich countries said that global gdp would rise by just 3% this year down from the 45% it had expected in December Commodity prices a barometer of the state of the global economy have fallen in recent months The price of a barrel of Brent crude is now in the region of $83-88 levels not seen since Russia invaded Ukraine The prices of copper and other industrial metals are also downThe latest market volatility will add to the pain Rising government-bond yields are translating into higher borrowing costs for households and companies In America the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to 69% the highest since the financial crisis In Britain lenders briefly paused some new mortgage lending owing to volatile interest rates Yields on riskier high-yield or “junk” corporate bonds have more than doubled in America and the euro area to 94% and 78% respectivelyEurope seems set to suffer the most The energy crisis has already cast a long pall with economists pencilling in two to three quarters of negative gdp growth in the euro zone Annual inflation is already above 9% and a weaker euro will further push up the cost of imported goods The European Central Bank eager to shore up its inflation-fighting credibility has signalled that it intends to raise rates twice this year in order to keep inflation expectations in check Doing so will only deepen the recession on the continent As for America? The world largest economy has experienced an enviable boom in recent years buoyed by fiscal largesse during the covid-19 pandemic Rising rates are making a dent in the property market the most interest-sensitive part of the economy According to the latest Case-Shiller index published on September 27th house prices fell by 03% in July compared with the previous month the biggest such decline in a decadeFor now though there is little sign of a wider slowdown in America Underlying inflation at an annual rate of 63% is still considerably higher than the Fed would like In contrast to the housing market inflation tends takes a while to react to higher interest rates And until it comes down there will be no relief from rate rises Mr Powell has said he will be looking for “compelling evidence that inflation is moving down” The rest of the world will be watching just as anxiously For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 25th 2022,The world enters a new era: Bail-outs for everyone!,The winter of 1973-74 was grim and in similar ways to today In response to geopolitical strife energy prices went through the roof Across Europe the price of natural gas more than doubled and in places there were even bigger increases in heating oil The price of crude oil more than tripled This fed an inflationary surge across the rich world cutting real incomes There was no end in sightListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt the height of the crisis Willy Brandt West Germany chancellor summed up the official response in many countries “We’ll have to get dressed a little more warmly this winter” he said “and maybe the next two or three winters But we aren’t going to starve” His government like others focused on efforts to cut fuel consumptionby imposing speed limits telling people not to drive on Sundays and asking factories to turn down furnaces Sweden and the Netherlands introduced petrol rationing; Italy imposed a curfew in bars and restaurants Few governments doled out money In 1973 the real value of Britain benefits bill barely budged Today governments have introduced some measures to cut consumption But mainly they have turned on the fiscal taps Britain has allocated funding worth 65% of gdp in the next year to shield households and firms from higher energy bills more than it spent on its furlough scheme and support for the self-employed in 2020-21 Germany and France are offering handouts and subsidies worth about 3% of gdp European governments are nationalising chunks of their energy sectors America has spent too if on a smaller scale State governors are doling out “gas cards” and suspending fuel taxes to help people refill Imagine the reaction today if a country leader only followed Brandt approach and told people to put on an extra layerThe shift in energy policy hints at a more profound change in how governments govern Politicians have long sought to provide safety nets or stimulus in bad times But over the past 15 years they have become far more willing to shore up vast swathes of the economy When industries companies or people get into trouble fiscal help is never far away Gains are privatised but a growing share of losses or even potential losses are socialised To appreciate this role for the state discard much of the conventional wisdom which says that in the “neoliberal” era governments have let free markets run riot Instead this is an era of “bail-outs for everyone”Three events have shaped the new era First is the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In this period America spent 35% of gdp on crisis-related bail-outs including capital infusions for banks and mortgage lenders according to Deborah Lucas of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The justification for the interventions was that doing nothing would have proved far costlier If the banking system had collapsed so would the rest of the economy When covid-19 arrived bail-outs moved from the financial economy to the real one “Everybody said we bailed out the banks and we didn’t look after the people who really suffered” said Boris Johnson then Britain prime minister This time would be different During lockdowns governments handed out trillions of dollars of support guaranteed vast amounts of corporate lending and banned evictions and bankruptcies Unlike in previous crises rates of poverty hunger and destitution did not rise and in some places fell Across the rich world disposable incomes rose The third event is the surge in energy prices that has followed Russia war in Ukraine The challenge facing Europe where the consumer price of energy has already risen by 45% since last year has convinced many politicians that once again there is no option but massive state intervention Europe energy bills will rise by about €2trn relative to 2021 according to analysis by Goldman Sachs a bank Thanks to hastily patched together measures governments will subsidise much of this The cumulative effect of three once-in-a-generation crises in quick succession has been a change in the terms of political debate Politicians have set new expectations of what the state can and should do This is visible in the smaller bail-outs guarantees and rescues that have mushroomed since the start of the 2010s The Italian government for instance has set up schemes to deal with banks’ non-performing loans in an attempt to get the private financial sector to lend again The British government has offered banks vast guarantees to get them to offer bigger mortgages The value of bank deposits insured by America government has risen by 40% in the past five yearsRecently things have gone into overdrive In August President Joe Biden announced that he would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out Americans holding student-loan debt Around the same time he expanded loan guarantees for clean energy Australia and New Zealand have offered citizens cost-of-living payments to deal with high inflation Poland has introduced a moratorium on mortgage debt It is only a matter of time before the next intervention comes along What if Intel a tech firm crucial to Mr Biden domestic semiconductor drive begins to struggle? What if in a year time Europe energy prices remain sky-high? The true size of the bail-out state is hard to calculate in part by design Governments generally do not include so-called “contingent liabilities” such as guaranteed loans and implicit backstops in fiscal figures This allows them to support the economy while keeping reported debt down Conventional measures of America public debt do not for instance include the promises and obligations that the state has made to groups ranging from the financial industry to airports to pensioners The truth starts to become clearer if you dig into government balance-sheets It turns out for instance that British ministers have promised to help a bewildering number of projects The British state is responsible for clearing up the Channel Tunnel if it falls into disuse It has made commitments to support pension liabilities of some individual pension schemes if deficits need to be funded It may cover reinsurers of commercial and industrial property in the event of a big terrorist attack Adapting work by James Hamilton at the University of California San Diego we have attempted to calculate the total implicit liabilities of the American federal governmentin effect how much it has promised to pay if things go wrong plus commitments for which it has not fully accounted In addition to reported public debt we add off-balance-sheet obligations including guarantees on people bank deposits health-care payouts and mortgage guarantees for the first time ever the federal government recently became the guarantor or source of funding for more than half of American mortgages We find that the state is on the hook for liabilities worth more than six times the country gdp and that these liabilities have in recent years grown much faster than the country output see chart 1 Other data also point to a growing bail-out state Rich-world government spending on subsidies and transfers such as welfare benefits has grown inexorably as politicians help companies that are struggling and compensate households who they deem to have had a raw deal see chart 2 In Britain this spending has not been so high since the data began in 1948 America is known as a place with a meagre welfare statea perception that no longer fits reality In 1979 the bottom fifth of American earners received means-tested transfers worth 32% of their pre-tax income according to the Congressional Budget Office By 2018 the figure was 68% Governments are quicker to respond to emergencies too Evidence from Deutsche Bank shows that the size of financial-sector bail-outs has grown We examined public-spending data from Britain looking at whether actual spending by government departments came in higher or lower than originally budgeted This gives a sense of how frequently and how decisively the government responds to emergencies Mid-year bail-outs used to be rarethey no longer are see chart 3 A recent paper by Dan Gabriel Anghel of the Bucharest University of Economic Studies and colleagues shows that governments’ contingent liabilities are crystallising into actual payouts more often than used to the case In the 1990s European governments launched about two rescue operations a year In 2019 they launched ten No one likes to see a business go bust or someone fall into destitution The fact that this happens less frequently is on its own terms welcome Another benefit of the bail-out state is that people and businesses no longer need to spend quite as much on insurance since they know the state will step in In America total spending on insurance premiums peaked in the early 2000s at around 8% of gdp but has now fallen to under 6% This represents an enormous savingThere are downsides however aside from the potentially monumental fiscal costs As Friedrich Hayek an economist pointed out while a given interventiona bank bail-out saymay be justifiable in its own right lots of interventions together may strangle an economy Capitalism produces innovations and higher incomes through the process of creative destruction Things that do not work stop and things that work better start An economywide safety-net slows this down For now governments are unlikely to change course So long as they are not directed at banks bail-outs tend to be popular And with the possible exception of Britain investors seem not as yet to have fully digested the fiscal risks implicit in this new strategy When the next recession hits as it may well soon expect another round of furlough schemes additional benefits and stimulus cheques When the next industry fails expect a big rescue package We are all bankers now For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 22nd 2022,Why Wall Street is snapping up family homes,Housing is the world biggest asset class But until recently renting out family homes was a mom-and-pop cottage business seen as uninvestable by Wall Street When Blackstone a private-equity giant floated the idea of creating vast portfolios of homes after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 banks refused to lend to it The firm ran the idea by Sam Zell a property mogul who sold Blackstone his $39bn office empire before the financial crisis “No way” he retorted For an investor routinely splurging on hotel chains and swanky office towers the buy-to-let business seemed like small fry by comparison Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBlackstone went ahead despite Mr Zell advice A decade on from the first purchase in Phoenix Arizonaan outlay worth $100000the experiment has morphed into an institutional-grade asset class Last year interest in the sector reached fever pitch According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting a research firm big investors committed at least $45bn to buying single-family homes in America up from $3bn the year before Even as housing markets cool investment is pouring in with firms including Goldman Sachs and kkr following in Blackstone footstepsIt is easy to see why Between 2016 and 2021 annual returns from family rentals of 21% have outperformed those of housing for old folk 7% offices 5% shopping malls -1% and even apartments 12% according to Green Street another research firm Unlike mom-and-pop investors who tend to own no more than a handful of homes the biggest institutions hold tens of thousands which are offered renovated and have around-the-clock maintenance Invitation Homes America largest family landlord says it spends an average of $39000 fixing up each one kitting them out with new flooring upgraded plumbing and the latest tech such as video doorbells and smart locksThese goodies are attracting richer tenants Between 2010 and 2018 those with incomes of above $75000 accounted for three-quarters of the growth in renters Covid-19 accelerated this as bidding wars forced high-earners to rent Invitation Homes says its residents now have an annual household income of above $131000 nearly twice the country medianThere is plenty of room for further expansion In America real-estate investment trusts reits own just 1% of single-family rentals compared with 5-10% of offices and warehouses 15% of housing for old people and 50% of shopping malls Big investors are also starting to build more rather than just buying up existing stock Last year they built a record 7705 family units up from an average of 5500 in 2015-20 By 2030 MetLife Investment Management an asset manager expects institutions to have amassed 76m homes more than two-fifths of all family rentalsThe trend has also spread to Europe Investors such as Aviva and Legal & General are building thousands of rental homes across Britain which now has more than 73000 “build to rent” properties Institutional investors are also gobbling up property in Germany Ireland the Netherlands and the Nordic markets which have higher shares of renters than other rich countriesWhat behind the explosive growth? One explanation is that ageing millennials offer a growing market As they approach their late 30s and early 40sa sweet spot for landlordsmany want better schools for their children or space for pets or finally have enough money to dump their housemates In America population growth in this age category will nearly double over the next five years Ageing baby-boomers are also renting in higher numbers In England the proportion of those aged 55 to 64 who are renting has almost doubled since 2011Declining housing affordability helps Those unable to buy homes have little choice but to rent meaning landlords are confident of their ability to find and keep new tenants especially for entry-level homes In America at least 420000 starter homes were built each year in the 1970s Last year just 93000 were Thus rents continue to climb Across the country those for family homes rose by more than 13% in June compared with a year earlier In Orlando they were up by 23% In Miami by more than a third Despite rising rents Wall Street landlords are not immune to economic uncertainty Inflation means the cost of renovating and maintaining homes is rising Invitation Homes says the amount it spent on these things rose by nearly 8% in the second quarter of this year Construction costs have also risen posing risk for investors building from scratch Prices for building materials including concrete lumber and steel have surged by 38% since the start of 2020 Interest-rate rises are another worry; as the market softens investors are taking a more cautious approach Home Partners of America owned by Blackstone announced in August that it would pause home purchases in 38 cities markets that represent 5% of its activity Economic cycles are inevitable Rents are unlikely to continue to climb at a record pace Yet history suggests that residential rents are more resilient than those from other property types especially in periods when supply is tight From 1974 to 1985 another period of high inflation rents actually increased by 7-12% a year notes Jay Parsons an economist at RealPage a data firm Even as homebuyer demand crashed during the global financial crisis demand from residential tenants did not waver Although the housing splurge of institutional investors may calm a bit it is unlikely to cease Correction September 30th 2022: An earlier version of this article said that the value of American family rental homes owned by institutional investors is $47trn In fact that is the value of all the country family rental homes Sorry 
 Sep 22nd 2022,Peter Thiel says California suffers from a “tech curse” Is he right?,Speaking recently at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami Peter Thiel an investor and intellectual made a provocative argument He suggested that California suffers from a “tech curse”: a play on the “resource curse” the notion that countries with abundant natural resources often have weak economies and corrupt political systems If data is the new oil then California is the new Saudi Arabiaeven he said if things aren’t quite “as bad as Equatorial Guinea” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Thiel made the Equatorial Guinea comparison with tongue firmly in cheek but he was deadly serious about the tech-curse theory At first glance it seems plausible California tech industry has in recent years produced astonishing wealth The state is also in many ways dysfunctional Parts of downtown San Francisco resemble an open-air drug den Many of the state public schools seem keener on talking about social justice than teaching children Each year one in every 100 Californians on net leaves for another state Mr Thiel thinks that California poverty and prosperity are two sides of the same coin with state and local governments providing the link Public-sector employees draw on tech enormous tax revenues to overpay themselves and do no work he says The state tech moguls in effect buy off politicians ensuring for example that they enact super-restrictive planning regulations to keep house prices high It is in vogue to criticise both California and tech: doing both at the same time left the audience in raptures There is also a grain of truth to what Mr Thiel says But there are two big problems with his theory Take the benefits offered by California tech industry first Tech has in fact turned the state into a growth superstar not a laggard In the past five years California state-level gdp has grown by 18% the fourth-fastest rate in the country and a better performance than either Florida or Texas see chart Even subtracting tech California growth was above average according to our calculations Less fashionable industries such as chemicals manufacturing have also done well in recent years Many of the proceeds of this growth have gone on enormous mansions in Atherton and Los Altos but they have also trickled down to a greater extent than Mr Thiel appreciates Just over a decade ago the median Californian household had an income 7% higher than the median American one Now their income is 15% higher The unemployment rate relative to the national average has fallen So has poverty And there is little to suggest that the decline in joblessness or poverty is caused by poor people leaving the stateMr Thiel also overstates tech costs It is true that some of California politicians behave with nearly as much impunity as the Saudi elite Yet anyone with a passing knowledge of Californian history knows that dirty dealing in politics long predates tech San Francisco politics today is tame in comparison with the 1970s It is similarly hard to blame tech for California housing market The ratio of California average house price to America is much lower than in the mid-2000s Meanwhile California anti-building rules the cause of sky-high prices emerged with the environmentalist movement of the 1970s not Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk There is a lot to dislike about Big Tech but it is not as malign as Mr Thiel believes For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The obvious explanation is a once-in-a-generation surge in inflation Across the oecd club of mostly rich countries prices are rising by about 10% a year Economists dislike inflation; the general public despises it Many people think that price-gouging firms are taking them for fools Yet high inflation is not a sufficient explanation for the gloominess Our analysis finds that American consumer sentiment is about a third lower than you would expect given the rate of inflation Behavioural economics offers three other potential explanations The first is to do with expectations In 2020 many pundits speculated that once covid-19 was beaten the world would enter the “roaring twenties” So far that hasn’t happened Productivity growth remains low; no one owns a flying car How could you not be disappointed? The second relates to the comedown from the stimulus bonanza In 2020-21 rich-world governments doled out trillions of dollars to households boosting disposable incomes by an unusually large amount This year governments have largely stopped the handouts Average disposable incomes are now falling even without accounting for inflation Nobody likes that The third relates to the stimulus bonanza itself A new working paper by Ania Jaroszewicz of Harvard University and colleagues finds tentative evidence that people who get modest cash payments of up to $2000the sort of amounts given out during the pandemicactually become unhappier These payments are not big enough to be life-changing and may simply highlight what recipients are unable to afford The fiscal response to covid it seems has a sting in its tail All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 22nd 2022,How to rebrand stockmarket indices,Good morning and thank you for the invitation to Hieroglyph Capital Partners You asked us to demonstrate our marketing skills by choosing an aspect of your branding to review Now this may be eccentric but we’ve picked your tracker funds Hieroglyph green-investment programme its philanthropic work or its industry-leading quantitative analysts are all more obvious candidates for our attention Tracker funds are dull and deliberately so: they’re just algorithms that let your investors replicate the performance of stockmarket indices as cheaply as possible Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKExcept for the choice of index any one is just like all the others But a nondescript product doesn’t preclude a strong brandit demands one Think of airlines Or perfume Or lager More importantly the boring reasons for preferring passive funds to actively managed ones are getting harder to sell Investors are happy to buy a low-cost fund that indiscriminately tracks the market return when everything is heading in the right direction But even if they know that virtually no active manager beats the market over the long-term it gets harder to remember this when they’re losing money This year a lot of them have lost a lot They’re starting to wonder if a good stockpicker could have sheltered them from the worst of itConvince investors to associate a fund with a compelling brand rather than just its fact sheet and Key Investor Document and you stand a better chance of retaining them A successful brand has three components It is distinct from its peers and it is relevant to your clients and their investment goals Crucially it also has “proof points” or evidence that it delivers on its promises Which brings us to our three case studies: Hieroglyph s&p 500 fund tracking the index of large American stocks; the Nikkei 225 fund tracking Japanese firms; and the ftse 100 fund tracking the largest hundred companies listed in LondonThe s&p 500 fund already stands out Investors know that it is weighted heavily towards tech firms and that in Apple Amazon and Alphabet it contains the biggest corporate victors of the past few decades That lets them think of it as both a safe playbetting on established winnersand as a punt on the future But its relevance and proof points are looking shaky Investors like the idea of risk-taking innovative firms but only when their share prices are going up So far this year the s&p 500 is down 20% That not in line with anyone investment goalsThe key is to play down the exciting tech-driven disruptive side of the s&p 500 Call it the “All American Fund” instead The index captures four-fifths of America stockmarket value after all That makes it a proxy for the world biggest economy one which is well-placed to weather a recession Investors will be looking for reassurance if the market keeps falling Give it to themThere is another fund that would benefit from a similar approach Investors still associate Japanese stocks with deflation weak corporate governance and the bubble of the 1980s But today inflation of just 3% makes Japan a safer bet than most economies A weak yen ought to be good for its exporters too You could do worse than dusting off your Nikkei 225 fund and naming it the “Safe Haven Fund” The ftse 100 fund is a thornier problem Again it stands out The absence of tech firms and preponderance of “old economy” stocksenergy mining and banksis firmly lodged in investors’ minds At the start of this year this seemed like a good thing Tech looked frothy; soaring commodity prices and rising interest rates were going to help the dinosaurs roar If Britain economy and currency were shaky no matter: most of the ftse earnings come from countries outside BritainIt hasn’t worked out Measured in dollars the ftse 100 has fallen by 20% this year To have dropped by the same as the s&p 500 after a decade of radically underperforming it makes investors question whether London flagship index is good for anything at all One answer is supposed to be its dividend yield but at 37% that barely any better than Treasuries these daysRather than rebranding we’d advise taking this fund out of the spotlight A brand can’t deliver unless the product can As for relevance the value of the entire index is less than that of Apple Stop marketing it to your clients and you send them a message about Hieroglyph own brand: that you don’t try to sell investors things they don’t needRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why investors should forget about delayed gratification Sep 15thEmerging-market stocks are struggling in an intangible world Sep 8thWhy investors are reaching for the astrology of finance Sep 1stFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 21st 2022,A global manufacturing slowdown suggests worse is to come,“Is a global recession imminent?” asks a new report by the World Bank The answerthat one very well might bewill not be a surprise to manufacturers In August global manufacturing output shrank relative to the month before and new orders fell for the second month in a row according to JPMorgan Chase a bank As economic woes mount worse could be ahead for factories and the broader economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLast year industry enjoyed an epic boom Consumers bolstered by generous covid-19 relief splashed out on goods and the easing of lockdowns allowed factories to make up lost ground The value of global manufacturing output leapt to more than $16trn representing the highest share of gdp in nearly two decades Roaring industry powered a banner year for the world economy with overall global output rising by 61% the fastest pace on record despite supply-chain problems A softening of demand was inevitable as life became normal and spending shifted back from goods to services But even service-sector activity looks disappointing of late and manufacturing troubles reflect much bigger shocks The most serious is the energy-price crunch caused by Russia war in Ukraine Industrial production in the euro zone fell by 24% in July against the year before Firms have had to idle plants in the face of energy costs which render production uneconomicala cold winter would bring even more pain The beleaguered Chinese economy is also a problem Manufacturers struggling with “zero-covid” policies and a property-market bust were hit by an additional shock over the summer as intense drought impeded shipping and dealt a blow to hydropower Data from Caixin a business publication show that Chinese manufacturing sales shrank in August compared with the previous month The performance of economies which typically export lots of goods and components to China also spells trouble South Korean production swooned over the summer for instance as its exports to China tumbled The drag from high energy costs and a limping Chinese economy has been reinforced by tightening monetary policy Surging demand for goods over the past two years overtaxed the capacity of factories ships and ports pushing inflation up High prices have proven remarkably persistentthanks in part to the shock of the war in Ukraineso central banks are taking aggressive action Such synchronous tightening has occurred rarely over the past half century notes the World Bank and resembles the positioning which triggered a global recession in 1982 For now manufacturers in India and South-East Asia have resisted global headwinds That may reflect efforts to diversify supply chains away from China During the first seven months of 2022 China exports of goods to America were up by 18% compared with the year before Exports from India were up by 30% however while those from Vietnam were up by 33% Indonesia by 41% and Bangladesh by 50% Yet their fortunes are ultimately roped to the world economy as a whole; if it continues to weaken even relatively insulated places will find it difficult to avoid a slump A global recession is not a foregone conclusion Manufacturing suffered in 2015-16 and in 2019 and in both cases the economy avoided a downturn But in these periods policy changed dramatically to prevent weakening growth from snowballing In the middle of the decade the Federal Reserve raised rates far more slowly than it had led markets to expectand China opened a fire hose of stimulus In 2019 the Fed pivoted to rate cuts even as President Donald Trump tax plan swelled American deficits boosting the world economy There is little immediate hope for similar reversals China is wedded to its zero-covid policies for now meaning new stimulus would do little to boost growth Recently Fed officials have told markets they should expect American interest rates to rise higher and stay there for longereven if this pushes the economy towards recession see next story Indeed so long as American consumer spending remains robust the Fed will probably feel that its inflation-fighting work is unfinished The safe bet is that conditions will get worse before they get better But how much worse? The World Bank presents three scenarios for next year The baseline is one consistent with the current consensus outlook for growth of about 15% per person but which is probably not consistent with central banks’ desired fall in inflationand which is thus almost certainly too optimistic In a second “sharp downturn” scenario central banks have to work harder to arrest inflation but still fail to restore price stability and growth decelerates to 08% per person The third is one in which significant synchronous monetary tightening induces a recession such that global output shrinks by about 04% per person Either of the latter scenarios would be bitter for countries still recovering from the covid downturn Debt loads around the world remain alarmingly high and many countries’ economies lag below their pre-pandemic trendline Their leaders will be watching the slowdown in global manufacturing with considerable trepidation For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 20th 2022,China rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy,In 2011 the American Economic Review published an influential article entitled “Growing like China” Its authors including Zheng Song of the Chinese University of Hong Kong tried to explain the country distinctive pace and pattern of development The title was as well received as the argument echoed in a variety of papers such as “Innovating like China” “Investing like China” and “Internationalising like China”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis year however the country is not growing like China at all Thanks to its deep property slump and the government “zero-covid” policy which entails lockdowns in response to every outbreak of the virus the economy is now forecast to grow by less than 3% in 2022 according to banks such as Nomura Morgan Stanley and ubs That is far below the official target of 55% China currency is also weakening On September 16th it took more than seven yuan to buy a dollar for the first time since July 2020 A gap has opened up between the gdp path envisaged for China at the start of this year and the grimmer one that now seems probable China gdp in 2023 could be more than $2trn below the level forecast in January reckons Goldman Sachs another bankIt is not like China to settle for such underperformance In the past economists have marvelled at its ability to stimulate spending when necessary so as to meet its growth targets and adequately employ its busy workforce and workshops Even after the global financial crisis in 2008 China gdp quickly caught up to where it would have been had the crisis never happened Impressed by this result Yi Wen of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis and Jing Wu of Tsinghua University wrote another “like China” paper entitled “Withstanding the Great Recession like China”The country resilience the authors argued rested on the unconventional bust-busting tools that it had at its disposal China like other countries eased monetary policy when the global financial crisis struck But in other countries companies and consumers remained reluctant to borrow even at rock-bottom interest rates As a result monetary easing did not translate into a big expansion of credit In China by contrast state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects borrowed eagerly from China banks at the government behest Other countries pushed on a string China had other strings to pull Why then is China not withstanding this year slowdown as it did in the past? Its fiscal deficit broadly defined to include off-budget borrowing will increase this year But only by about 3% of gdp according to Goldman Sachs The fiscal swing was more like 4% of gdp in the two years from 2008 to 2010 And it was even larger in response to China property slowdown in 2015 Tax breaks for firms account for a big share of this year stimulus compared with the negligible role they played in 2008-09 That could be more efficient if companies know better than the government how to spend the money But it may be less effective if firms choose not to spend it at allLocal governments and their financing vehicles which led the stimulus efforts in 2008 are not now so bold The property slump has hurt land sales which accounted for about a third of their revenues last year And the signs of financial strain are not confined to the ledger books To plug budgetary holes 80 out of 111 cities tracked by Southern Weekly a mainland newspaper increased the amount they collected in fines last year Yulin a city in Shaanxi province imposed a fine of 66000 yuan $9500 on a grocer for selling 25kg of subpar celery An indebted state-owned bus company in Lanzhou the capital of Gansu province floated an ingenious idea to pay the overdue salaries of some of its staff Unable to apply for additional loans itself it suggested the employees themselves take out loans which the company pledged to repayThe lack of avid borrowers is blunting China monetary policy much as it did in other big economies after the global financial crisis China has cut a variety of interest rates including its first reduction in the benchmark deposit rate since 2015 Yet faster growth in the money supply has not so far translated into an equivalent acceleration of credit In principle the central government could do more itself to revive growth It could increase spending or help bridge the financial gaps suffered by lower levels of government It has allowed local authorities to issue another 500bn yuan of “special bonds” which are supposed to be repaid with revenues from the infrastructure projects they finance But that is both less than many analysts expected and less than requiredChina leaders may be seeking to avoid the past mistakes even if it means also forgoing the past successes Xi Jinping China president and Li Keqiang its prime minister came into office in 2013 several years after the financial crash when the unwelcome after-effects of China stimulus efforts were keenly felt Torrential spending by the many arms of the state left behind excess capacity a skewed pattern of production and heavy debts Mr Li has repeatedly promised not to resort to “flood-like” stimulus a veiled reference to the past From hero to zeroThere is a simpler explanation for the change of approach too Mr Xi has become deeply invested in maintaining a “zero-covid” regime which he portrays as proof of China superior social model Local governments are under pressure to keep a lid on infections; a preoccupation that would distract them from an all-out effort to boost public investment even if the financing were available In addition the ever-present threat of lockdowns has crushed the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs Thus any additional government outlays would be less effective in stimulating private spending Other countries may outpace the country economy this year But no one fights covid-19 like China Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Richer societies mean fewer babies Right?

 Sep 15th 2022,Against expectations covid-19 retirees are returning to work,On september 11th Tom Brady marked his “unretirement” from America National Football League guiding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a decisive win over the Dallas Cowboys in their first game of the season Mr Brady probably the greatest quarterback in history had earlier this year announced that he was retiring only to change his mind a few weeks later The 45-year-old athlete is it seems not the only one who cannot bring himself to give up the grind Across the rich world old folk are flocking back to workListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is quite a turnaround When the covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020 many people already close to retirement brought the date forward Using data from a variety of sources we estimate that the rich world labour-force participation rate for people aged 65 and over crashed that spring see chart This represented a relatively larger decline than for people of working age Like everybody else some oldies were fired as demand dried up In addition though they also faced higher risks of becoming seriously ill or dying if they caught covid meaning many no longer wanted to work Economists had assumed based on historical experience that pandemic retirees would never come back Employers often unfairly turn their noses up at older job applicants; for their part older folk can find the idea of learning the ropes at a new place daunting Indeed two years on many appear to have followed the example of Rob Gronkowski Mr Brady former partner in crime hanging up their cleats for good But a surprising number have followed the path of Mr Brady There are probably more over-65s in the rich world labour force today than there were in 2019 Old-age participation is lower than it would have been without the pandemic But we estimate that the number of pandemic-induced retirees has fallen by 20-40% from its peak In Britain and South Korea old-age activity is higher today than it was in 2019 Other data back up the idea of a wave of unretirements Statistics from Europe suggest that as early as the end of 2020 an unusually large share of people aged 55 to 74 were moving from economic inactivity to employment According to our analysis of official microdata in the second quarter of this year some 75000 Britons in paid work said that they had been retired the year before much higher than the pre-pandemic norm It is a similar story in America Nick Bunker of Indeed a jobs site finds that the share of retired workers returning to the workplace each month is higher than it was before the pandemicIn some cases retirees have little choice but to return Market turmoil has reduced the value of pension pots in America the total value of retirement assets fell by 45% in the first quarter Some retirees have run down “excess” savings that they had accumulated during the covid lockdowns And inflation now approximately 10% year on year across the rich world is cutting the purchasing power of fixed payments that those in their dotage are receiving Yet there are pull factors too The threat of the virus has dissipated meaning more people are comfortable with being in public spaces Thanks to red-hot demand for workers employers have had little choice but to set aside their prejudice and some erstwhile retirees are able to earn pretty well even if only working part-time Others though may simply have realised in Mr Brady words that their “place is still on the field and not in the stands” All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 15th 2022,Richer societies mean fewer babies Right?,In a speech to the Vatican in January Pope Francis made an observation fit for an economist He argued that declining fertility rates might lead to a “demographic winter” In every European country the total fertility rate the expected number of children a woman will have in her lifetime has now fallen below 21 the level needed to maintain a stable population without immigration The same is true in many developing countries including China and as of this year India This the pope warned would weigh on the world economic healthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEconomists have long considered such a slowdown inevitable In the best-known model of fertility popularised by Gary Becker a Nobel-prizewinning economist and others in the 1960s there is a central role for the trade-off between the “quantity and quality” of children As countries grow richer and the returns to education rise it is expected that families will invest more in a smaller number of children And as women working options expand the opportunity cost of their time will grow making the trade-off between family and career more difficult Fitting this theory many places have already gone through a “demographic transition” in which poor high-fertility countries become rich low-fertility ones In some the transition has been so dramatic that their populations have started to decline The number of people in Japan has fallen by about 3m since peaking at 128m in 2008 Many demographers suspect China population is also falling no matter what the country official figures claim Yet an emerging body of research suggests that fertility may go through another shift at a later stage of development A recent review of the literature by Matthias Doepke of Northwestern University and co-authors makes the case that in rich countries fertility may rise or at least fall at a slower rate if norms policies and the market for child care make it easier for a woman to have children and a career In countries with say supportive family policy or fathers who take on a greater share of child-care duties one would expect working women to have more children than in the pastOne way to see if this is true is to compare fertility rates across countries with differing incomes and female labour-force participation In 1980 countries in the oecd with higher female participation rates had lower rates of fertility By 2000 that relationship had flipped: countries with higher rates of female labour-force participation had higher rates of fertility Since then the picture has muddied slightly By 2019 the new relationship had weakened a little and it looks less sturdy when considering gdp per person rather than labour-force participationBut when looked at within countries the new pattern of fertility becomes clearer A paper published in 2018 by Michael Bar of San Francisco State University and co-authors shows that in America the relationship between education and fertility which used to be a downward-sloping trend has turned into something of a reversed-tick mark Women with advanced degrees have slightly more children than college graduates A similar pattern holds when looking at income The authors argue that the growing availability of child care has reduced the difficulty of the trade-off between family and workGovernments are also trying to change the picture Last year South Korea fertility rate dropped to 081 a record low In 2019 family-leave policy changed to allow parents with young children to take an additional year of reduced hours on top of an already generous year off work The share of South Korean parents who take leave has doubled in the past decade from 12% to 24% Meanwhile Hungary has exempted mothers of four or more children from income taxes for lifea more controversial approach especially since Viktor Orban the country prime minister has justified it as a way to boost the population without allowing immigration to rise A report published by the un last year found that the share of countries with pro-natalist policies had grown from 20% in 2005 to 28% in 2019Not all interventions are equally effective Work by Janna Bergsvik of Statistics Norway an official research outfit and colleagues finds that although some measures including subsidised child care make a difference others including parental leave accomplish far less Mr Doepke says the biggest boost to fertility occurs when interventions match the way that societies operate The provision of child care will make little difference if social norms push women to stay at home to look after children But in Denmark where fathers take on more child-care responsibilities than in other rich countries the provision of state-subsidised care for children made a big difference The country fertility rate rose from 138 in 1983 to 172 in 2021 Flush of youthThere is a lot riding on the new fertility switch lasting The share of the population in the oecd aged 65 and over is expected to have passed 50% by 2050 about 20 points higher than today As rich countries grow old there will be greater demand for carers which will make it more expensive to hire child care Without a productivity revolution perhaps featuring robot nannies child care will remain a privilege of the rich in places without state-funded provision It is also unclear if norms that make the family-career trade-off easier will continue to spread Yet the worse the problem becomes the harder governments will work to combat it And as they experiment evidence will build about which responses are the most effective The covid-19 pandemic may also end up helping It delayed many families’ decisions about whether to have children but in time it may turn out to have had a more positive impact The rise of working-from-home should make working with children easier In his speech the pope lamented those people who chose to look after pets instead of children Maybe that trade-off will lessen too Read more

 Sep 15th 2022,Why investors should forget about delayed gratification,The marshmallow test is a classic of standardised psychology A young child is given a marshmallow and told they can eat it whenever they like Wait for 15 minutes though and they can have two Then they are left alone When the test was first performed at Stanford University in the 1960s the average child succumbed in three minutes But those who did not were rewarded with more than just a sugar rush A follow-up study in 1990 showed that success on the test was associated with a whole range of goodies in later life from academic achievement to coping better with stressListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBy now the associated investment lesson is eye-rollingly familiar Jam tomorrow should be prized over jam today Valuing a firm by its present earnings assets and dividend yield is for the dinosaurs The pace of technological innovation has made these metrics obsolete; instead what matters is a company chance of explosive future growth For the canonical example look to Amazon: unprofitable for decades now the world fifth-largest company To their proponents the beating growth stocks have taken over the past year simply does not matter Truly innovative disruptive firms will eventually provide returns that make any number of temporary setbacks eminently bearableSuch thinking has guided some of the most successful investors of the past few decades Yet their strategies have played out during a 40-year period in which interest rates have mostly fallen Should that trend now reverseand the Federal Reserve seems set to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for its third meeting in a row on September 21st the logic will be turned on its head In a world of higher interest rates waiting for jam tomorrow just isn’t worth itTo see why first consider a crucial driver of this year downturn In place of current profits growth stocks offer the prospect of bigger ones in the future But a dollar in ten years’ time is not worth the same as a dollar today because the dollar today can earn income in the meantime At an interest rate of 1% you need to deposit $91 to have $100 in ten years’ time At a rate of 5% you can deposit just $61 Hence this year fall in growth stocks: as rates have risen the promise of future profits has become worth considerably less in the presentThis logic has broader implications than most investors realise Now imagine you will receive $100 a year for ever By the reasoning above this has a finite present value since compound interest means payments in the distant future are almost worthless With interest rates at 1% the payment stream is worth $10000; at 5% it is worth $2000 But as well as reducing the value the higher rate also changes the distribution of that value With rates at 1% less than a tenth of the stream value comes from payments made in the first ten years At 5% around two-fifths doesIn other words higher interest rates dramatically alter firms’ incentives when choosing which timeline to invest over Sacrificing short-term profits for longer-term gains is one thing when you are trying to persuade investors that your superapp machine-learning algorithm or gene-sequencing widget has the potential to up-end an industry It is another when even the best-case scenario has its value so heavily skewed towards what can be done in the next decade Startup founders are used to shaking off derision over implausible Utopian dreams It is more of a kick in the teeth to realise that even Utopia is not worth much unless it can be achieved in short orderNor are the implications limited to early-stage firms or even to the stockmarket Should profits be reinvested in a project that may not make returns quickly enough to be worthwhile or should they just be returned to shareholders as a dividend? Should a company with callable bonds and cash to spare bother repaying?

 Sep 13th 2022,America still has an inflation problem,Editor note September 14th 2022: This story has been updated to include markets’ reactionIt had been hoped that America latest inflation report would bring good news Headline annual inflation has been falling from the peak of 91% in June and economists expected August would bring a second month of modest increasesby recent standardsin core prices which exclude food and energy Those hopes were dashed The release on September 13th showed another drop in the headline annual rate to 83% But core prices rose 06% twice the 03% forecast The news hit markets: the s&p 500 index dropped by 44% as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates harder and faster to cool the economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInvestors are focused on core inflation because of big swings in energy prices The price of crude oil is down a quarter from its peak in early June In a breakdown of the August price data energy lowered the month-on-month inflation rate by nearly half a percentage point Other componentsfood goods and services such as rentpushed up prices see chartWere August rate of core inflation sustained for a full year it would mean a 74% annual rate which is well above the Federal Reserve target of 2% Investors believe the Fed will opt for its third consecutive three-quarter-point interest-rate increase when it meets later this month making for the most aggressive pace of tightening in four decades It may go further and raise rates by a full percentage pointOne critical factor in the persistence of high inflation is labour-market tightness With roughly two jobs available per unemployed person workers have strong bargaining power which leads to hefty wage gains A tracker from the Fed Atlanta branch shows that in August wages rose at an annualised pace of nearly 7% The grim conclusion for many economists is that America may require a marked increase in unemployment in order to temper wage pressures and ultimately inflationThe median projection of the Fed rate-setting committee is that the unemployment rate will only need to tick up slightly to 41% in 2024 from the current level of 37% But a recent paper by Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins University and Daniel Leigh and Prachi Mishra of the imf argues that a 41% level of unemployment would be consistent with core inflation of between 27% and 88% in 2024 In other words only in the rosiest scenarios does it seem America can escape the inflationary mire without lots of job lossesNevertheless the divergence between core and headline inflation poses an intriguing question As far as consumers are concerned there is no such distinction All prices matter and indeed prices at the petrol pump do more to capture the attention of Americans than prices anywhere else Surveys of consumers show that their expectations for future inflation have come down sharply since June undoubtedly thanks to the decline in oil pricesAs Mr Ball and his co-authors argue a failure to account for the pass-through from energy prices into core inflation was one reason why economists were wrong-footed by inflationary pressure over the past year The hope now is that the plunge in energy prices can continue and that the pass-through into weaker core inflation will again wrong-foot many economists For now however America inflation problem shows little sign of going away For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 12th 2022,China Ponzi-like property market is eroding faith in the government,The 120km train ride between the cities of Luoyang and Zhengzhou is a showcase of economic malaise and broken dreams From the window endless half-built residential towers pass one after another for the duration of the hour-long journey Many of the buildings are near completion; some are finished and have become homes But many more are skeletons where construction ceased long ago Developers have run out of cash and can no longer pay workers Projects have stalled Families will never get their homesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe train ride through China heartland helps to explain one of the country biggest crises in recent memory: the public loss of confidence in the government economic model For decades the property industry has been symbolic of China rise Private entrepreneurs have made vast fortunes Average people have witnessed their net worth soar as home values trebled Local governments have filled their coffers by selling vast tracts of land to developers An astonishing 70% of Chinese household wealth is now tied up in real estate To undermine trust in this model is to shake the foundations of China growth miracle With sweeping covid-19 lockdowns and a crackdown on private entrepreneurs this is happening on many fronts But nowhere is it clearer than in the property industry which makes up around a fifth of gdp New project starts fell by 45% in July compared with a year ago the value of new home sales by 29% and property investment by 12% The effects are rippling through the economy hitting furniture-makers and steelworkers alike The crisis comes at a critical time for Xi Jinping China leader who will probably be granted a third term at a party congress in October Reviving trust in the system is crucial for Mr Xi and the Communist Party Yet the government response has been disjointed and slow with officials seemingly overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation To regain faith in the housing market the public needs to see stalled projects finished Meanwhile construction firms and workers need to be reimbursed and investors paid back on their fixed-income products All this must be done without reinflating the unsustainable debt bubble that the property market has becomeThe housing crisis has two immediate causes The first is a crackdown on the property industry excesses Since August 2020 officials have restricted developers’ ratios of liabilities to assets net debt to equity and cash to short-term debt in a policy known as the three red lines This has forced many to stop unsustainable borrowing and sell down assets severely limiting their ability to continue building China zero-covid policy is a second blow The central government has forced dozens of cities to lock residents in their homes for days and sometimes weeks on end when covid cases are discovered At the time of writing the megacities of Chengdu and Shenzhen are fully or partly locked down The shutdowns have stopped people from viewing homes They have also had an impact on the consumer psyche Entrepreneurs fear the sudden closure of their businesses Employees worry about being laid off This sort of trepidation does not encourage homebuyingThe result is a crunch China developers need to sell homes long before they are built to generate liquidity Last year they pre-sold 90% of homes But without access to bonds and loans as banks cut their exposure to the property sector and with sales falling the Ponzi-like nature of the property market has come into full viewEvergrande the world most indebted developer defaulted in December An effort to restructure its offshore debts intended as a model to follow missed an end-of-July deadline At least 28 other property firms have missed payments to investors or gone into restructuring Trading in the shares of 30 Hong Kong-listed developers constituting 10% of the market by sales has been frozen according to Gavekal a research firm In early August half of China listed developers traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 05 the level that Evergrande traded at four months before it defaulted notes Song Houze of MacroPolo a think-tankFirms that just months ago were considered safe bets are now struggling Earlier this year analysts dismissed concerns that Country Garden China biggest developer by sales would come under pressure But on August 30th the firm revealed that profits for the first half of the year had fallen by almost 100% The property market has “slid rapidly into severe depression” it noted The firm difficulties indicate that problems are no longer specific to certain developers The entire industry is at riskPotential homebuyers have dropped out of the market Far more worrying though are the millions waiting often for years for homes for which they have paid Just 60% of homes that were pre-sold between 2013 and 2020 have been delivered Mr Liu who has asked to be referred to by his family name bought a flat in Zhengzhou in 2014 with an initial 250000 yuan $40000 down-payment The home was scheduled to be finished in 2017 But it never was Instead he rented a flat eventually buying another in an old building It is hardly the life he imagined Mr Liu never started paying his mortgage and has engaged in endless discussions with the property developer about getting back his down-payment “There no use” he saysAnalysts have known of these problems for years but had thought the authorities would not allow protests Two years ago a report by pwc an accounting firm noted that when building stalls the “unco-ordinated households normally have little ability to influence things” This calculation has been turned on its head A movement to collect data on the refusal to pay mortgages has taken officials by surprise On July 12th volunteers began sharing data on social media So far about 350 boycotts have been identified; analysts believe this is a fraction of the true number State censors try to remove references to the information but knowledge appears to spread nevertheless As it does others are persuaded to join inInvestors and potential homebuyers are now watching with unease as the state puts together its response For more than a decade cities have wielded a long list of rules and incentives to fine-tune real-estate markets usually to reduce speculation and cool prices These included limits over access to mortgages as well as on who can buy homes and how many they can buyCities are now loosening these rules Between May and July municipal governments announced 304 individual measures to restore confidence according to cicc a Chinese investment bank Zhengzhou at the centre of the protests was an early mover In March it announced 18 actions to stimulate demand including measures to make it easier to get mortgages and to allow families with elderly members to buy flats if they move to the city These have attracted attentionnot because they have revived demand but because they seem to contradict central-government policy In a video circulated on social media in August a local Communist Party chief in Hunan province was seen calling on people to buy as many homes as possible: “Did you buy a third one? Then buy a fourth” The message clashes with the one from Mr Xi himself who has warned that “homes are for living in” and certainly not for speculative investmentLocal governments have also been encouraged by regulators and officials to create bail-out funds to invest in unfinished housing projects and eventually to help deliver homes Zhengzhou has allocated 80bn yuan $12bn to the cause The thinking goes that local funds will be better suited to conditions on the groundZhengzhou is also trying perhaps the most aggressive plan yet City officials have issued a directive to developers that says all stalled construction must restart by October 6th Insolvent companies that cannot do so must file for restructuring to bring in new investment and repay down-payments made by homebuyers such as Mr Liu Failure to do so could result in developers being investigated for embezzlement and other serious crimesFor their part policymakers have repeatedly cut mortgage rates since mid-May To guarantee the supply of homes the central government is fully guaranteeing bond issuance by private developers shifting the risk to the state Longfor a struggling firm priced a 15bn-yuan bond at a 33% coupon rate on August 26th far below the market rate This was possible solely because the bond was underwritten by China Bond Insurance a state agency More such issuance is planned to deliver liquidity to developers the government views as higher quality It is the beginning of a programme to pick winnersAnother prong of state support takes the form of direct liquidity On August 22nd the central bank and finance ministry said that they would back special loans from state-directed policy banks to finish pre-sold homes The size of the programme has not been disclosed but Bloomberg a news service reported that 200bn yuan would be made availableThis public spending is a double-edged sword On the one hand it will help deliver homes and restart mortgage payments taking pressure off banks But at the same time the cash is filling a hole created by bad local governance and dubious property developers “That simply represents money that can’t be spent on stimulus elsewhere” notes Alex Wolf of JPMorgan Chase a bankZhengzhou efforts to encourage new buyers since March have fallen flat Conditions have continued to deteriorate suggesting that tinkering with city policies is not enough Local bail-out funds also look flimsy On paper several cities have hefty pots but they rely on local-government financing firms that are strapped for cash Analysts are watching Zhengzhou attempt to restart all construction within a month but many question if the necessary funds are available The measures could unleash collapses among smaller developers causing panic and financial turmoilInvestors have more hope in the central government but its response has so far failed to match the scale of the crisis The 200bn-yuan lending programme may account for just 10% of what is needed to complete all unfinished homes About $5trn-worth of residential property has been pre-sold since 2020 reckons Mr Song of MacroPolo making a bail-out of even a fraction of these homes incredibly costlyThe central government has more levers to pull Larry Hu of Macquarie an investment bank says a number of measures can be snapped into place These include temporarily easing the three red lines policy or vowing to act as a lender of last resort for all stalled projects The latter while expensive is fully within the central government financial wherewithalThe debate now focuses not on whether the central government can restore confidence but on how far it is willing to go The crackdown on leverage was meant to punish firms that had taken on too much debt A bigger bail-out will encourage more developers to ask for assistance pushing the government to subsidise more of the property sector writes Allen Feng of Rhodium a research firm: “quite the opposite of what was intended with the ‘three red lines’”The campaign against leverage was meant to bring the sector in line with demand Officials have long acknowledged that developers were building too much About 70% of homes sold since 2018 were bought by people who already owned one estimates JPMorgan Restricting debt was supposed to force firms to adjust to reality Demand is likely to fall as China population growth slows Home sales reached 157bn square metres in 2021 more than twice as high as in 2007 But Chen Long of Plenum another research firm projects that real annual demand will fall to 088bn-136bn square metres over the next decade as the demographic shift takes hold and urbanisation slows Reinflating the market means propping up the bubbleThe government balancing act is fraught with risk In mid-October the party congress will happen as cities lock down Mortgage boycotts will rumble on and possibly grow Confidence in China economic foundations could cross a threshold beyond which it becomes far more difficult to recover Mr Xi third term will start in inauspicious circumstances For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks

 Sep 8th 2022,Europe energy market was not built for this crisis,Most people hate fluctuating prices When they fall too far they are seen to be threatening firms When they rise too high they are seen to be unjustly enriching them But economists look at price movements and see the revelation of crucial information The recent frenzy about interventions in European electricity markets is an especially brutal example of this age-old dynamic Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn recent weeks forward prices for daytime electricity for the fourth quarter of the year briefly spiked above €1200 $1200 per megawatt hour in Germany and above a surreal €2500 in France The usual price is around €50 The reason for this is simple: scarcity The loss of generating capacity to maintenance in France closure in Germany and drought across the continent brought more and more gas plants into action and their fuel has become extremely expensive since Russia wielded its energy weapon Just like in any other market for a homogenous good the price of power is set by the most expensive supplier This means that even power plants with low operating costs such as nuclear ones or wind farms receive the high prices that gas plants are charging The result is vast profitsand public outrage Based on forward curves Morgan Stanley a bank reckons that electricity spending in the eu could rise by more than €800bn an increase worth an astonishing six percentage points of gdp Thus politicians have started to ask whether a different pricing mechanism is needed The problem is that designing an electricity market is hard The juice cannot yet be stored at scale and has to be delivered at the exact moment it is needed Producers need to spend a lot of money upfront to build a windmill or power plant and need to be able to recover it and make a profit over decades Climate-change policies dictate that more and more renewable electricity is fed into the system despite being mostly at the whim of wind and sunshine Europe current design is a sequence of markets some continent-wide where electricity providers such as power plants meet retail suppliers large industrial customers and others Some deals are made months or even years before electricity is delivered as suppliers and customers need clarity over revenues and costs The reference price for electricity and for the settlement of many long-term agreements is set on the spot market where the physical delivery of electricity is traded for the next day Suppliers bid according to how much it would cost to provide an extra unit of power known as its marginal cost The idea behind this is straightforward To generate electricity at low cost and in an increasingly carbon-free manner requires a lot of information Some technologies such as nuclear are good at providing a constant stream of power Gas is good for firing up quickly Solar is best around lunchtime The marginal price of power provides the information needed to switch between them by signalling the value of an additional unit of electricity The market also provides incentives to use power when it is cheapest to generate Currently prices are lowest at lunchtime and in the night The transition to renewable energy means that prices will become more volatile But that volatility is what drives innovation and investment in storage smart meters and hydrogen A high-capacity battery and the storage it provides will be most useful when prices oscillate between extremes For a while it looked as though the problem with Europe market was that prices were too low With more and more renewable energy entering the market the price of electricity sometimes fell to zero and even turned negative The question was how marginal gas power plantsthat might be needed to cover a windless cloudy winter daycould make enough money during the rest of the year to survive Some countries opted to add a capacity market; that is they auctioned off payments to generators just for being there Others stuck with an “energy-only market” The question now is very different Europe markets face sky-high prices for electricity as the result of a war It is a situation for which they were not designed Thus policymakers face three challenges The first is to preserve the marginal-price signal for both generators and consumers in the face of political pressure to weaken it Lowering prices for example by subsidising gas used in electricity generation as Spain and Portugal have done would elsewhere require some other form of rationing to allocate scarce energy Spain and Portugal can get away without rationing because Spain is an important gas hub so can easily import moreThe second is how and if to redistribute profits The German government has recently decided to grab those it considers excessive while leaving the price signal alone The European Commission may advise countries to do something similar It will do this through what is essentially a windfall tax that limits the share of the spot-market price that suppliers can keep The problem is that generators have hedged their exposure to differing degrees meaning the true recipients of the windfall profits may prove hard to find and may in fact sit outside the energy market Bright sparks neededThe third is to ensure that Europe energy market is ready for the next crisis and to do so without sacrificing its advantages At present the spot market efficiently allocates capacity and provides signals on energy scarcity offering an incentive for investment in renewables But to guard against sustained shortfalls in capacity and thus another price crunch Europe energy markets must adapt Long-term hedging markets are not very liquid because consumers used to see little need for price security In the future they will probably see more Regulators could help A proposal by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology advises them to buy “affordability options” from generators a form of insurance that would return profits from excessive prices to consumers in effect creating an automatic windfall tax How politicians would love to have something like that in place now Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Central bankers worry that a new era of high inflation is beginning Sept 1stHow to avoid energy rationing Aug 27thDoes unemployment really have to rise to bring down inflation?

 Sep 8th 2022,Why the dollar is strong and why that is a problem,Here are a few familiar descriptions of the dollar: “the cleanest shirt in the laundry basket” “the least-ugly mug in a beauty contest” “the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind” Nobody it seems loves the dollar; they just really dislike the alternatives And that aversion is only growing The dxy an index of the dollar against half a dozen major currencies is at a 20-year high see chart 1 Among the dirtiest of the dirty linen are sterling the euro and the yen see chart 2 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvery fresh lurch upwards prompts some big questions First what is driving it? Much of the recent rise reflects differences in monetary policy At the turn of the year the Federal Reserve became more determined to tackle inflation A series of interest-rate increases since then with more expected has turned the dollar into a high-yielding currency Lofty interest rates are a draw to global capital which in turn has pushed up the dollar The dollar is also a refuge in troubled times Scared investors tend to reach for the currency And high oil and gas prices are generally bad for energy importers such as Europe but good for energy exporters such as America The handful of currencies that have kept pace with or beaten the dollar this year tend to be those of energy-producing countries In short the dollar is the go-to currency largely because America has proved a reliable source of economic growth That is particularly true now Europe is edging closer to recession The closely watched purchasing-managers’ index suggests the euro-zone economy shrank in August Less noticed is that Asia is also losing steam Sluggish export growth is the latest worry for China economy the vitality of which has been sapped by a property hangover and the country zero-covid policy China weakness is apparent across Asia Industrial output fell sharply in South Korea Taiwan and Japan in July Export orders have slumped High energy costs have not helped The currencies of these countries have wilted against the dollar In Japan where the central bank has stuck with ultra-low interest rates the authorities have hinted that they may intervene to halt the yen slide In China there has been renewed action to support the yuan So is the dollar now a problem? In principle its strength is a remedy for unbalanced global growth since it gives European and Asian exporters an edge over domestic producers in the stronger American market In practice a strong dollar makes matters worse It squeezes global credit because countries and companies beyond America borders borrow in dollars So when the dollar rises it becomes more expensive to pay back debts out of local-currency revenues For many emerging-market economies the higher cost of dollar borrowing trumps the boost to exports they get from a weaker currency Dollar strength may not even be a boon for rich countries says Steve Englander of Standard Chartered a bank Exporters in Europe are hamstrung by energy disruptions so cannot take full competitive advantage of a favourable exchange rate Will the dollar ever weaken? For that three conditions need to be met First the global growth gap has to narrow A hard landing in America won’t do the trick A synchronised downturn in all regions of the world would only spark a run to the safety of the dollar although the beleaguered yen might finally catch a bid What is needed is for growth prospects outside America to improve A second condition is a rapid reduction in price and wage pressures in America This would allow the Fed to ease off the monetary brake withdrawing some yield support from the dollar The third condition is related to the first two: a weaker dollar requires some kind of good news on global energy Absent that it is hard to see Europe closing the growth gap with America None of these conditions seems likely to be met soon Until they are the dollar will stay mightybut only because the yen the euro and the rest are so puny For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

Ethereum researcher who created a meme showing two bears one black and one white doing the “fusion dance” from “Dragon Ball z” a popular anime show In the show the dance fuses two creatures into a single stronger one The pandaa combination of the two bearshas since become a symbol for “the merge”The merge is the name the crypto-community has given to the point at which the Ethereum blockchain will transition from using “proof-of-work” as a consensus mechanismthe method by which all the computers maintaining a blockchain agree to add new transactions to itto using “proof-of-stake” They call it the merge because for almost two years a separate proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon chain has been running alongside the original Ethereum one for developers to test improve and test again The Zoom call is for the developers to agree on when the two chains will join together The date and time of the event will depend on how much computer power is being used to maintain the blockchain but should happen at around 1am utc on September 15thThis is no mere technical tweak It is a complete overhaul of a $200bn software project that has been running for seven years which will if all goes to plan be implemented with no downtime People in crypto compare the process to changing the engine of an aeroplane mid-flight Proof-of-work is hugely energy intensive requiring vast amounts of computing power and has resulted in blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin consuming as much energy as small countries Proof-of-stake will require 999% less energy to operate The effect on emissions will be as though overnight Chile had been switched off see chart 1 More important still the merge will if successful show that Ethereum has the capacity for self-improvement opening the door to more sweeping changesCrypto is in need of good news for the past year has been a torrid one A handful of dodgy deposit-taking ventures have gone bust wiping out savings; a crypto hedge fund has blown up; a stablecoin was revealed to be anything but stable The total market capitalisation of crypto has crashed to around $1trn about $2trn lower than it was this time last year Ethereum improvements would not unpick any of this destruction But by reducing crypto environmental impact and highlighting the potential for future improvements it would suggest that it has a brighter future than many now appreciateThe idea for the Ethereum blockchain was first published in 2014 by Mr Buterin As with Bitcoin it is a large database of all the transactions that have ever taken place in the cryptocurrency But Mr Buterin crucial insight was that the blockchain could do much more than thatit could also keep track of lines of code This allows Ethereum to record transfers of the currency but also of all the assets and functions that are maintained in “smart contracts” self-executing agreements in which a chain of actions follows when certain conditions are met This capability has made it possible for developers to build a large network of financial institutions such as exchanges and lenders in code on the Ethereum blockchainThe blockchain is maintained by about a dozen pieces of software called “clients” that are worked on by the core developers These are built in a variety of programming languages including Go Rust Java and C# and the software is run by the “nodes”computers that run the client software to maintain the history of the Ethereum blockchain All decisions about what to do and whether upgrades will be implemented are made by a consensus among developers people who hold ether the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and people who have built applications on top of Ethereum or listed real-world assets on the blockchain Any plans and code are published in real time on GitHub a repository for programmers The core developers meet as pandas or otherwise to discuss potential upgrades every two weeks Anyone can in theory become a core developer just by working on the software The result is that developers are a rag-tag bunch Some are employed by firms like ConsenSys a Brooklyn-based blockchain-software outfit established by Joe Lubin one of the handful of people who helped found Ethereum after Mr Buterin white paper in 2014 Some are employed by the Ethereum Foundation a non-profit organisation set up in Zug Switzerland in 2014 with the proceeds of the sale of ether tokens Others are hobbyists incentivised to help out because they hold tokens At least 122 developers in 30 countries have worked on the merge software Ethereum is not a company and Mr Buterin for all his clout and importance as its creator is not its chief executive It is open-sourcemuch like Linux an operating system and Firefox a web browserbut the ability to buy a stake in its success through ether tokens provides an incentive to get involved in maintenance The extent to which governance is truly decentralised is not entirely clear In a recent interview with Noah Smith an economics blogger Mr Buterin said that at the start of the project in 2015 he was doing most of the research and thinking about what Ethereum should be as well as a lot of the coding to make it a reality By 2020 he was doing perhaps only a third of the research very little coding but most of the “high-level theorising” In the past two years he said even the high-level theory “has been slowly but surely slipping away from me”To implement a change like the merge requires sufficient consensus among the interested parties All the major clients must be rewritten to use the new code enough nodes must update their software and all the applications layered on the blockchainlike stablecoins backed by dollars in bank accountsmust accept the new merged chain is the one that will maintain the status of their assets It can be surreal to watch in real time It is as if The Economist started to live stream its editorial meetings and allowed subscribers to commission articles and select coversThe miners strikeNor are all the interested parties in favour of the merge Miners have invested as much as $5bn in hardware to run the proof-of-work consensus mechanism On September 15th or thereabouts that hardware will no longer earn them much of a return The way proof-of-work maintains the security of a blockchain is by incentivising hundreds of thousands of computers to solve a mathematical puzzle The computer that first finds a solution alerts the other miners and if they confirm the result updates the blockchain and is paid As such it pays in lovely freshly minted ether to have lots of mining hardware Proof-of-stake makes decisions about updating the blockchain by a vote among the holders of a cryptocurrency Voting power as well as the share of the rewards depends on how much ether has been staked If stakers misbehave such as by putting through faulty transactions their stake can be destroyed Thus on September 15th the advantage of having lots of mining hardware will disappear Instead the advantage will be in holding ether Miners could attempt to put off the merge by revolting But the nodes appear to be mostly going along with the update According to ethernode a website that tracks Ethereum activity around 75% have updated their software to be ready The alternative is to attempt to “fork” the blockchain by still running the old software and hoping that enough others do the same that the old version of the blockchain will continue to exist A dispute over a hack in 2016 led to Ethereum splitting into two chains: Ethereum the dominant one and “Ethereum Classic” a much smaller one For a split this time “there basically needs to be one single miner in the world who decides they want to continue with the proof of work” meaning there almost certainly will be one says Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation The question is how many miners stick and how many twist Chandler Guo who supported the Ethereum Classic fork in 2016 is attempting to organise miners around a proof-of-work token called “ethw” “I fork Ethereum once I will fork it again!” he has said Although the miners have reason to stay with the old way of doing things the economics of trying a forked chain will probably not add up It will only make sense to mine ethw if the value of the token is worth enough And a version of Ethereum minus DeFi apps stablecoins and developers is probably not worth very much Institutions such as Circle a stablecoin operator have thrown their weight behind the new approach rather than any forks In a statement on August 9th the firm said that it “intends to fully and solely support the Ethereum proof-of-stake chain post-merge” Wallet operators and exchanges are also backing the proof-of-stake chain These dynamics reveal the balance of power inherent in Ethereum The developers cannot put through updates that are universally hated because doing so would cause a messy fork; the miners cannot resist an update if everyone else supports it The decisions made by those that run applications on top of the blockchain like Circle can help solve disputes between the camps This is very different from traditional tech platforms Apple can push through an update that neither iPhone users nor app developers like and there is little either group can do about it short of ditching iPhones altogether There is no such thing as a “forked” iPhone The way Ethereum gets to a consensus is “kind of a messy and ad-hoc process” admits Mr Drake But there are enormous benefits if things go well The impact of the overnight elimination of its energy needs will be thinly spread as Ethereum is mined all over the world Almost half the nodes are in America; around a tenth are in Germany Other countries like Singapore Britain and Finland are home to less than 5% But in smaller countries where mining is disproportionately popular like Singapore it is possible energy prices could fall The change also reduces the need for mining hardware Nvidia a chipmaker makes graphics cards for gaming that can also be used for mining ether From May to July in part fuelled by rumours of an impending merge revenues from its chips fell by almost half compared with the previous three months On eBay prices of second-hand graphic cards are tumblingSince the network will no longer need so much energy and hardware to maintain it rewards for validating transactions can be reduced “With proof of work the scarce resource offered in return for rewards is computing power That is very expensive because you have to pay for electricity bills and you have to cover hardware costs” notes Mr Drake With proof of stake the scarce resource is instead digital money “So the maintenance cost is essentially the opportunity cost of that money which is maybe 3% or 4%” Thus Ethereum will pay out just 10% as many tokens per block validated by stakers post-merge as it did to miners before it This change in the monetary system is probably one reason why since the timing of the merge began to firm up in mid-July ether prices have jumped The currency has climbed by almost 50% even as bitcoin and other crypto tokens have traded sideways see chart 2 Ethereum boosters think a successful merge could pave the way for “the flippening” when the market capitalisation of ether surpasses that of bitcoin for the first time It is currently about half as valuable as its rival cryptocurrency which is close to its highest share since 2017 The other big benefit is security At the moment to take control of the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain an attacker needs 51% of the total computing power used to mine the currency Rough estimates put the cost of this at $5bn-10bn To attack a proof-of-stake blockchain would require buying up and staking half of all tokens which would currently cost around $20bn Some think these benefits will come at the cost of centralising power since under proof-of-stake big holders reap more rewards increasing their holdings further But says Ben Edgington of ConsenSys the blockchain-software firm this argument is wrong-headed Small stakes will earn less than big stakes but they will hold the same percentage of total outstanding tokens through time meaning their relative power will not change With proof-of-work there are also returns to scale from building huge mining rigs which are more efficient “There is no way someone could set up a competitive at-home mining rig” notes Mr EdgingtonBlocking progressAnother risk is that the transition fails in some way which could undermine public support Mr Lubin Ethereum co-founder is unperturbed He says “there has just been so much testing that I think the blockchain elements will go perfectly smoothly” The only potential missing link in the transition Mr Edgington thinks is the wider community Given the complications in installing new components and the need to get to grips with a new way of working some participants may be lost But there will only be problems if more than 40% are and that is unlikely he says Applications such as exchanges that run on top of the blockchain may though experience some hiccups Major software updates reveal all kinds of bugs in previously sound-looking code Important DeFi apps like Aave a lending platform are readying themselves by suspending transactions in ether over the merge periodIf all goes smoothly the merge will be a step towards a much more useful technology Many of the financial applications that operate on top of the blockchain are extremely efficient in part because they automate the functions of a financial system Smart contracts automatically match buyers and sellers or borrowers and lenders at an exchange An imf paper found that the marginal costs of financial intermediation by DeFi apps were about a third as much as rich-country banks and a fifth of emerging-market banks But the efficiency for users is hampered by how slow and expensive using the Ethereum blockchain can be At times when the network is busy the charges to have transactions recorded called “gas fees” can spike to as much as $100 for a single transaction Upgrades after the merge are mostly aimed at improving scale and efficiency In July at an Ethereum conference in Paris Mr Buterin joked that the path for the blockchain is first to “merge” and then “surge” “verge” “purge” and “splurge” The surge next on the list refers to “sharding” which is the process of splitting a database into pieces to spread the load This will allow the blockchain to process many more transactions and should reduce the fees required to use it ”Ethereum today can process about 15-20 transactions a second This Ethereum…it going to be able to process 100000 transactions a second” Mr Buterin proclaimedThe verge will implement a new kind of mathematical proof known as “Verkle trees” and make “stateless clients” possible That will mean someone can run the software to operate a node without having to store the entire “state” of the blockchain an enormous amount of data The purge will remove old data on the blockchain history The splurge is “all of the other fun stuff” which could be anything that Mr Buterin and the cryptoheads fancy A successful merge is the first step on the path towards all of these changes It would prove that decentralised groups of people can do risky contentious and important things Time to find out if they can Clarification September 7th 2022: An earlier version of this article did not attribute some of Mr Buterin quotes to an interview by Mr Smith This attribution has now been addedFor more expert

 Sep 5th 2022,The digital yuan offers China a way to dodge the dollar,In recent military drills China has simulated an invasion of Taiwan which it considers a “renegade province” Talk of war has preoccupied Chinese bloggers pundits and politicians since Nancy Pelosi speaker of America House of Representatives visited Taipei in AugustListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFinance officials in Beijing have no doubt been prepping for a conflict too They have watched with dismay as America and its allies imposed crippling sanctions on Russian banks and kicked seven of them out of swift a Belgium-based messaging network used to send payment instructions A Chinese invasion of Taiwan could result in similar measures freezing Chinese banking activity abroad In a shooting war over Taiwan no one knows who would win In a financial war an American victory seems assuredChina dependence on the dollar has long been a source of frustration in Beijing It not only cements China vulnerability to sanctions but also exposes China to America macroeconomic whims To many officials it is perverse that their country the world largest exporter and official creditor should rely so heavily on the currency of the world biggest importer and borrower For over a decade China has tried to promote the yuan as an alternative Yet progress has been hampered by another source of Chinese discomfort: uncontrolled capital flows see chart 1 China limits on the movement of its moneyin place to prevent speculationmake the yuan difficult for the world to embrace Thus few bankers think the yuan will soon replace the dollar as the world currency of choice But that is not the only prize worth pursuing Other goals are more feasible and more urgent In particular China technocrats aspire to build a payments system that is easier for its trading partners to use and harder for America to block They might also hope that such a system could make the yuan more influential abroad without compromising China capital controls at homeNew technology might help Since May 2020 China has been experimenting with a digital version of the yuan now known as the e-cny Residents of 23 pilot zones across 15 provinces can download “e-wallets” onto their phones The wallets are provided by their banks or popular payment platforms like Alipay But the e-cny they contain represent a claim on the central bank itself Some 260m individuals and 45m shops can now handle the digital yuan according to the People Bank of China pboc the central bank Thanks to promotions and handouts the digital currency has been used in over 260m transactions worth about 83bn yuan $12bn since its inception until the end of May with an average transaction size of about 300 yuan China insists the e-cny is first and foremost for domestic use Officials were spooked by innovations like Libra and Diem the digital currencies proposed by Facebook They also want a secure backstop and perhaps a rival to Alipay and WeChat Pay the hegemonic private payment platforms For this reason the e-cny has been designed for retail use It can be held by individuals and non-financial firms rather than just banksYet a few Chinese scholars are willing to voice greater ambitions Sun Lijian of Fudan University has argued that a digital yuan might help break the dollar monopolistic status and could be used to finance projects associated with the Belt and Road Initiative China overseas infrastructure-building programme Some of the biggest believers in the e-cny potential seem to be wary observers in America A recent book published by the Hoover Institution a think-tank argues that the e-cny could play an important role in internationalising the yuan and “transforming the geo-economic landscape” In particular “it is likely that countries seeking to circumvent us sanctions will explore using the e-cny as an alternative channel for cross-border transactions” it notedThe e-cny could help internationalise the yuan in several ways It could make it easier and cheaper for foreigners to make cross-border paymentsand harder for America to block those transactions for geopolitical purposes That would increase the appeal of the yuan even if China capital controls remained in place The digital yuan could also change the way those controls work by programming them into the currency itselfWithin China e-cny payments are quick and free for now The central bank may charge a fee in future according to Caixin a Chinese magazine to operators of the wallets and linked services if not to end users The pboc has made no announcements about how an overseas user might receive a wallet But China bankers are full of speculation Some believe Chinese regulators will set up a special financial zone where users abroad could apply for wallets Here banks and other financial-services firms would be invited to create “know-your-customer” businesses for the screening of applicants Foreign users might eventually be allowed to do this remotely through Chinese banks in their home countriesOnce a foreigner has qualified for a wallet e-cny transactions with other wallet-holders should be quick and cheap even if they are separated by a geographical border In the early stages most transactions would be with Chinese firms or customers But once the number of foreign wallet-holders reaches a critical mass some payments need not have a Chinese user on the other side of the tradeCross-currency transactions seem a more distant prospect But China experiment with the e-cny has spurred many other governments to look into digital currencies of their own and how they might be exchanged with each other Take for example mBridge a programme set up by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and joined by the pboc the central banks of Thailand and United Arab Emirates and the Bank for International Settlements a club of central banks in Switzerland One initial aim is to enable digital-currency transactions in the Greater Bay Area a large region in southern China where three currencies the yuan the Hong Kong dollar and Macau pataca now operate The involvement of other central banks indicates mBridge long-term ambitions are much largerPlatforms like these could eventually help settle international payments at a fraction of the expense of the current correspondent-banking model The cost of sending a $500 remittance through a bank from South Africa to China now averages over 14% or $70 see chart 2 The technologies underlying digital currencies have been found to cut the transaction energy and storage costs connected with these legacy systems Moving away from centralised clearing and creating competition among various platforms could also help bring down costs For China the project is strategic not commercial and therefore it will almost certainly seek to undercut other systems on price notes a recent paper by Ross Buckley of the University of South Wales Douglas Arner of the University of Hong Kong and others Such systems might also be less vulnerable to sanctions America response to Russia war in Ukraine has shown that Western powers can debilitate foreign banks by kicking them out of swift America can also bar its financial institutions from dealing with a country under sanctions making it impossible for the country banks to settle dollar payments with the rest of the world Payments in digital yuan would use neither the dollar nor swift and could conceivably bypass commercial-banking institutions altogetherThe e-cny might make America financial weapons less convenient and less precise thus raising the bar to their use But it would not spike them altogether Even if America could not directly prevent an e-cny transaction from going through it could still deny access to its clearing system to any institution using the e-cny in a way it did not like ie to serve a blacklisted country Since America could not monitor e-cny activity as closely as it can monitor dollar payments some transactions might escape its notice Yet if the inscrutable e-cny became too big a threat to its sanctions regime America could in theory ban its use by any institution that wants to retain access to the American clearing system That would force the world to choose between the dollar and the digital yuan Remote capital controlsLower transaction costs and less vulnerability to sanctions could make the e-cny more appealing to foreigners Other characteristics of the digital yuan could make its overseas use less nerve-wracking for China authorities Officials worry less about capital leaving the country than about it leaving the currency They are fairly relaxed about Chinese residents and firms accumulating yuan-denominated claims on the rest of the world But they worry about runs on the currency especially if those runs develop speculative momentum In China regulators can limit the amount of yuan that residents are allowed to sell for foreign currency They can also quiz residents about why they want dollars Regulators do not have the same control over non-residents especially if non-residents hold yuan in foreign banksSeveral aspects of China existing financial plumbing betray this nervousness Its own cross-border interbank payments system cips has been slow to admit foreign banks for example Within this system yuan payments can leave China but stay within a trusted circle of largely Chinese intermediaries Its “Wealth Connect” programme introduced last year creates another kind of closed loop It allows rich individuals in China to buy investment products in Hong Kong thereby gaining exposure to assets denominated in foreign currencies But when they cash out of those investments they may do so only in yuan This stops people from moving trunk-loads of yuan out of China The e-cny could enable another closed loop Transactions in e-cny take place across the balance-sheet of China central bank That makes it easier for the authorities to monitor the use of China currency even among non-residents Because the e-cny can only pass between approved e-wallets China authorities could also weed out potential speculators during the approval process Digital wallets would be likely to encode a number of user characteristics such as their country of residence and the industry they work in These sorts of details could be used to grant or deny people and firms access to yuan payments or limit their payments to certain sizes China could then be confident that any digital yuan circulating outside its borders would not fall into the wrong hands for the wrong reasons With such control academics speculate that demand for e-cny among unsavoury parties would be lowChina digital currency is also “programmable” The e-cny can be distributed with conditions such as a time frame for spending it In theory any condition can be programmed into digital currencies says Michael Sung of FreeFlow Finance a cross-border payments firm Regulators could for example set limits on how much could be sold for foreign currencies That would help them to limit any runs on the currency even if the yuan were held by foreigners beyond their normal regulatory reachImagine for example that e-cny wallets were granted to a number of grain traders in Africa alongside related businesses such as farmers pesticides vendors and logistics firms Money lent to these companies could be programmed to be exchangeable only with approved companies within this supply chain The pboc could also monitor payment flows closely Cashing out the e-cny into other currencies with unapproved banks could be easily stoppedSuch control and a god eye view of the currency could make the pboc more comfortable with allowing flows of its currency into trade finance and supply chains Charles Chang of Fudan University points out that authorities have already been experimenting with changes to yuan-convertibility rules in Hainan Officials have said that Hainan will become a free-trade port by 2035 They aim to make the island province an offshore trade and finance centre much like Hong Kong As Mr Chang notes it is not hard to imagine this type of finance zone being used as a base to conduct digital-yuan trade financeBut will users outside of China want it? In poorer countries probably yes Securing financing in dollars in poor parts of Africa can be incredibly difficult Supply is limited Business owners often wait weeks and pay hefty fees and bribes for access Many firms in poorer countries already opt for yuan-based trade finance when it is available A switch to e-cny could only help as long as there is ample supply of it and overseas users can get digital walletsA restricted currency is naturally less appealing than an unrestricted one just as food stamps are worth less than their equivalent in cash So a programmed digital yuan would be less appealing than a currency free of restrictions Yet if China conventional currency remains hard to come by because of the government nervousness about speculation and misuse then the digital yuan could be a viable alternative It would be less freely usable but more freely available Moreover most users of a currency have no intention of panic-selling the currency unless everyone else does So technological speed bumps designed to prevent runs need not be fatal to the digital yuan international appealMuch of this is still speculation As tensions rise with America the domestic roll-out of e-cny will bring little comfort to Chinese technocrats who fret about imminent conflict In the long-term though the digital currency will be more significant It may eventually help the yuan span the world without leaving its lane For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 1st 2022,Distressed-debt investors are preparing to pounce,Hedge funds are used to being the star players in corporate America most aggressive sport: financial distress They search for value in the liabilities of troubled firms often hoping to participate in the restructuring of a company balance-sheet And after a decade of unpleasantly benign financial conditions excitement in the industry is building A toxic cocktail of rising interest rates slowing growth and high inflation is already creating pockets of distress High-yield debt issuance has dried up see chart and it is increasingly difficult for companies to refinance their liabilities or raise fresh funds In July the amount of distressed debt which includes bonds yielding more than ten percentage points over Treasuries and loans trading at heavy discounts surpassed $240bn nearly three times as much as at the start of MayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDistressed-debt investors have waited a long time for conditions like these Their approach was born in the aftermath of the 1980s leveraged-finance boom but came of age during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 when the face value of distressed and defaulted debt reached $36trn Lehman Brothers a former investment bank contributed more than $600bn of that Since 2011 funds have raised around $500bn in anticipation of more distress but have had few opportunities to spend it A decade of low interest rates made borrowing easy and distress rare Even the covid-19 pandemic turned out to be a false dawn since the door to liquidity was held open by massive central-bank stimulusAlthough clouds are now gathering in credit markets distressed-debt investors will not have things all their own way Instead they will have to adjust to a new balance of power between lenders and borrowers Lending to risky companies in the past decade has been not only vast but loose Maintenance covenants financial commitments which lenders can use as a “stick” to force a restructuring have all but disappeared Combined with low interest payments their absence means it will take longer for lenders to get companies to join them at the negotiating table That is if distressed-debt investors can purchase debt in the first place Today it is common for leveraged-loan documentation to include blacklists to prevent specialist funds from buying inOnce at the table an emboldened opponent awaits One trend in particular has sent the secretive tight-knit world of distressed-debt investing into a spin: aggressive “priming” transactions which involve subordinating secured lenders In one variation the borrowing company transfers collateral backing its existing loans to a subsidiary free from creditors’ rights This allows the company to re-use the collateral to raise new debt in effect shoving the original lenders down the pecking order if it comes to divvying up assets After shifting around its valuable intellectual property in this fashion JCrew the preppy American clothing brand became a verb Since then the creditors of companies including Revlon a beauty brand Golden Nugget a chain of hotels and casinos and Travelport a tourism firm have all been said to be “JCrewed”Another new tactic involves a company working with a group of its creditors encouraging them to engage in what is ominously referred to as “creditor-on-creditor violence” In one type of “uptier” transaction a company persuades a majority of its creditors to amend loan documentation to allow it to incur more senior debt Lenders who consent are generously rewarded often by participating in this new raise watching the priority and value of their rival lenders’ debt decline In other words borrowing companies pay Peter by allowing him to take money from PaulIn March a court in New York concluded that one manoeuvre undertaken in 2020 by Serta Simmons Bedding a mattress manufacturer may have breached the firm credit agreement Legal challenges to similar transactions are rumbling on and loans increasingly include tighter wording to prevent these deals But while uptier transactions and other similar moves are disputed they are a long way from vanquishedDistressed-debt investors should not be surprised by these new challenges For the story of the past decade cheap leverage is also that of private equity which spent $850bn on leveraged buy-outs in 2021 alone A recent study by Vincent Buccola at the University of Pennsylvania explains the rise of hardball tactics in this light According to his analysis 18 of the 19 priming transactions undertaken to date have involved a private-equity sponsor Private-equity executives with personal fortunes at stake and an Olympic capacity for legal gymnastics are proving considerably more adversarial than the sleepy corporate-management teams of oldThus Wall Street most sophisticated operators increasingly shape the tactics of both lender and borrower providing a vivid illustration of the triumph of finance over the real economy After a decade of loose lending and buy-outs increased corporate distress is now almost inevitable The erosion of creditors’ protections will leave distressed-debt investors waiting longer to capitalise on this chaos When they do reach the boardroom expect some gladiatorial clashes For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money

one below it is ominous A true chartist needs only such information and “does not even care to know what business or industry a company is in as long as he or she can study its chart” as Burton Malkiel an economist at Princeton and author of “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” has noted These methods though patently mad have attracted attention lately because of how the s&p 500 the leading index of American stocks has wiggled around After slumping to a low of 3637 on June 17th the index began to climb On August 16th it peaked at an intraday high of around 4325 a whisker away from its 200-day moving average of 4326a supposedly critical technical level An asset that has fallen in price but is rising is supposed to meet “resistance” at such levels To chartists it is concerning when an asset fails to “break through” a resistance barrierit is an indication of a bear-market rally rather than a true bull market And so this time it appears to have been: stocks have slumped by around 8% since August 16thPlenty of mainstream investors use some version of trend-following Factor investing invented by Eugene Fama the Nobel prize-winning economist and Kenneth French is used by successful quantitative funds like aqr Capital Management It breaks down returns into component factors like “size” small companies earn better returns than bigger ones or “quality” low-debt stable businesses earn better returns than riskier ones Another such factor is momentum: stocks that are rising tend to keep rising Still their approach is a little more sophisticated than looking at a price chart aqr algorithms tend to combine factors like momentum with others They might buy say a small or high-quality firm whose share price has recently risenIt is nevertheless possible to understand the chartists’ obsession with levels and trends There is no real difference between a euro being worth $10001 or $09999 but these “big figures” in foreign-exchange markets assume importance This is in part symbolic and in part practical: clients tend to place orders near round numbers and derivatives tend to be sold with round “strike prices” That means it will take a lot more activity for the euro to fall from $10001 to $09999 than for it to fall from $10487 to $10485 When placing orders investors try to figure out where others are placing theirs That can help them place a stop-loss order to close a trade that moves against them at a sensible level If enough investors look at technical levels to inform their behaviour then they begin to matter Perhaps the real value of technical analysis is what its use tells you about market conditions No one bothers with the chartists’ pretty drawings when the economy is good profits are high and stocks are moving smoothly highernor indeed in the depths of a frantic bear market when prices will plunge through any and all levels technical analysts are wont to draw Much as people who are feeling restless about the direction of their lives are more prone to become interested in astrology investors who are uneasy about the direction of the markets will reach for the easy reassurance of an eye-catching diagram That some are laying the blame for the end of the summer rally on a technical tripwire suggests they have little idea what is really going on Perhaps Buttonwood should derive a technical indicator of her own: the more regularly chartist analysis lands in her inbox the clearer it is that no one has any clue as to why the markets are movingCorrection September 2nd 2022: An earlier version of this article said Eugene Fama and Kenneth French won the Nobel prize for their work on factor investing They did not Mr Fama won a Nobel prize for his work on the efficient-markets hypothesis Mr French is yet to win a Nobel Sorry Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Investors are optimistic about equities They have no alternative Aug 18thReminiscences of a financial columnist Jul 30thThe Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 1st 2022,China and America long-awaited audit deal may yet fail,At some point in September a team of American inspectors will touch down on Chinese soil in the hope of doing something miraculous: freely inspecting the internal auditing paperwork of Chinese firms listed on American exchanges The agreement to do so announced on August 26th has been a decade in the making and could prevent the delisting of some $940bn in Chinese shares that trade in New York Success however is still far from guaranteed Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSince 2011 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board pcaob an auditing governance body has demanded that accounting firms auditing New York-listed Chinese companies open the companies’ books for inspection These reviews were made all the more urgent by repeated instances of fraud by Chinese firms Yet the Chinese government had pushed back at times declaring such paperwork “state secrets” and threatening criminal charges against anyone who reveals themA law passed in America in 2020 the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act gave auditors three years to comply before their Chinese clients were forcibly delisted When in March the Securities and Exchange Commission America market watchdog published a list of firms slated for delisting it caused the sharpest fall in American-traded Chinese stocks in more than a decade In mid-August fears of impending financial turmoil grew when five Chinese state-owned companies voluntarily delisted from American exchanges For their part regulators in Beijing had sent a cold message to investors in America A crackdown on Didi Global a Chinese ride-hailing firm just days after it listed in New York implied that the Chinese government cared little about the reputation of companies listed on foreign markets All this means the deal between the pcaob and the China Securities Regulatory Commission csrc comes as a welcome surprise It seems to show that leaders in Beijing still see some value in financial links with Americadefying predictions of an imminent financial decoupling between the world two largest economies Signing the deal may have been the easy part however Lawyers working on cross-border regulatory arrangements note that carrying it out will be fraught with risks The statements released by the pcaob and the csrc are contradictory in places The Americans note that they will not need to go through Chinese authorities to access documents There can be “no loopholes and no exceptions” their statement says The Chinese say all arrangements will be done through the csrc A single disagreement on access could end up derailing the entire dealGiven the Chinese government sensitivity around data the inspections could be awkward The pcaob can examine documents not just from the current year but from a few years back While the most recent audit documents may have been prepared without the data disclosures that China considers a national-security risk documents requested from previous years may still contain sensitive information notes Travis Lundy of Smartkarma a research firmThat might help explain why even though the deal has been signed the market is so far pricing in only a 50% chance of eventual success according to analysts at Goldman Sachs a bank Agreements between China and America have a poor record when it comes to implementation Analysts at Bernstein a broker reminded investors of another high-profile pact meant to patch up relations: “Remember the Trump phase one trade deal?” That agreement failed miserably For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 31st 2022,Europe is heading for recession How bad will it be?,Editor note September 2nd 2022: On September 2nd Gazprom said that its Nord Stream 1 pipeline would not resume supplies of gas to Europe on September 3rd as originally plannedEvery single warning light is flashing red Russia war on Ukraine an uneven recovery from the covid-19 pandemic and a drought across much of the continent have conspired to create a severe energy crunch high inflation supply disruptionsand enormous uncertainty about Europe economic future Governments are rushing to try to help the most vulnerable Amid the nervous confusion there is broad agreement on one thing: a recession is comingListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKQuite how bad the downturn will be depends on how the energy shock plays out and how policymakers respond to it This week energy prices reached once-unimaginable heights: more than €290 $291 per megawatt hour mwh for benchmark gas to be delivered in the fourth quarter of the year the usual pre-pandemic price was around €30; and more than €1200 per mwh for daytime electricity for the same quarter in Germany up from around €60 Because gas is the marginal fuel in most European electricity markets it sets the price for power more broadlyThe European economy entered the crisis in a reasonably strong position The labour market is still relatively healthy with unemployment at 66%meaning by Europe mediocre standards that the economy is near to full employment Wage growth will probably pick up in the coming months as long-term contracts are renegotiated Consumer confidence fell at the beginning of the war but consumption didn’t slump Inflation expectations have subsided somewhat Yet things will look considerably gloomier in a few months for three reasons First industry is under pressure In the spring the leaders of Europe largest manufacturers argued that cutting off Russian gas supplies too swiftly would bring economic crisis to the continent Despite high prices industrial production has so far remained strong “Part of the reason is that firms are still working off the backlog of orders from the past” says Michael Hüther from the German Economic Institute a think-tank But these backlogs will not last for ever and some crucial forward-looking indicators are grim “New orders minus inventoriesthat is the demands on firms that keep them busyhave fallen off a cliff” says Robin Brooks at the Institute of International Finance which represents banks and institutional investors The decline reflects a weakening global and in particular Chinese economy As Mr Brooks notes such a drop can mark a turning-point in the economic cycleThe worst-affected industries will probably be east of the Rhine Recent surveys of industrial bosses in Germany and Austria point towards contraction Germany unhealthy reliance on Chinese buyers risks dragging down demand for goods across the Teutonic supply chain Italian industry appears to be in free fall Poland and the Czech Republic both sitting outside the euro zone are vulnerable too The exception is Hungary where manufacturing is expanding at a healthy pace thanks to battery investment the electric-vehicles boom and long-term energy contracts although some of them will soon come to an endThe second reason for gloom is that consumer spending on services will struggle to hold up the continent economy Buoyed by a strong season in France and the south of Europe as holidaymakers made exuberant use of their pandemic savings tourism added to growth over the summer But sentiment is declining as consumers tighten their belts in preparation for a long cold winter Services are likely to stagnate over the coming months with real estate and transport facing particularly severe difficulties according to s&p Global purchasing managers’ indexLast Europe will almost certainly see the energy shock coincide with rising interest rates Having underestimated price increases along with many other of the world central banks the ecb is now determined to bring annual inflation back to its target of 2% from the alarming 91% recorded in August Isabel Schnabel a member of the bank board argued in favour of inflicting more pain on the economy to see the job through at the Federal Reserve recent gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming Economists therefore expect the ecb to try to buttress its inflation-fighting credentials with a substantial interest-rate rise in its next policy meeting on September 8th possibly lifting rates by three-quarters of a percentage point In expectation yields on European short- and longer-term bonds have increased in the past month Despite this the euro has continued to slump dropping to parity with the dollar for the first time in two decades That reflects a deteriorating outlook for Europe economy and the decision of global investors to turn elsewhere in response It is becoming yet another worry for the continent policymakers as a weaker currency fuels inflation through dearer imports hitting real incomes and thus consumption All this suggests that the European economy is certain to enter a recession led by Germany Italy and central and eastern Europe Analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank expect annualised growth rates of -2% for the euro area overall in the fourth quarter of this year -25% for France and Germany and -3% for Italy Italy troubles and high debts could trigger jitters in Europe bond markets European politicians have so far spent a lot of time thinking about how to respond to surging energy prices They could soon have a broader crisis on their hands For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 30th 2022,Vast corporate profits are delaying an American recession,To the ears of many “pricing power” is something of a dirty term For left-wingers it conjures up images of greedy corporations abusing their market dominance to charge more For economists it raises the spectre of sticky inflation as companies ratchet up prices to cover higher costs But from another perspective pricing power is less of a problem: it enables firms to withstand the kind of inflationary pressures that they are now experiencing In so doing it serves as a shock absorber for the economy forestalling the risk of a recessionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe past few weeks have put pricing power in the spotlight in America According to data published on August 25th post-tax corporate profits reached 121% of gdp in the second quarter their highest since at least the 1940s see chart When companies announced their second-quarter results dozens noted their capacity to raise prices in the face of higher wages and dearer inputs Chipotle a fast-food chain emphasised that it had sold more expensive burritos to its relatively affluent customers The boss of Hilton boasted that having raised room rates sharply in the face of strong demand the hotel chain was set for “the biggest summer” in its century-long history At ibm a tech giant an executive reported that the company was at last “starting to capture the reality” of higher costs in its pricingThe combined effect of all these individual corporate decisions is striking Nearly three-quarters of companies in the s&p 500 America main stock index beat earnings estimates in the second quarter Overall their net profit margins were roughly 12% a touch lower than in the same quarter last year but still above their five-year average of 11% That helps explain the rally in stockmarkets that got going in mid-June It also adds to the evidence that despite all the gloomy talk America economy is in reasonably good shapeand is not in recessionIf there were a compression in margins it would portend a downswing in the business cycle Facing lower profits companies are forced to find ways to cut costs which often include firing workers When sufficient numbers do that it becomes a drag on the rest of the economy Conversely comfortable margins suggest less cost-cutting pressure Thus the corporate results of the past couple of months are squarely on the side of resilienceWhy are companies doing so well? Unsurprisingly energy firms have led the pack benefiting from the surge in oil and gas prices that followed Russia invasion of Ukraine in February Revenues for the s&p 500 including energy companies were up by nearly 14% in the second quarter compared with a year ago Excluding energy companies they were up by 9% according to FactSet a data providerNevertheless even allowing for the outperformance of the energy sector profitability has been impressive Part of the explanation may be that American companies have more market power than a few decades ago bringing greater stability to their earnings Laxer application of anti-monopoly laws over the years as well as the return-to-scale of big-tech platforms help account for that Yet the robustness of profits over the past year is down to something far more basic: the rude health of both consumers’ and companies’ balance-sheets In nominal terms final demand has been well above its pre-pandemic trend fuelled by several rounds of stimulusThe question is how long the good times will last Pessimism is building as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation In July a survey of chief financial officers by ubs a bank found that they were more downbeat about their pricing power over the next 12 to 24 months than they had been in January Some companies are already cutting back their capital-spending plans which could spill over into hiring too But this is all being done from a position of considerable strength Aneta Markowska an economist at Jefferies another bank says the Fed may ultimately be forced to induce a recession to curb inflation but adds that it will have a fight on its hands in part because of the resilience of profit margins “It like a Mike Tyson economy” she explains “It a lot stronger than you think and it going to take a lot of work to take it down” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 30th 2022,Central bankers worry that a new era of high inflation is beginning,In august 2020 Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve described a shift in the central bank policy framework “The economy is always evolving” he noted “Our revised statement reflects our appreciation…that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation” It was a pivot informed by a long period in which prices as often rose by less than the Fed preferred as by more Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTwo years on the Fed faces very different circumstances: rock-bottom unemployment strong wage growth and rates of inflation far above the central bank target On August 26th at an annual jamboree for central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming Mr Powell sang a different tune “Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone” he declared and added that the Fed was prepared to impose economic pain to get inflation back to target Just how much might be required remains anyone guess But the economists and policymakers gathered under the Teton mountains repeatedly voiced a serious concern: that the global forces which in recent decades helped to keep inflation low and stable may be weakeningor reversing To misquote Milton Friedman inflation is often and mostly a monetary phenomenon Central banks have many tools to constrain spending across an economy and thus to prevent demand from outstripping supply in a manner that fuels inflation But they do their work against an evolving economic backdrop which may make taming price pressures easier at some times than at others From the 1980s onwards inflation in the rich world generally fell and became less volatile The phenomenon is commonly attributed to better monetary policy but also to benign global conditions relative to those which confronted central banks in the 1960s and 1970snamely spend-happy governments and energy shockswhen economies were battered by falling productivity growth The world may now “be on the cusp of historic change” as Agustín Carstens of the Bank for International Settlements a club for central banks put it at Jackson Hole Worriers see a few reasons why inflation may stay high Government spending and borrowing patterns seem to have changed for one Across rich and emerging economies public-debt loads have soared over the past two decades As debt burdens rise markets may begin to fear that central banks will eventually have to help finance governments’ obligations say by creating new money to buy bonds That could erode central-bank credibility and raise the public expectations of future inflation The fiscal firepower deployed during the covid-19 pandemic may also reflect governments’ greater openness to using stimulus to fight recession which could likewise cause markets to expect more spending and inflation Work presented at the conference by Francesco Bianchi of Johns Hopkins University and Leonardo Melosi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggests that American inflation stood roughly four percentage points higher than it otherwise would have been thanks to the “fiscal inflation” associated with the $19trn stimulus package passed in 2021 Workers are scarcer too Population growth in the rich world has slowed dramatically owing to demographic change and lower immigration In some economies like America the pandemic was associated with a further drop in labour-force participation From the 1990s to the 2010s global labour supply expanded rapidly as populous economies like China and India became better integrated into the world economy But that experience cannot be repeated and ageing is beginning to hit labour supply in parts of the emerging world as well Workers may thus enjoy more bargaining power in the future spurring wage growth and make life harder for inflation-fighting central banks Then there are slow-burning changes to the structure of the global economy Both emerging and advanced economies engaged in a wave of liberalising reform from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s Tariffs fell while labour and product markets grew more limber These reforms contributed to a surge in global trade large-scale shifts in global production and falling costs across a range of industries Reform may have bolstered productivity growth too which ticked up in advanced economies at the turn of the millennium and in emerging economies in the 2000s But the pace of reform fell and productivity growth ebbed after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 while trade came under sustained pressure from trade wars the pandemic and geopolitical tensions Globalisation served as a “gigantic shock absorber” from the 1980s into the 2010s noted Isabel Schnabel of the European Central Bank such that shifts in demand or supply were easily met through corresponding adjustments to production rather than wild swings in prices Now that flexibility is at risk Nowhere to runFor the attending central bankers this was bracing stuff But it need not be apocalyptic Some trends could make a new macroeconomic era a little easier to bear Demographic change may cut both ways as Gita Gopinath of the imf remarked Though workers in ageing economies may be scarce they will also save more helping mitigate inflationary pressures And as those at the symposium discussed changes spurred by the pandemic may yet yield a productivity dividend Most crucially there is less intellectual confusion today than there was in the 1970s As Mr Powell noted central bankers once needed convincing that they could and should bear responsibility for the level of inflationa situation that allowed high inflation to rage for more than a decade Today by contrast the Fed “responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional” Central bankers are beginning to accept that their task may be harder for years to come That awareness could itself prevent a new era of shocks and volatility from being truly disastrous Read more from Free Exchange our column on

 Aug 28th 2022,The missing pandemic innovation boom,Among the trials and tribulations of the plague years there was a silver lining In late 2020 with the approval of covid-19 vaccines and into 2021 as the jabs worked their magic techno-optimism began to spread If people could develop life-saving inoculations in months why couldn’t the world move out of its low-growth low-productivity slumber? Firms could embrace digitisation as never before; the shift to working from home could allow people free of office gossip and draining commutes to work more effectively; before long there would be vaccines for every disease imaginable Governments promised to spend big on science; companies outlined juicy r&d plans Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt was quite a change of mood In the years before the pandemic the rich world growth rate had drastically slowed In the 2010s American labour productivityoutput per hour of workgrew at half the pace of the decade before Societies had become worse at finding new ideas translating them into innovations and promulgating these innovations Robert Gordon “The Rise and Fall of American Growth” published in 2016 argued that there were fewer life-changing discoveries to be made In early 2020 a paper in the American Economic Review a leading journal made the case that even where there were ideas to be discovered they were getting harder to find The possibility that the dynamic had shifted was intoxicating and not just because it suggested that some good would come of the pandemic Productivity growth is the main driver of higher real wages As the supply side of the economy expanded inflation would become less of a problem And innovations would improve people lives in ways not captured in the economic data But our analysis comes to a depressing conclusion So far there is little sign that the global economy is getting more productiveOfficial statistics are unusually volatile because of lockdown disruptions see chart 1 In the second quarter of 2022 American gdp appeared to fall by 01% even as the number of Americans on payrolls rose by 13m Britain gdp fell by the same amount while employment rose by 150000 Both economies are thus producing less with more people working As a new paper by Mr Gordon of Northwestern University and Hassan Sayed of Princeton notes today weak productivity growth is the flipside of strong growth in 2020 Back then American firms fired their weakest workers boosting productivity Now they are rehiring them dragging it back downData published at higher frequencies support the notion that productivity growth remains poor A global purchasing-managers index pmi compiled by JPMorgan Chase a bank asks bosses about the state of the broader economy and their business A proxy for productivity derived from pmis which we calculate by subtracting the employment component of the index from the output component has in recent months actually fallen We find similar results when applying the same methodology to a real-time indicator of economic activity published by Goldman Sachs another bank see chart 2Why has the productivity boom failed to materialise? Optimists point out that investment spending is indeed roaring as predictedbut caution that the benefits will only be felt slowly There is often a lag of three to five years between higher business investment and productivity growth New research by Jason Draho of ubs another bank concludes that “starting in 2024 the rest of this decade could look more like the second half of the 1990s than the second half of the 1970s” Yet there are three reasons to worry that the pandemic innovation boom might never arriveThe first relates to investment Firms are not necessarily spending on things that lift productivity In recent months with customers facing empty shelves many have scrambled to expand and protect supply chains This improves resilience but by creating redundancy it also increases costs Many firms are also building up inventories or stocks of raw materials and finished goods Such spending counts towards investment as measured in the national accounts but has zero impact on productivity In Germany in late 2021 the build-up of inventories accounted for 9% of total investment the most ever Short-term crisis management has thus taken precedence over long-term innovation In America r&d spending remains high but our back-of-the-envelope calculation for 31 countries suggests that overall rich-world spending on “intellectual-property products” is running at about $3trn a yearbelow its pre-pandemic trend There is not much evidence of a boom in new discoveries and use of frontier technology In 2020 economists talked excitedly about the coming wave of automation as companies invested in AI and machine learning But American imports of robots in real terms are no higher than shortly before the pandemicThe second factor relates to working from home Almost overnight much of the rich world moved from the office to the kitchen table Many have stayed there: a third of paid full days in America are now done from home This is great for work-life balance But predictions that it would also help people work more efficiently which pre-pandemic studies had suggested are as yet unfulfilled A recent survey of economists in America and Europe found that they were “uncertain about the long-term impact on productivity” At home people might be able to focus more on “deep work”; they are also able to spend more time walking the dogIndeed in some instances the pandemic has introduced inefficienciesthe third factor Companies are still spending on extra cleaning and other measures to make people feel safer which will do little to raise profitability With wave after wave of covid workers are taking more sick days In early summer an astonishing 4m Americans said they were off work because they had the disease or were caring for somebody with it according to an official survey In Britain as people moved back to the office last year the share of working hours lost to sickness jumpedPerhaps at some point the rich world will enjoy the long-awaited productivity boom But adjusting for the volatility of the pandemic economy Messrs Gordon and Sayed find “no room for a pandemic-era revival in productivity growth as has been widely suggested” A large body of peer-reviewed evidence before the pandemic established that innovation had drastically slowedand explained the reasons why that was so Wishful thinking is not enough to change that All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 25th 2022,How to avoid energy rationing,Across europe two questions will set the political weather this winter How high will my energy prices go? And what will the government do to protect me? Attempting to shelter from the gathering storm French and Spanish politicians among others have already capped or otherwise lowered gas and electricity prices With wholesale gas futures for early 2023 still climbingup to more than €300 $299 per mwh from less than €30 last summerand Europe economic indicators blinking red more will follow suit That prospect is enough to drive economists to despairListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPoliticians want to protect voters from big bills but also need to cut energy use so as to avoid blackouts and reduce Russia oil-and-gas revenues Price caps help voters but do so inefficiently and reduce the incentive to cut energy use Until recently however economists would have said that their impact on fuel consumption was minor and their impact on gas consumption uncertain A body of research had found that consumers were largely unresponsive to higher petrol prices: they need to drive to work and will do so even if expensive In this analysis capping prices would not make a huge difference to energy consumptionYet a new batch of studies have overturned the conventional view suggesting prices really do matter The difference reflects a change in research methods The earlier generation of studies analysed aggregate data such as weekly sales and prices in a region not demand from individual consumers or even driving patterns This is a problem because crucial information gets lost when aggregating data A mild increase in the weekly average price could hide a drop at the start of the week If that drop encourages more demand an aggregate analysis might find that a higher price leads to more consumption not less And prices at the pump are not set in isolation They respond to demand making the price-demand relationship two-way Disentangling this is trickyMore recent research analysing micro data has produced striking results To assess how consumers react to higher petrol prices Laurence Levin of Visa a payments firm and co-authors looked at daily card transactions from 243 American cities in the late 2000s They found a sizeable response For a 10% rise in petrol prices consumption fell by about 3% They also showed that if they had used aggregate data they would have concluded there had been a much smaller drop Christopher Knittel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Shinsuke Tanaka of Tufts University used even more granular data looking at a Japanese fuel-economy app and found similar results with one extra detail: drivers not only responded to higher prices by driving less they also drove more carefully to save fuel Natural gas like petrol is also an essential good But here too new research finds that consumers cut back when prices are higher Maximilian Auffhammer of the University of California Berkeley and Edward Rubin of the University of Oregon looked at 300m energy bills in California In some parts of the golden state similar households are supplied by two different gas firms which employ different price-adjustment mechanismsproviding the researchers with something akin to the treatment and control groups that are often used in medical research They established that a 10% rise in gas prices led to an average 2% drop in consumption An interesting variation hid behind these figures During summer months there was hardly any response to prices; in winter households cut use by 4%California price changes were small compared with those Europe is facing How households respond to enormous price shocks has rarely been studied owing to a lack of real-world data One exception is that produced by Ukraine which Anna Alberini of the University of Maryland and co-authors have studied looking at price rises in 2015 after subsidies were cut They found that among households that did not invest in better heating or insulation a doubling of prices led to a 16% decline in consumptionPolicies to help households cope with high prices have also been studiedand the results are bad news for politicians capping prices In California where a government programme cut the marginal price of gas for poor households by 20% households raised their consumption by 85% over the next year to 18 months Ukraine has found a better way to help Households struggling to pay their bills can apply for a cash transfer Since such a transfer is unrelated to consumption it preserves the incentive for shorter showers and thus does not blunt the effect of high prices on gas use Another option is a halfway house between a price cap and a transfer An Austrian state recently introduced a discount on the first 80% of a typical household consumption which means people retain an incentive to cut back on anything over thatSpilt milkHouseholds are not the only consumers of gas Early in the war manufacturers and agricultural producers argued against doing anything that might risk supplies since production processes took time to alter and output losses could cascade through the economy But initial evidence from the German dairy and fertiliser industries suggests that even heavy users respond to higher prices Farmers have switched from gas to oil heating; ammonia fertiliser gas-intensive ingredient is now imported instead of being made locally Over time households and industry will adapt more to higher prices meaning that with every passing month demand for gas will fall If Europe politicians are serious about cutting gas use they should heed the latest research and avoid price caps There is even a self-interested case for doing so Without high prices to encourage households and industry to cut back on their energy consumption governments will have to find ways other than the price mechanism to allocate scarce resources Who wants to be the politician to have introduced rationing?

 Aug 24th 2022,Western sanctions will eventually impair Russia economy,When russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th “Oleg” a senior executive at a Russian airline braced for turbulence It did not take long to arrive Within days Western countries had barred his firm aircraft from entering their airspace They also prohibited exports of plane parts and semiconductors to Russia: a problem since three-quarters of the country commercial fleet comes from America Europe or Canada and parts are needed for repairs Many analysts predicted the industry would crash before the summer In fact airlines have managed to rotate their planes to keep viable routes open But they will not be able to defy gravity for ever Some are starting to cannibalise grounded aircraft for parts Oleg expects many planes to be unsafe to fly within a year or two Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe delayed but dangerous descent of Russian aviation illustrates the insidious power of Western sanctions Since February America and its allies have unleashed an unprecedented arsenal to try to squash Russia economy the world 11th largest hoping to stall the war effort prod people and plutocrats to protest and deter other foes namely China from similar escapades Some sanctions such as freezing the assets of Kremlin cronies are old tactics on a new scale Those meant to cut Russia from the financial systemthe exclusion of commercial banks from swift a messaging network and the immobilisation of $300bn in central-bank reservesare novel bazookas A third type comprehensive export bans had previously targeted single firms not an entire country Yet wave after wave of penaltiesthe eu passed its seventh package in Julyhave not razed Fortress Russia Meanwhile as gas prices rocket the sanctions’ political costs are mounting So is the West losing the economic war? Not quite As with the aviation industry it will take time for the damage to materialise Russia a country with low external debt and heaps of foreign-exchange reserves was always unlikely to succumb to a financial heart attack Even when sanctions are most successful such as when they forced Libya to abandon weapons of mass destruction in 2003 past regimes have taken years to work To assess how effective the West arsenal is proving The Economist has ranked a trio of measuresthe freezing of oligarch assets financial sanctions and trade restrictionson a scale from pretty useless to truly hurtful Our analysis suggests that they will in time start to seriously impair Russia economyThe least effective sanctions are those that have won the most publicity: the blacklisting of apparatchiks deemed close to the Kremlin World-Check a data firm reckons that 1455 members of Russia kleptocratic elite are now unable to travel to some or all Western countries or to access their possessions there or both The frozen assets comprise bank deposits and market securities held in escrow accounts at Western banks They also include must-have tycoon toys such as country cottages football clubs jewellery and yachts seized by live-streamed crews of policemen at rivieras around the planet Targeting oligarchs is an attractive approach for governments that need to be seen to be doing something It also gives Russia few direct means of retaliation Western moguls own little there; many American and European firms have already written off their Russian investments Accordingly Western enforcers are seeking greater powers to go after the Fabergé eggs America Department of Justice wants to use anti-mafia laws to liquidate the assets seized and give the proceeds to Ukraine The eu is proposing to make the violation of sanctions a crime which would toughen up enforcement across the bloc Yet most of the assets targeted by the West end up slipping through the net Anders Aslund a former adviser to the Russian and Ukrainian governments reckons that just $50bn out of $400bn of offshore assets that are blocked on paper has so far been frozen Oligarchs have hidden some of their offshore treasures behind as many as 30 layers of shell companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands Jersey and other havens with redacted disclosure documents in multiple languages Others keep a grip on assets they ostensibly no longer control by transferring ownership to kin or placing puppets on the board Missing the boatMeanwhile the enforcement of these sanctions is left to the private custodians of said assets from Swiss wealth managers to marinas in St Tropez which often lack the means or inclination to probe all that deeply Big banks often refuse to move funds on behalf of suspicious entities if they are found to be at least 25% controlled by designated Russians the legal threshold is 50% Yet smaller fintech and crypto firms are less diligent; companies supposed to monitor physical assets such as harbour managers are generally clueless A similar discrepancy exists between jurisdictions America recently scolded Switzerland and the uae where dozens of Russian-owned private jets are grounded in the desert for not doing enough to uncover sanction-evaders It is not clear that freezing such assets does much to hobble Russia economy anyway Most oligarchs hold little political influence A former Ukrainian energy boss reckons that Vladimir Putin Russia president is quite happy to see them taken down a notch Meanwhile efforts to confiscate the assets and send the proceeds to Ukraine have gone nowhereFinancial measures the second type of sanctions target the nerve centres of the Russian economy: commercial lenders and the central bank The former have faced a sliding scale of prohibitions since the invasion depending on their size and proximity to the Kremlin Capital-market sanctions the softest kind bar Western investors from buying or selling bonds or shares issued by 19 Russian banks Ten lenders including the two biggest by assets have been kicked out of swift which more than 11000 banks use globally for cross-border payments Twenty-six can no longer facilitate international transfers in American dollars after Uncle Sam banned its own banks from offering “correspondent-banking” services to them Such measures have bite Research by Stefan Goldbach and colleagues at the Bundesbank shows that between February 1st and April 30th the swift suspensions caused a near-total collapse of money transfers between the excluded Russian banks and the German branch of Target 2 the system for clearing payments between euro-zone banks Alternatives to swift such as telex are clunky and slow Bans on correspondent banking are powerful too Not only is the dollar used directly to settle about 40% of cross-border trade but it also serves as a staging post in many transactions involving second-tier currencies Now Russia must sometimes resort to barter a cumbersome and risky option Yet financial sanctions have failed to choke off most payments Banks that process Europe voluminous purchases of Russian fuel notably Gazprombank are still allowed to use swift Much of the rest is being channelled legally through smaller banks that remain connected to the network Doing without dollars is trickier India which has been guzzling Russian oil since February is still looking for a viable way to pay for it in rupees But a jump in payment volumes going through cips China home-grown swift from May to July suggests China is having more luck Trading volumes in the yuan-rouble pair on the Moscow exchange have reached records of late Freezing the reserves held by the Central Bank of Russia cbr in the West equal to about half of its $600bn-worth total stash has had similarly mixed results Within hours of the measure being announced the rouble value against the greenback which the central bank could no longer defend cratered by more than 30% see chart As the cbr cranked up interest rates to halt the fall from 95% to 20% domestic credit tightened hurting demand and pushing Russia into recession In June the sanctions also forced Russia into its first major foreign-debt default for more than a century after they prevented the central bank from processing $100m in payments due to bondholders Yet it took just a few weeks for the rouble to rebound allowing the cbr to slash rates fast to 8% on July 25th The official exchange rate does not reflect the true appetite for the currency: capital controls first imposed in the wake of the cbr freeze remain largely in place But it still points to a flaw in the West original plan While the cbr foreign stash of dollars and euros remains off-limits Russia earns fresh hard currency every day thanks to its giant oil-and-gas exports This means it does not need to borrow making its default largely inconsequential Which leaves trade restrictions another two-pronged measure Actions to curb Russia oil-export revenues which last year contributed 36% of its federal budget have received more attention than they deserve America no longer imports any Russian oil but it bought little in the first place The eu has pledged to stop buying seaborne crude oil from Russia in December and refined petroleum in February It is already buying a little less: a combined 24m barrels per day bpd in July against 29m before the war Most of those barrels however are being picked up by India and China albeit at a discount of around $25 relative to the price of Brent crude the global benchmark currently at $101 No embargo is planned on Russian gas which is harder to replace and brings in less than 10% of the Kremlin revenueWhether Russia is earning less now than it would without sanctions is debatable Rystad Energy a consultancy reckons it will lose up to $85bn in oil-and-gas tax income this year out of a potential bounty of $295bn because of the discount Then again it is partly the threat of a Western embargo that has kept global oil prices at such high levels Capital Economics another consultancy estimates that Russia has sold its oil at an average price of $85 per barrel since February higher than 90% of the time since 2014 And contrary to early expectations Russia is continuing to export nearly as much petroleum as it has in recent yearsMight that change when the eu import ban comes into force in the next few months? Finding new buyers to mop up the 24m bpd shunned by the bloc will be difficult Moreover from December 31st eu and British insurers which dominate the oil-shipping market will be barred from serving tankers carrying Russian cargo That could prove a big obstacle Many ports and canals may not allow ships through if the risk of oil spills is not covered Reid l’Anson of Kpler a data firm thinks such frictions will force Russia to cut production by 11m bpd by the end of 2022 equivalent to about 14% last year exportsYet there is already talk that Europe will delay its bans if the winter proves too harsh Commodity traders say that at such discounts there will always be buyers China and India may self-insure; Russia has said it will offer reinsurance If its oil exports really do dwindle the market is so tight that prices may jump nullifying the impact America realising this is trying to convince its allies to impose a price cap on Russian oilsomething which could prove hard to implement Shadowy traders in Bahrain or Dubai may cheat to secure bigger volumes Russia may retaliate by withholding oil for a short period provoking a price spike and putting pressure on the West to back downLet the chips fallThe most potent sanctions are in fact the least discussed: export controls In successive salvos since February Western governments have made it compulsory for a range of domestic industries to seek licences before selling to Russia and they are rarely granted The restrictions go well beyond “dual-use” productsthose with both military and commercial applications like drones and lasersto cover advanced kit such as chips computers software and energy equipment They also target low-tech goods such as chemicals and commodities that are usually restricted only if set for Iran or North Korea The breadth of such sanctions is remarkable What makes America particularly vicious however is the “Foreign Direct Product Rule” fdpr which extends the controls not just to products made in the United States but also to foreign ones made using American software and tools or containing American inputs When America pioneered the fdpr in 2020 to prevent Huawei a Chinese telecoms giant it suspected of spying from acquiring advanced semiconductors it hammered the firm even though plants in America account for just 15% of global chipmaking capacity This time America claims that global chip exports to Russia are down 90% from last yearThat is bad news for the country manufacturing sector which needs imported inputs Mr Putin has worked hard since 2014 to insulate Russia financial system against Western sanctionsby de-dollarising its trade diversifying its central-bank reserves and developing home-grown payment networksbut the same is not true of the country industry which up until the war began remained woven into the global trading order even if less so than other countries Chips and other electronic components from 70 different American and European firms have been found in Russian weaponry Other industries from mining to transport require foreign parts and expertise to carry out maintenance A German supplier to the Moscow metro reckons that if it stopped providing servicing the network would see disruptions within a month and be paralysed after three Russia also needs nifty software and hardware to develop new products from consumer electronics to electric cars Some effects are already visible even though export controls kicked in late most had a one-to-three-month grace period Manufacturing output fell by 7% between December and June led by carmaking a 90% fall pharma 25% and electrical equipment 15% In May Russia eased safety standards to allow for the production of cars without airbags and anti-lock brakes A lack of high-tech kit has hampered Russia 5g roll-out The country cloud-computing champions such as Yandex an internet firm and Sberbank a lender are struggling to expand data centres The chip shortage is hindering new plastic-card issuance on mir the domestic payment system A lack of specialised vessels may hobble Russia Arctic drilling plans; a dearth of foreign technology and know-how could even slow down old-school oil-and-gas extraction Basic industries such as the mining and refining of metals have slumped too Russia is trying to fight back Previously it tapped the unauthorised grey market to source sensitive Western tech and military kit often from resellers in Asia and Africa In June it went further by legalising “parallel” imports allowing Russian firms to bring in goods such as servers and phones without the trademark holder consent Artem Starosiek of Molfar a Ukrainian intelligence firm says there has been a boom in “credit-card tourism” as tour operators that once organised covid-vaccine trips for Russians now fly them to buy Visa-issued cards in Uzbekistan Trade between Western countries and Russia neighbours such as Georgia and Kazakhstan has grown rapidly since the invasion Yet it is hard for an entire economy to be run on smuggled goods especially when some of them are scarce everywhere Chinese firms which usually supply a quarter of Russia imports have been slow to help since they too fear losing access to essential Western parts Even Huawei has curtailed its links with Russia The shortages will therefore last with their effects compounding over time as wear and tear takes its toll and the rot spreads from one industry to the next The result will be a slow grinding degradation of Russia economyThis degradation will be compounded by the sanctions’ less tangible effects Konstantin Sonin of the University of Chicago reckons several hundreds of thousands of Russiansmany of them highly skilledhave left the country since the invasion More than 1200 foreign firms have also pledged to leave according to scholars at Yale University The imf forecasts that the country growth rate in 2025-26 will have fallen by roughly half compared with estimates from before the outbreak of war So long as America and its allies maintain their sanctions Russia industrial backbone intellectual brawn and international links will fade and its future will be one of sagging productivity little innovation and structural inflation Economists were wrong to predict an instant crash What Russia is getting instead is a one-way ticket to nowhere Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

others are shifting assets out of the country In the first quarter of 2022 the latest available data foreigners pulled out $15bn-worth of direct investment easily the worst figure on record In May 2022 Russian remittances to Georgia were an astonishing ten times higher in dollar terms than the year before But The Economist analysis of data from a wide variety of sources suggests that Russia economy is doing better than even the most upbeat forecasts predicted as sales of hydrocarbons have fuelled a record current-account surplus Take for example a “current-activity indicator” published by Goldman Sachs a bank a real-time measure of economic growth see chart 1 This declined dramatically in March and April if not on a scale comparable with the global financial crisis of 2007-09 or even the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 In subsequent months it has recoveredOther measures tell a similar story: of a recession but not a deep one at least by Russia volatile standards see chart 2 In June industrial production was 18% down on a year earlier according to a paper published by JPMorgan Chase another bank An index of service-sector growth compiled by sending surveys to managers shows a smaller hit than during previous crises Electricity consumption seems to be growing again after an initial decline The number of railway loadings a proxy for goods demand is holding up Meanwhile inflation is easing From the start of 2022 to the end of May consumer prices rose by about 10% The fall in the rouble made imports dearer; the withdrawal of Western companies cut supply But prices are now falling according to Rosstat An independent source published by State Street Global Markets a consultancy and PriceStats a data firm derived from online prices shows similar trends In its public statements the cbr now worries about falling prices as well as inflation A stronger rouble has cut the cost of imports And Russians’ inflation expectations have fallen A data set from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University shows expected inflation over the next year has dropped from 176% in March to 11% in July see chart 3 With plentiful gas Russia is also unlikely to see a European-style surge in inflation produced by higher energy pricesFalling prices are not the only thing helping households True the unemployment rate at an all-time low of 39% in June is misleading Many companies have furloughed staff some without pay in order to avoid registering redundancies But there is not much evidence of a jobs calamity Data from HeadHunter a Russian jobs site suggest that the economy-wide ratio of jobseekers to vacancies rose from 38 in January to 59 in Maymaking it harder to find a job than beforeand then fell back a bit Data from Sberbank Russia largest lender indicate that median real wages have sharply increased since the spring In part because the labour market is holding up people can keep spending Sberbank data suggest that in July real consumer spending was pretty much unchanged from the start of the year Imports fell in the spring partly because many Western firms stopped supplying them Yet the decline was not severe by the standards of recent recessions and imports are now bouncing back fast see chart 4Three factors explain why Russia keeps beating the forecasts The first is policy Vladimir Putin has little understanding of economics but he is happy to delegate economic management to people who do The cbr is stuffed with highly qualified wonks who took swift action to prevent economic collapse The doubling of interest rates in February in combination with capital controls shored up the rouble helping to cut inflation The general public know that Elvira Nabiullina the bank governor is serious about keeping a lid on prices even if this does not make her a popular figureThe second factor relates to recent economic history Sergei Shoigu Russia defence minister may have been on to something in February when according to the Washington Post he told the British government that Russians “can suffer like no one else” This is the fifth economic crisis the country has faced in 25 years after 1998 2008 2014 and 2020 Anyone older than 40 has memories of the extraordinary economic tumult brought about by the fall of the Soviet Union People have learned to adapt rather than panic or revolt Parts of Russia economy have long been fairly detached from the West That comes at the cost of lower growth but it has made the recent increase in isolation less painful In 2019 the stock of foreign direct investment in the country was worth about 30% of gdp compared with the global average of 49% Before the invasion only about 03% of Russians with a job worked for an American firm compared with more than 2% across the rich world The country requires relatively few foreign supplies of raw materials Thus the extra isolation has not had much of an impact on the figures to dateThe third factor relates to hydrocarbons Sanctions have had a limited impact on Russian oil output according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency Since the invasion Russia has sold in the region of $85bn-worth of fossil fuels to the eu The way in which Russia spends the foreign currency thus accumulated is something of a mystery given sanctions on the government There is little doubt though that these sales are helping Russia to continue to buy importsnot to mention pay soldiers and buy weaponsUntil Mr Putin leaves office Western investors will be reluctant to touch Russia Sanctions will remain The cbr acknowledges that while Russia does not rely much on foreign materials it is desperate for foreign machinery Over time sanctions will take a toll and Russia will produce goods of a worse quality at a higher cost But for now its economy is stumbling along Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

 Aug 18th 2022,Does unemployment really have to rise to bring down inflation?,Rarely in america past has an inflation rate of 85% felt so good In July for the first time since May 2020 consumer prices did not rise from one month to the nextthough the year-on-year rate of increase remained highthanks to a sharp drop in energy prices But officials at the Federal Reserve are not celebrating From their perspective the inflation problem remains unresolved as long as rapid growth in workers’ wages continues to power a spending boom While that remains the case a drop in the price of any one thing such as oil only leaves more room for spending on another The Fed thus needs to weaken workers’ bargaining positions by introducing a bit of slack into the labour market Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet what counts as slack is very much up for debate In its broad outlines the concept is clear enough It represents a supply of workers in excess of labour demand: too many people chasing too little employment Under such conditions firms do not need to work very hard to lure or retain workers and pay packets thus grow slowly if at all At present there does not seem to be much slack about In the three months to July the hourly wage of the typical American worker rose at an annual rate of almost 7%nearly double the fastest pace reached in the 2010s This rather than dear oil or soaring rents is what most troubles the Fed and what it seeks to address through higher interest ratesEconomists disagree however about how much give must be introduced into labour markets and where Much of the recent argument has focused on the level of job openings relative to the number of unemployed workers a ratio that has been near its record high for most of the past year Given that many firms are scrapping to hire from a tiny pool of available workers it comes as little surprise that wage offers are rocketing Yet some Fed officials argue that precisely because the number of job vacancies is so high it may be possible to introduce slack into the labour market through reductions in the number of posted openingswithout having to push millions of people out of work In July Chris Waller a Federal Reserve governor and Andrew Figura also of the Fed published a paper making this case noting that the relationship between vacancies and unemployment may at current levels be a very steep one such that tapping the monetary brakes yields a little extra unemployment but a big drop in openings which hampers workers’ ability to move to higher-paying jobs Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has also expressed similar viewsOther economists are unconvinced A recent analysis published by Alex Domash and Larry Summers of Harvard University and Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank noted that there has never before been a large drop in the number of job openings that has not coincided with a meaningful rise in unemployment This makes sense: conditions that deter some firms from advertising for new workers may well lead other employers to lay off staff But given that vacancies are in uncharted territory it is hard to know whether such historical rules of thumb apply And since March at least the number of job openings in America has fallen by nearly 10% even as the unemployment rate droppedThere are other places apart from the balance between job openings and unemployment to look for more slack An increase in labour supply either through increases in average hours worked or through the entrance of more people into the workforce could have the effect of bringing down wage growth without unemployment having to go up In a new paper David Blanchflower and Jackson Spurling of Dartmouth College and Alex Bryson of University College London suggest that in the years since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 these potential sources of labour supply have been more important in shaping wage growth than either the level of unemployment or the number of job vacancies At present American data for both hours worked and labour-force participation seem to show room for improvement The number of average hours worked per employee is at roughly the level of the mid-2010s and has actually fallen since the beginning of this year; it could easily go higher Perhaps more important rates of labour-force participation remain subdued Indeed among “prime-age” adults those 25-54-years-old the share of the population now working is currently a little lower than it was immediately before the covid-19 pandemic and nearly two percentage points lower than the peak reached in 2000 There are seemingly more hours that could be worked by more peoplea situation that certainly seems to meet the definition of slackDroops to conquerYet a lot hangs on whether those who left the workforce during the worst of the pandemic decide to return Some people for instance may have retired permanently Others might be enticed back in by heady wage growth and could eventually add to slack Research published last year by Bart Hobijn of Arizona State University and Aysegul Sahin of the University of Texas finds that participation tends to keep rising several months after the unemployment rate hits a bottom which it is yet to do If such a rise were to coincide with falling vacancies wage growth could be checked without unemployment going up Indeed in the late 2010s pay stagnated amid an improving economy and falling unemployment thanks to precisely this confluence of events Yet a pessimist might point out that if anything America labour-force participation has been falling in recent months rather than rising So far at least rapid wage growth has not proved to be very tempting Moreover having allowed inflation to get so far out of hand the Fed may now feel bound to push unemployment up rather than hoping for the emergence of less certain forms of slack It may in other words be unwilling to cut optimistic interpretations any slack Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:America v Europe: A comparison of riches leaves both sides red-faced Aug 13thHow high property prices can damage the economy Jul 30thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 17th 2022,Can the Visa-Mastercard duopoly be broken?,“It like vegas” says Matt Moore the owner of a small bike shop in Georgetown a neighbourhood in Washington “You know you’re going to get screwed the only question is how to get screwed the least” The system of interchangewhereby banks and credit-card issuers charge merchants for collecting paymentsis loathed by many retailers Merchants hand over $138bn in fees each year; according to the National Retail Federation a lobby group it is their second-biggest cost after wages And while shoppers are less likely to have strong feelings about the system being mostly unaware of it they also suffer as a result of higher sticker prices Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAmerica is home to the heftiest interchange fees of any major economycosts are an order of magnitude greater than in Europe and China That largely benefits two firms: Visa and Mastercard which facilitate more than three-quarters of the country credit-card transactions Doing so has made them two of the most profitable companies in the world with net margins last year of 51% and 46% respectively Rank every firm excluding real-estate-investment trusts in the s&p 500 index by their average net-profit margins last year five years ago and a decade ago and only four appear in the top 20 every time Two are financial-information firms Intercontinental Exchange and the cme Group The others are Mastercard and Visa At first glance their position appears insurmountable Already dominant in recent years the firms have been boosted by a covid-induced rise in online shopping American consumers used credit or debit cards for 45% of their transactions in 2016; by 2021 that had reached 57% The migration from cash is “a significant and long-running tailwind” says Craig Vosburg of Mastercard Yet two threats loom The first comes from Washington where legislators hope to smash the duo grip on payments The second is virtual Payments have been transformed in Brazil China and Indonesia by cheap convenient app-based options from tech giants like Mercado Pago Ant Group Tencent and Grab After a long wait new entrants now look like they could shake up America marketThat would be good news for consumers and retailers Much of Visa and Mastercard profits are ultimately driven by the fees that are charged when a shopper uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase The eu has capped such fees for credit cards at 03% of the transaction value; intense competition in China means that WeChat and Alipay collect charges of just 01% In America debit cards are regulated by the “Durbin amendment” which gives the Federal Reserve the authority to enforce a cap But credit-card fees are unregulated and meatier usually sitting at about 2% of the transaction and rising to 35% for some premium-reward cards These fees are set by Mastercard and Visa but collected by banks which take a slice and use them to fund perks such as insurance and air miles to entice customers For the right to use the card networks’ transaction-processing services banks hand over enormous fees The result is that consumers pay through the nose for their perks while remaining largely oblivious According to a paper published last year by Joanna Stavins of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and colleagues retailers raise prices at the tills by 14% passing interchange costs on to households Poor Americans fare the worst High fees are built into the price of goods and prices are typically the same whether you pay with card or cash which the poor are more likely to use “The way to think about it is if you are not getting your points you are essentially funding everyone else” says Brian Kelly more commonly known as “the points guy” who has forged an entire business out of encouraging people to use perks Households with an annual income of less than $25000 roughly a quarter of the total number on average get no net rewards since any they do receive are entirely offset by fees Households that bring in more than $135000 a year recoup in points or perks around 06 percentage points of the interchange fees they pay These fees do fund some benefits not least the sort of consumer protection that is provided by regulators or legislators elsewhere In Europe for instance regulation ensures that customers can return goods especially faulty ones or that airlines compensate delayed passengers In America card networks have stepped into the breach They offer consumers the ability to “charge-back”reverse their approval for a settled transactionif something is not delivered as described Card networks also use the fees to keep payment systems secure and free from fraud In short Americans rely more on capitalism and competition to protect consumers rather than legislation and regulation“I certainly would not eliminate credit cards because they work great they are convenient and people love them” says Ms Stavins Instead she would like costs to be passed on: “If you come to the checkout and you want to use a credit card you would pay $103 for a $100 item” That way consumers would pay for the benefits but only if they truly value them Such a solution used to be impossible: in their agreements with merchants the card networks explicitly banned the addition of such surcharges But a class-action lawsuit that was first settled in 2013 forced Visa and Mastercard to permit merchants to impose a surcharge Subsequent lawsuits have overturned state laws banning surcharges Even though adding surcharges is now permitted and legal it is still difficult “When we talk to merchants a lot of them do not even know whether it is a plain card or a reward card so they do not know what their processing cost is until they get their monthly bill” says Ms Stavins It would be a technological nightmare to implement a system that accounted for all the different interchange rates It would also be off-putting for customers Typically businesses that do surcharge are those such as petrol stations or government enterprises where consumers struggle to go elsewhereThat might explain why legislators are eyeing up credit cards On July 28th Richard Durbin the same Democratic senator who regulated debit interchange a decade ago introduced the Credit Card Competition Act ccc It does not propose a cap on interchange as the debit rule does since costs for credit cards are more variable than for debit cards making it harder to find the right level Instead the ccc would attempt to spur competition by breaking the links between card networks and banks At present when a bank issues a credit card every transaction on it is processed by the card network the bank stipulates meaning the bank is guaranteed the interchange fee the network sets If the ccc becomes law it will force banks to offer merchants the choice of at least two different card networks Crucially these choices could not be the two biggestat least one smaller network would have to be offered They could compete for business by offering lower interchange rates and merchants would presumably jump at the offer The credit-card firms defend the existing system arguing that consumers and merchants derive value from it because it helps guarantee payments for merchants and protect consumers against fraud Thus shoppers have more purchasing power than would otherwise have been the case Two factors help the bill chances It is sponsored by Mr Durbin the second-most senior Democrat in the Senate and it is bipartisan co-sponsored by Roger Marshall a Republican from Kansas The ccc best chance is probably as an amendment to another bigger piece of legislation which is how debit-card regulation passed in 2010 Even if the effort fails or fails to work as intended a potentially bigger threat to the giants looms So far new entrants to the payments market have benefited Visa and Mastercard by making it easier for consumers to use their cards online But as the new fintechs have gained clout their decisions about the sorts of payments they offer could influence how much money travels along the card networks Stripe a large payments-infrastructure firm says it is working to provide merchants with payment methods that will lower their costs Current options include a box for customers to enter card details but also Klarna a “buy-now-pay-later” provider through which customers can pay for purchases using bank transfers thus avoiding the card networks It could soon include things like FedNow a real-time bank-transfer system being built by the Fed which is due to be launched next year In time it could even include central-bank digital currencies or cryptocurrencies Competitors might make little headway if the perks for sticking with credit cards are sufficiently juicy But merchants can offer their own incentives When your correspondent recently went to purchase a pair of linen trousers from Everlane an online retailer she was encouraged to pay using Catch a fintech app The app linked to her bank account via another payment startup called Plaid As a thank you for avoiding the card networks Everlane offered a shop credit worth 5% of the transaction value Catch has signed up a handful of fashionable millennial brands including Pacsun another clothing retailer and Farmacy a skincare firm For evidence that this poses a threat look no further than Visa attempted purchase of Plaid In 2020 the firm tried to buy the upstart for $53bn only for the deal to be scuppered by antitrust regulators on the grounds that the transaction would have allowed Visa to eliminate a competitive threat

 Aug 16th 2022,Xi Jinping economic revolution aims to spread growth,To get a cup of milk tea from Chayan Yuese in the central Chinese city of Changsha you may have to queue for an hour in the sweltering heat The local company known in English as “Sexy Tea” has become a national sensation Patrons insist that its method of steeping tea leaves and its ratio of water to milk produce a mellow brew that helps wash down fiery pepper-laden local dishes Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is part of what has made Changsha a wanghong hotspot or a place where young people come to shoot videos for social media Street vendors serving up spicy crayfish have become internet celebrities Crowds throng the city central shopping districts and eateries into the early hours of the morning despite worries about covid-19 The local television station has become something akin to the Netflix of China Chinese social media teems with photographs of young women dressed in swanky outfits posing in front of the city 32-metre-high granite bust of Mao Zedong the country revolutionary leader who came from a nearby townChina recent development has concentrated wealth in eastern cities Now President Xi Jinping wants to spread it inland to places like Changsha and wants the process to be driven by innovation in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence ai cloud computing and smart manufacturing“industrialisation 40” in his words Central-government directives often seem far removed from real business activity They are filled with lofty slogans and long-winded references to the importance of “Xi Jinping Thought” Changsha offers a snapshot of how Mr Xi revolution is actually playing outThe city is one of 15 urban centres that is trying to make the leap into the country elite Together they are known as “new first-tier” cities and already account for about a fifth of China gdp In Changsha the local government is happy to have a wanghong economy: planners want to make the city a centre for culture and tourism that brings in 500bn yuan $74bn in revenues a year up from less than 200bn in 2021 They hope fashionable tea shops will also help with a much bigger challenge and the main focus of their growth strategy: upgrading the city industrial base That will mean attracting a horde of new companies and talented people to a region hundreds of kilometres from wealthy coastal areas Changsha strong but old-fashioned industrial base makes it typical of the new first tier: industry drove rapid growth in the early 2000s but in the years since Changsha performance has converged with the Chinese average see chart The city is home to China two largest construction-machinery firms Sany and Zoomlion Another firm bsb is one of the country biggest specialists in prefabricated construction In a city just south of Changsha is one of the main manufacturing hubs of crrc China state-owned rail outfit These distinct specialties mean it should not have to compete head-on with neighbouring cities such as Chengdu which has a big aircraft-manufacturing base says Wang Tao of ubs a bank and a native of ChangshaThe first challenge planners face is upgrading the city existing industry through digitisation and automation The government has handed out large subsidies to encourage internet-technology companies to cluster around existing machinery building and transport firms Thousands of automation-related firms have been set up as a result Officials are monitoring what happens next One recent reform in industrial parks measures the amount of tax companies pay per mu 006 hectares of land they occupy and will eventually push out low payersIndustrial upgrades often involve integrating brand-new systems5g internet or ai-powered logisticsinto legacy firms in order to help boost efficiency note analysts at Jefferies an investment bank Baosight a state-owned industrial-digitisation giant has helped do this at many steel plants These sorts of changes can take years and require large experienced technology providers But most of the companies working in Changsha are small The city is not home to any large tech firms which are mainly based in China eastern cities Even some neighbouring industrial hubs such as Chongqing and Chengdu score better on this front This ultimately means the pace of industrial digitisation will be slower in Changsha says Xu Dihong the founder of Cadstar a local industrial-software companyThe second challenge is to hasten a boom in new tech companies Like several neighbouring cities Changsha is hurrying to build ai and smart-manufacturing parks; last year the Ministry of Science and Technology announced that it would build a national ai innovation zone in the city Some 5180 firms claiming to offer ai-related services were set up in Changsha in the first seven months of 2022 up from about 3000 in all of 2021 according to Qichacha a corporate-intelligence firm The trend has been mirrored across inland Chinese cities Whether this reflects genuine tech entrepreneurialism is doubtful; experts believe many of the new ai firms do little in the way of real innovationA burgeoning tech hub also needs a steady supply of talent In April the local government announced a list of 45 measures aimed at coaxing young professionals to the city including grants of up to 100m yuan for top scientists and tech organisations The cheapness of the city wanghong lifestyle is another draw Changsha has some of the lowest house prices of any large city in the country making it especially attractive to young entrepreneurs “A family can get twice the space in a flat here compared with a coastal city” says Mr Xu The milk tea and late-night dining on crayfish do not hurt either Yet they may not be enough Wang Peng of Huijiang Automation Technology a tech firm that set up an office in Changsha last year says that despite the generous incentives it is still hard to hire the right people Even established tech hubs such as Suzhou and Shenzhen face shortages of talented staff The city also has few international links Its location deep in China interior has made it difficult to bring in the highest level of talent especially Chinese people returning from university or work abroad says a professor at a local university It is a problem that could prevent many of the new first-tier cities making the leap to the very top For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Aug 11th 2022,America v Europe: A comparison of riches leaves both sides red-faced,When david hockney mother visited the British artist in Los Angeles she made an observation that points to the difficulties with transatlantic economic comparisons “Strange” she said after a couple of days in the sun “all this lovely weather and you never see any washing out” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is an observation many European visitors have echoed American travellers to Europe meanwhile often despair at washer-dryer machines that leave clothes damp Indeed for some American writers the lack of standalone dryers is symbolic of the continent backwardness While economic statistics should solve such debatesby allowing for apples-to-apples comparisonsthey are not immune to the problems posed by cultural differences Is it that Europeans cannot afford proper tumble dryers? Or are they simply getting their “drying services” free of charge?Questions like these are important when comparing countries On the surface America has by far the best case for prosperity Gross domestic product gdp per person is almost $70000 The only European countries where it is higher are Luxembourg Switzerland Norway and Ireland where figures are distorted by firms’ profit shifting In Germany Europe economic powerhouse gdp per person adjusted for purchasing-power parity is $58000 That puts it level with Vermont but far below New York $93000 and California $86000 The comparisons are even less flattering for other European countries Incomes in Britain and France are equal to those in Mississippi $42000 America poorest state Yet a lot is hidden by these figures To understand why consider how they are calculated Spending is deflated by some measure of price to allow accurate comparisons between countries of the amount of goods and services purchased For manufactured goods this is a straightforward calculation: the amount Americans spend on dryers divided by an index of their cost will give a pretty accurate figure for total consumptionFor services it is harder to work out a reasonable deflator And that matters because it is here rather than household appliances where Europe and America differ most Combined spending on health care housing and finance accounts for about half the difference in consumption between America and the biggest European economies In 2019 Americans consumed $12000-worth of health services per person; Germans managed just $7000The difficulty in working out a reasonable deflator is partly conceptual What are people paying for when they buy health care a service or an outcome? Is a unit of “health-care services” the cost of a specific treatment or the cost of health? What does being healthy even mean? International price indices simply and a little unsatisfactorily calculate the price per treatment These differ substantially The oecd a club of mostly rich countries estimates that a hip replacement in Norway costs seven times as much as one in Latvia and Lithuania In any case while American prices are higher than European ones the gap is not big enough to account for the difference in health-care consumption: Americans also undergo lots more medical treatmentSimon Kuznets a Nobel-prize-winning economist and statistician suggested estimates of gdp should exclude things an “enlightened social philosophy” would consider harms rather than benefits For him that included weapons advertising much of finance and anything necessary to “overcome difficulties that are properly speaking costs implicit in our economic civilisation”Many Europeans would suggest this category rightfully includes American health-care spending Life expectancy in America is five years lower than in Italy; lots of money is spent fixing the damage done by higher levels of violent crime traffic accidents and obesity Follow Kuznets adviceby removing from the calculation finance health public administration and defence spendingand the gap between America and Germany in gdp per hour worked drops from $11 to just $4 Much of the remaining gap is accounted for by “housing services” a category of consumption similarly bedevilled by conceptual difficulties International comparisons are done on the basis of the rental cost per square metre That flatters sparsely populated America and its sprawling cities where rents are generally cheaper While nearly everyone would rather have a bigger house preferences for suburban over urban living are hardly universalTop dollarThere are diminishing returns to America spending on health care But treating all of it as an additional cost would be a mistake Cancer survival rates are higher in America than Europe Health-care spending can be considered a luxury good that a richer country may choose to spend more on Germany Norway and Switzerland spend the most in Europe Meanwhile as American defence hawks like to point out Europe low military spending is possible only thanks to America largesse and the security it provides America has other genuine advantages The combination of higher productivity and the fact that workers spend more time at work allows Americans to enjoy greater quantities of consumer electronics cars furniture and clothes The only categories in which Germans and the French consistently consume more are education spending abroad and food and drink suggesting there is something to stereotypes of Europe cosmopolitan café culture and America infatuation with consumer goods Still while arguments can be made for Europe there is no way of slicing the data despite your columnist best efforts to make the continent biggest economies richer than America Even in the areas where Europe does consume more than America the old-world economies are not ahead by much Maybe the true lesson of the comparison is that neither side ought to be satisfied: Europeans should be unhappy with their lower incomes; Americans really should be getting a lot more from their riches Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 30thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 11th 2022,How should investors prepare for repeat inflation shocks?,Buy stocks so you can dream buy bonds so you can sleepor so the saying goes A wise investor will aim to maximise their returns relative to risk defined as volatility in the rate of return and therefore hold some investments that will do well in good times and some in bad Stocks surge when the economy soars; bonds climb during a crisis A mix of the twooften 60% stocks and 40% bondsshould help investors earn a nice return without too much risk Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSuch a mix has been a sensible strategy for much of the past two decades Since 2000 the average correlation between American stocks and Treasuries has been staunchly negative at -05 But the recent rout in both stock and bond prices has wrong-footed investors In the first half of the year the s&p 500 shed 206% and an aggregate measure of the price of Treasuries lost 86% Is this an aberration or the new normal?The answer depends on whether higher inflation is here to stay When economic growth drives asset prices stocks and bonds diverge When inflation drives them stocks and bonds often move in tandem On August 10th American inflation data showed prices did not rise in July Stocks soaredthe s&p 500 rose by 21%and short-term Treasury prices climbed too For as long as central bankers kept a lid on inflation investors were protected Yet look back before 2000 to a period when inflation was more common and you see that stocks and bonds frequently moved in the same direction aqr Capital Management an investment firm notes that in the 20th century the correlation between stocks and bonds was more often positive than negativeLots of hedge-fund types pension-fund managers and private-equity barons are therefore worrying about the potential for repeat inflation shocks Last year the debate in the halls of finance was about whether inflation would be “transitory” or “persistent”; this year it is about whether it is “cyclical” or “structural”At the heart of this is not whether central bankers can bring down prices but whether the underlying inflation dynamic has changed Those in the “structural” camp argue that the recent period of low inflation was an accident of historyhelped by relatively calm energy markets globalisation and Chinese demographics which pushed down goods prices by lowering the cost of labour These tailwinds have turned Covid-19 messed up supply chains; war and sabre-rattling are undermining globalisation Manoj Pradhan formerly of Morgan Stanley points out that China working-age population has peaked Jeremy Grantham a bearish hedge-fund investor fears that the switch to renewables will be slow and costly and that lower investment in fossil-fuel production will make it hard for energy firms to ramp up supply increasing the risk of energy-price spikes All this the structuralists argue means the current inflation shock is likely to be the first of many: central bankers will be playing whack-a-mole for a while yet Recurrent inflation would upend 20 years of portfolio-management strategy If the correlation between stocks and bonds shifts from -05 to +05 the volatility of a “60/40” portfolio increases by around 20% In a bid to avoid being wrong-footed once again investors are updating their plans As Barry Gill of ubs asset-management arm puts it the task is “to realign your portfolio around this new reality” What assets will allow investors to sleep soundly in this new reality? Cryptocurrencies once looked like an interesting hedge but this year they have fallen and risen in lockstep with stocks A recent paper by kkr a private asset-management firm argues perhaps unsurprisingly that illiquid alternatives like private equity and credit are a good way to diversify But that may be an illusion: illiquid assets are rarely marked-to-market and are exposed to the same underlying economic forces as stocks and bonds There are other options aqr suggests stock-picking strategies where success has little to do with broader economic conditions such as “long-short” equity investing going long on one firm and short on another Meanwhile commodities are the natural choice for those worried about a disorderly green transition since a basket of them appears to be uncorrelated with stocks and bonds over long periods In the search for new ways to minimise risk investors dreaming of high returns will have to get creative That at least should tire them out by the end of the dayRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Reminiscences of a financial columnist Jul 28th The Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdWhy markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 9th 2022,China mortgage boycotts are a symptom of a broader crisis,The german mathematician David Hilbert once imagined a hotel with an infinite number of rooms Even if all of the rooms were occupied he pointed out the hotel could accommodate a new arrival simply by asking each guest to move into the room next door One guest would move into a second guest room freeing up a spot for the new arrival The second guest would move into a third guest room and so on With an infinite number of rooms the sequence would never endListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor years China property developers operated along similar lines They would sell flats far in advance of building them The money raised for these flats was supposedly reserved for building them just as each room in Hilbert hotel was supposedly reserved for an existing guest But developers would instead use the money for other purposes such as buying land When the time came to pay for construction they would sell more unbuilt flats and use that money instead Just as Hilbert hotel accommodated each guest in the room next door China property developers built each pre-sold flat with the money from the next pre-sale As long as there were always new buyers the sequence could go onUnfortunately China developers are now running out of rooms Their sales in the 12 months to June fell by 22% compared with the previous 12 months Advance sales fell even faster see chart This painful brush with finitude has left many developers without enough cash to continue building the flats their customers have already bought China developers have started work on over 6bn square metres of property in the past three years They have completed less than half that amount In the past homebuyers could do little about these delays They had already handed over their money after allBut although they have paid their developers they are still paying their banks In recent months angry homebuyers have threatened to stop repaying their mortgages if developers do not resume work on their flats According to a crowdsourced document circulating online this mortgage strike has spread to nearly 100 cities and over 320 projects including a Dragon City a Peacock City and a Phoenix City Over 40 of these projects are in Zhengzhou the capital of Henan provinceHow widespread could boycotts become? There are some limits to their growth Striking mortgage-holders could end up on credit blacklists damaging their access to loans And in China points out s&p Global a ratings agency most individuals cannot declare bankruptcy since “their debts will never be forgiven”In a gloomy scenario mortgage loans worth about 24trn yuan $350bn could turn sour reckons s&p Global That amounts to roughly 13% of total bank loans enough to endanger some smaller lenders but not enough to pose a systemic threat to the banking systemThe true significance of the boycotts lies elsewhere They show that Chinese households no longer believe that a flat bought in advance will necessarily be delivered This loss of faith is not confined to the protesters It is also showing up in weakening pre-sales especially for distressed developers A reluctance to buy new homes poses a bigger threat to China economy than the more conspicuous refusal to repay existing mortgages Weak sales will further squeeze the revenues of developers adding to construction delays and deepening disillusionmentHow can this vicious circle be broken? In Henan two state-owned enterprises a developer and a “bad bank” have set up a relief fund to acquire distressed projects and see them through to completion But China local governments lack the cash to revive confidence according to Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics a research firm He believes a credible plan will require the central government to step in It is understandably reluctant to plough more resources into a sector that already commands too big a share of the economy But new money invested in stalled projects could yield a double dividend helping both to build unfinished flats and to rebuild confidence in pre-salesIn the longer term China developers need a less frenetic business model They will have to rely less on selling flats in advance and starting the next project before finishing the last In China the demand for housing is vast But it is not infinite For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 7th 2022,An oil windfall offers Gulf states one last chance to splurge,In the north-western corner of Saudi Arabia not far from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba sits a patch of mostly bare desertthe ostensible location of Neom This would-be city is intended to be a bold step into the future and the showpiece of the kingdom attempt to diversify its economy away from oil There has been talk of robots doing menial work beaches lined with crushed marble and fleets of drones forming an artificial moon One recent whim is to create the world longest buildings; like skyscrapers laid flat these self-contained ecosystems would stretch for more than 100 miles Estimates suggest the city could cost as much as $500bnListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen this wild dream was first unveiled in 2017 financing it seemed near impossible Now a torrent of oil money may allow Saudi Arabia to get things rolling The world economy recovery from covid-19 and Russia invasion of Ukraine have pushed up oil prices triggering a staggering transfer of wealth from global consumers to fuel-exporting countries From January to June the price of a barrel of Brent crude rose from $80 to more than $120 it is back below $100 today The imf estimates that energy exporters in the Middle East and Central Asia will this year net $320bn more in oil revenues than it had previously expected a figure equivalent to about 7% of their combined gdp Over the next five years the cumulative surplus could reach $14trn Gulf leaders must now work out how to spend the proceeds of what could be the last big gush of oil wealth Some promise to pay down debts and save for a post-petroleum future Yet there will be pressure to share the bounty with the publicand few checks on those who wish to splash out on mega-projects or global influence The impact in diplomatic circles is already visible On a visit to Jeddah in July America President Joe Biden bumped fists with Muhammad bin Salman the Saudi crown prince Mr Biden had until recently kept the prince at arm length; the current political imperative to bring down petrol prices leaves little room for moral stancesExpensive oil augments the financial power of the Gulf states at home and abroad opening a gusher of public spending and steering flows of money around the world The long rise in oil prices in the 2000s helped fuel huge global imbalances depressed interest rates and attracted a stream of supplicants looking to curry favour Cheap oil brings shrinking ambitions When the last sustained period of high prices ended in 2014 it seemed as if the old social contract which promised hefty subsidies and cushy lifetime gigs in the public sector would have to change There was talk of diversification higher domestic fuel and food priceseven taxes A period of rock-bottom oil prices and the hit from covid saw fiscal positions deteriorate This year windfall offers an opportunity to strengthen them see chart 1 Bahrain public debt rose to 130% of gdp in 2020 but the country budget is based on the assumption that oil will fetch a mere $60 a barrel High prices may allow it to reduce its debt ratio by about 12 percentage points this year even though it is the smallest producer in the Gulf Co-operation Council or gcc a group that also comprises Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Oman debt burden is projected to fall by more than 20 percentage points of gdp Other leaders aim to save much of their earnings Mohammed al-Jadaan the Saudi finance minister says his government will not touch its oil bonanza at least this year It will put away the money at the central bank then use it in 2023 to replenish foreign reserves or top up the Public Investment Fund pif the sovereign-wealth fund that has become the kingdom main driver of investment Bahrain will use some of its surplus to refill a fund meant to provide for future generations which it drained during the pandemicYet the pressure to spend will be intense Gulf economies have not been as squeezed by soaring prices as the rest of the world The imf expects inflation in the gcc to peak at 31% this year well below levels in America and Europe Abundant cheap foreign labour keeps wage costs low Most countries rely on fuel subsidies to limit inflation A strong dollar meanwhile holds down the cost of imports five of the six gcc members peg their currencies to the greenback Under the pumpResidents in the Gulf are nonetheless feeling the pinch The uae phased out its fuel subsidies in 2015 and petrol prices climbed by 79% from January to July when the government raised them once again to 452 dirhams $123 a litre That is not bad by global standards but shockingly expensive for a rich petrostatedrivers in Saudi Arabia pay half as much In July the uae announced that it would almost double the welfare budget for poor citizens from 27bn dirhams to 5bn Eligible families will receive stipends for housing and education plus an allowance to offset higher food and energy costs With just 1m citizens representing 10% of the total population the uae can afford to splurge a bit Satisfying the citizenry will be a bigger challenge in Saudi Arabia where two-thirds of the population of 35m are nationals The Saudi government used past oil booms to offer more jobs and higher wages in the public sector Doing so now would run counter to Vision 2030 an economic-diversification plan meant to shift the kingdom away from oil Firms already grumble about how hard it is to retain talent Many young Saudis see private-sector work as a fun distraction until a government job comes alongOil wealth offers other ways to shield citizens from cost pressures In 2016 the Gulf states agreed to introduce a value-added-tax of 5% and four have done so since the laggards are Kuwait and Qatar Saudi Arabia has gone much further In 2020 it tripled vat to 15% hoping to offset the fiscal effects of the pandemic and low oil prices “You have a policy tool you didn’t have before” says Nasser Saidi a Lebanese economist who runs an advisory firm in Dubai “Rather than increase spending or hiring you could lower vat” Competing with such concerns is the need to think long-term: beyond the boom and ultimately beyond oil At the modernist offices of Bahrain sovereign-wealth fund such thoughts are sobering “Of course we’re all happy the oil price is high but the focus needs to stay on the non-oil economy” says an executive Working out what that means in practice is no easy task Some sovereign-wealth managers in the Gulf say their mandates have become almost contradictory They are meant to husband oil wealth for future generations but are increasingly asked to deploy capital to fuel non-oil growth a job that entails plenty of riskGulf countries have not always done a good job of judging which risks to take The region is littered with failed mega-projects from earlier booms Saudi Arabia gleaming financial district meant to compete with Dubai was plagued by delays and cost overruns When it was eventually finished it sat empty: banks saw no reason to move The uae spent billions to create artificial islands shaped like a map of the world More than a decade later the archipelago is derelict The uae ambitious plans to become a semiconductor-manufacturing hub and a centre for health tourism have similarly fizzled out Wild flights of fancy like Neom stand ready to absorb a hefty chunk of the oil money this time round Saudi Arabia also wants to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029 spraying desert mountains with snow; Dubai has a zany plan to create 40000 jobs in the metaverse in five years Even less ostentatious projects may prove wasteful Saudi Arabia sees tourism as the centre of its post-oil economy providing at least 10% of jobs and gdp The oil boom will give the pif billions to throw at resorts amusement parks and other diversions Yet Saudi officials cannot point to a proper assessment showing that its hoped-for 100m tourists will in fact choose to visit the kingdom each year As Ali al-Salim a Kuwaiti investor notes: “It a pretty fickle business to be the linchpin of your economic plan”The Gulf states would be wise to focus on areas where they have clearer competitive advantages Developing expertise in desalination techniques and technologies much as Israel has done could make a virtue of the region aridity Investments in green-energy technologies like hydrogen could offer a source of revenues after the energy transition Mr Saidi proposes investing in renewables projects and climate-mitigation strategies in Asia and Africa as a green version of China Belt and Road Initiative “This is a moment when you want to look again at how you provide foreign aid” he argues Tee offCertainly the boom stands to reshape the Gulf relations with the rest of the worldas demonstrated by Mr Biden trip to Jeddah Enormous quantities of Saudi money are being spent to burnish the kingdom reputation in other contexts as well The world of golf for example is being transformed as liv Golf a Saudi-backed rival to the pga tour lures stars with fantastical payouts The country started hosting a Formula 1 race in 2021 Pop stars including Justin Bieber Mariah Carey and David Guetta have recently performed in the kingdomThe boom will also have less tangible international consequences The gcc combined current-account surplus this year may run to more than $400bn or 04% of global gdp see chart 2a slightly higher share of world output than the biggest surpluses achieved before the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In past booms oil profits have been recycled into investment flows back to America through purchases of Treasuries for instance funding America current-account deficits Yet America has become the world largest producer of oil and big emerging economies have grown richer and developed a thirst for the stuff Thus the Gulf surplus today is matched in part by weaker balance-of-payments positions in big emerging economies That includes China and India but also scores of smaller countries including a few like Sri Lanka for which the surge in the cost of imported oil has been crippling High oil prices have hit the world as a whole harder than they did in the 2000s This is because they are largely the result of interruptions to supply especially from Russia rather than robust growth in global demand More than a few governments have already approached Gulf leaders for moneyalbeit to meet urgent obligations rather than to greenify their economies Like China and India Saudi Arabia and the uae have played a growing role lending to poorer countries over the past two decades taking over a position once reserved for advanced economies and multilateral institutions like the World Bank The developing crisis across low- and middle-income economies could give Gulf states significant leverage over less fortunate places should they choose to wield itIt may well be the last such opportunity In poor countries and rich ones the pain of soaring energy costs adds a new urgency to efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels At the heart of the boom the feeling is palpable “There a ‘days-are-numbered’ kind of sentiment” says Mr al-Salim the Kuwaiti investor “You look at the state Europe is in I don’t think they’re going to allow themselves to be this vulnerable years from now” Which raises a question Will the Gulf?

 Aug 5th 2022,For a change American inflation is lower than expected,Editor note August 10th 2022: This article originally published on August 5th has been updated after the release of the latest consumer-price inflation figuresWhat a difference a couple of data points make Much of the recent talk about America economy had focused on the possibility of stagflation as gdp shrank and prices soared Suddenly though things look rosier First on August 5th statisticians reported that 530000 jobs were created in the previous monthmore than twice as many as expected Then on August 10th they reported that consumer prices in July were the same as in Junethe first absence of month-on-month inflation since early 2020 Could the doomsayers be wrong and America really be about to enjoy both an economic boom and price stability?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNot so fast It is foolish to rush to any conclusion based on a week worth of data especially amid the lingering covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine Previous bursts of optimism have proved unlike inflation to be transitory Moreover a closer look at both reports gives as much reason for consternation as for celebrationStart with the jobs figures America unemployment rate in July fell to 35% matching a half-century low hit just before the pandemic Normally that would have been greeted with unalloyed joy But the ultra-strong labour market is a challenge for companies struggling to hire staff Wages rose at an annual pace of 52% over the past three months up from 47% in June Meanwhile the dominant factor in the drop in inflation was the recent fall in oil prices Once volatile food and energy costs are stripped out core inflation is still up by 59% compared with a year earlier Taken together the data cast a fresh light on a debate that has raged among economists this year: just how big a trade-off the Federal Reserve faces between inflation and jobs as it tightens monetary policy Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has long insisted that present labour-market tightness may mean there is a path whereby companies can reduce their demand for new workers without large numbers ending up on the dole In other words the trade-off could be less severe than in previous periods of monetary tightening One way of understanding the debate is to consider the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu also known as the natural rate of unemployment It refers to the lowest level of unemployment that an economy can sustain before wage inflation starts to accelerate Not directly observable it is based on estimates The concept of the nairu was once central to economic analysis and to the Fed thinking about rates But it fell out of favour before the pandemic when unemployment dipped below the assumed nairu range of 4-55% without any discernible pickup in inflation In a strategic review published in 2020 the Fed indicated that the concept would no longer figure prominently in its policy decisionsHowever the surge in inflation over the past year alongside the sharp drop in joblessness has put the nairu back in the spotlight There is a good case that it shifted markedly higher early in the pandemic In mid-2020 unemployment soared to almost 15% As Brandyn Bok and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau of the San Francisco Fed have noted such a jump would normally have warranted a bigger slowdown in inflation than actually occurred The fact that there was no deflation implies that the natural rate of unemployment probably shifted higher The researchers estimated that the nairu may have reached 8% in 2020 before edging down to 6% at the end of 2021 Now the economy may be experiencing the flipside of an elevated nairu: higher-than-expected inflation as unemployment fallsStructural changes in the economy during covid help explain why the natural rate of unemployment may have increased From the boom in delivery and warehouse work to the subsequent recovery in restaurant and travel work employers’ staffing needs have evolved fast Compounding that has been a change in what people expect from their jobs epitomised by the shift to more remote working One normal response from companies has been to offer higher wagesA gap between the measured unemployment rate of 35% and the estimated natural rate of 6% implies that wage growth is likely to remain strong in the coming months That will feed through into core inflation even if oil prices continue to fall A pessimistic interpretation is that the Fed may have to keep raising rates until measured unemployment approaches the nairu If so millions of people would lose their jobsA more hopeful interpretation is that the gap may ultimately be closed more by the nairu itself falling rather than by unemployment rising After the Fed most recent rate rise in July Mr Powell laid out this perspective: “Logically if the pandemic and the disorder in the labour market caused the natural rate to move up then as the labour market settles down in principle you should see it move back down”It is easy to see why the Fed no longer places the nairu on the pedestal that it once did Not only is it invisible it is also unstable especially when the economy itself is in flux Yet slippery as it is it gets to the crux of today concerns Workers may rejoice at evidence of rapid job growth and wage increases Only when these occur alongside a continued deceleration of inflation will economists’ consternation give way to true celebration For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 3rd 2022,An anatomy of this year market mayhem,AFTER A FRANTIC sell-off in the first half of the year investors are taking a breather The S&P 500 index of American stocks for instance is back around the level it was at the start of June Yet with a little less than five months of 2022 remaining it would take a turnaround of astonishing proportions to avoid a torrid year in financial markets The period distinguishing characteristics are already clear: the slump has been unusually deep and unusually broad If the year ended now an investor in the MSCI All Country World Index of global stocks would have lost 15% the lowest return since 2008 The broad-based decline across asset classes has added another element of pain too Most obviously both stocks and bonds have been hammered The good news is that distress has been concentrated among a few types of assets and firms Whether that silver lining remains come the end of the year is uncertain Such a coincident fall in stocks and bonds is rare When stock prices fall because of a weakening economy bond prices usually rise owing to expectations of interest-rate cuts bolstering a mixed portfolio Conversely stocks often benefit from a stronger economy while bonds sell off The double dip this time is driven by surging inflation expected interest-rate rises and a belief that the economic situation will deteriorate An investment in the FTSE Global World Government Bond Index would have lost 13% so far in 2022 making this the first year since 1986 when the index was established in which there have been double-digit falls in both stocks and bonds globallyMoreover equity markets have been battered almost everywhere Stocks in Europe Japan and emerging markets are all down As a result there are precious few winners The Bloomberg Commodity Index comprising energy agricultural and industrial commodities is up by 18% since January Oil and gas companies have been bolstered by Russia invasion of Ukraine and the massive disruption to oil and gas supplies that followed MSCI stock indexes for oil exporters like the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are up as are those for Brazil and Indonesia which produce other commodities The MSCI Chile index is up by more than 20% but with a market capitalisation of less than $40bn that is not much consolation to investors If you were presented with this degree of misery 20 years ago you might have expected the odd mainstream financial firm to start looking wobbly Perhaps the most unusual thing of all is how serious distress so far has been largely confined to two groupsboth outside mainstream Western finance The first is Chinese property developers; sales of which have cratered this year driven by concerns about the financial health of the companies and the economic impact of protracted covid-19 lockdowns A bond maturing in January 2024 issued by Country Garden a developer which until recently held an investment-grade credit rating now offers a yield of more than 100% up from 5% this time last year But China strict capital controls mean that the turmoil has produced few reverberations outside the country so far The second place where distress has emerged is the world of cryptocurrency and decentralised finance Celsius Terra and Three Arrows Capital respectively a crypto-oriented lender a stablecoin and a crypto-oriented hedge fund have all gone to the wall The big question for the rest of the year is whether the pockets of distress will continue to be isolated Already the strain in emerging markets which are confronted with rising global interest rates as well as elevated food and energy prices is becoming clear As of late July around 36% of issuers on the JPMorgan Chase Emerging Market Bond Index had yields above 10% a figure which peaked at only 29% during the market panic in March 2020 Fortunately for the West its mainstream financial institutions have become less exposed to emerging markets over time Another source of angst could be the euro zone if the energy crisis intensifies over the winter: something the European Central Bank tried to guard against in July by creating a new mechanism to curb bond-market jitters And as it has grown harder and more expensive to issue corporate bonds indebted firms everywhere could face a building funding crunch One of the more unusual years in finance over the past few decades is not over yet 
 Aug 3rd 2022,Does high inflation matter?,Editor note: This is an updated version of a column first published in April It started in America but the surge in inflation has spread to the rest of the rich world Consumer prices across the oecd club of mostly rich countries are rising by 103% year on year the fastest pace of increase in at least three decades In the Netherlands inflation is nearing 12% even higher than in America while in Estonia it is over 22% How forcefully should central banks respond to the inflationary surge? The answer depends on how much damage inflation is causing And that depends on whom you askInflation is regarded as costly because it erodes people savings and distorts price signals And there are unquestionably instances when it has brought an economy to its knees During Weimar Germany period of hyperinflation in the 1920s people savings evaporated eliminating the middle class and paving the way for the rise of fascism Inflation also spiralled out of control in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe As price signals broke down millions went without foodBut in more moderate inflationary episodes such as the current one the evidence for economic carnage is weaker One common worry is that increases in prices outpace rises in wages causing people real incomes to decline This has almost certainly been happening across rich countries in recent months American real hourly earnings fell by 36% in the year to JuneOn the whole though economists see a tenuous connection between inflation and workers’ real living standards Sometimes prices rise faster than wages; sometimes they do not British real wages grew strongly during the inflationary era of the 1970s According to a study published in 1975 American workers whether unionised or not had seen inflation-busting pay rises in the preceding decade The Economist has looked at data for 35 oecd countries going as far back as 1990 In years when inflation exceeded 5% we find real wages rose on average Inflation can also help the unemployed find jobs even as it hurts people already in work After the global financial crisis of 2007-09 sterling depreciated lifting inflation in Britain and reducing real wages Companies could then afford to hire more workersThe notion that inflation messes with price signals another putative economic cost is also exaggerated at moderate levels Capitalism allocates resources via movements in relative prices: if the price of cars rises compared with that for bicycles more cars should eventually be produced The worry is that inflation disrupts this process making it harder to discern the “true” relative prices of cars and bicyclesIn a paper published in 2018 however Emi Nakamura of the University of California Berkeley and colleagues examine price dispersion for the same sorts of products over time Looking at the period of high inflation in the 1970s they find “no evidence that prices deviated more from their optimal level” than just before the pandemic when inflation was far lower The “strong conclusions about [the] optimality of low inflation rates [in this regard] need to be reassessed” they concludeSophisticated papers such as these back up a broader body of work going back decades that questions the link between inflation and growth A paper published by the imf in 2014 noted that “few empirical studies have even tried to find costs of single-digit inflation” In 1996 Michael Bruno and William Easterly then both of the World Bank found “no evidence of any relationship between inflation and growth at annual inflation rates less than 40%” The next year Paul Krugman wrote that “even though inflation is universally regarded as a terrible scourge efforts to measure its costs come up with embarrassingly small numbers”So does the rich world current bout of inflation have minimal costs or even none at all? The trouble for economists is that there is a world outside their research Few people know or care about their results But they know what they think about inflation: they utterly implacably loathe itInflation seems to hold a special place in the public consciousness Our analysis of English-language newspapers and blog posts suggests that during the 2010s media organisations mentioned inflation 50% more frequently than they mentioned unemployment even though joblessness during that decade was a far bigger economic problem In the 1990s Robert Shiller of Yale University asked people in a number of countries about their opinions on inflation and compared them with the views of economists He found that ordinary people held much more extreme views on the subject than the academics who study it for a livingPeople believe that inflation makes them poorer They worry it makes it harder to plan And they believe that inflation is a sign that unscrupulous companies are taking advantage of them two-thirds of Americans ascribe the recent rise in inflation to corporate greed Economists by contrast are more equivocal in their answers More than half of Americans “fully agreed” that preventing high inflation was as important as stopping drug abuse or maintaining educational standards compared with just 18% of economists In the same survey Mr Shiller found that 46% of people wanted the government to lower the price level after an inflation spike ie to engineer deflation something few economists would recommendGet realPerhaps policymakers should just ignore the views of ordinary people If experts find that inflation has surprisingly low costs then what more information is needed to guide policy? Another way of looking at it however is that the psychological costs of high inflation are real and that central bankers and governments should take them into account Fighting inflation by forcefully tightening fiscal or monetary policy is often seen as a hard-nosed choice because it cools the economy and risks provoking a recession In fact it is one of the most populist policies out there Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 28thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 2nd 2022,Global inequality is rising again,COVID-19 WAS never going to be good for the poor At first however the disease was not associated with rising inequality Richer economies tended to suffer larger declines in GDP per person than many poor ones in 2020and within those countries hefty stimulus packages protected the poorest from penury As the pandemic wore on though its effects on global inequality shifted Richer countries enjoyed better access to vaccines than poorer ones and were more able to sustain spending on programmes to support incomes and bolster recoveries The net effect of the pandemic has been to raise inequality between countries back to the levels of the early 2010s on some measures Thus the long decline in global inequality that began around 1990 has come to an endand gaps between rich and poor now look likely to widen as poor countries take longer to recover from covid Yet the causes of inequality resurgence are not universally bleak Paradoxically part of the explanation lies in increasing incomes among the formerly impoverishedTo understand why consider the two different forms of inequality researchers look at: gaps that occur within a country and those between countries From the 1980s through the 2000s inequality rose within most countries including many in the emerging world as rich Americans Britons Chinese and so on did better than their poorer compatriots The contribution of this within-country dynamic was swamped however by the diverging fortunes of rich and poor countries as a whole Because poorer countries were growing faster than richer onesand massive ones like China and India were doing especially wellthe net effect of changes across the world economy was a sharp decline in global inequalityProgress then ground to a halt in the decade before the pandemic Shifts to the distribution of income within countries ceased to push inequality higher indeed in some recent years within-country shifts served to reduce global inequality on net But this generally welcome trend occurred alongside much more halting progress in the closing of income gaps between countries In the 2000s for example an economy at the 30th percentile of the global income distribution grew two percentage points faster on an average annual basis than did America in terms of GDP per person In the 2010s by contrast GDP per person at the 30th percentile grew slightly slower than in America As a consequence measures of global inequality showed very little improvement if any from about 2014 until the eve of the pandemicDuring the pandemic vaccines and more generous rich-world stimulus widened the gap between countries Worse still reckons the World Bank the burden of income losses in poorer countries fell disproportionately on those at the bottom of the income spectrum As a result the increase in global inequality reflected both the widening gap between rich and poor countries as well as increased inequality within poor economies Developing countries now face gloomier economic prospects Scarring effects of the pandemic including forgone schooling and investment stand to constrain growth as do heavy debt burdens and the challenges posed by Russia war in Ukraine The IMF reckons that by 2024 output across the emerging world will probably remain more than 5% below the pre-pandemic trend while that in rich economies will be less than 1% below trend and output in America will be above itYet higher global inequality is also the outcome of a happier development Recent work by Ravi Kanbur of Cornell University and Eduardo Ortiz-Juarez and Andy Sumner of King College London suggests that measured global inequality may rise in steady fashion in the years ahead for much the same reason it fell in recent decades While the emerging world as a whole has gained ground on rich countries since the 1980s the lion share of the reduction in global inequality over that time was attributable to the rapid economic growth of China and India GDP per person in China now stands at roughly the global averagea milestone India may reach in the 2030s As incomes in those countries cross that threshold their continued growth will become a source of increasing rather than decreasing inequality The enrichment of two countries that are home to more than a third of the world population is undoubtedly one of the big economic success stories of the past four decades It has the unfortunate effect however of making the disappointing progress of those at the lower end of the income distribution more apparentRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 28thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 1st 2022,The global housing boom is running out of steam,Diana Mousaly spent months searching for a home in Windsor Canada southernmost city It was the height of covid-19 and prices were rising across the country Ms Mousaly a 27-year-old clerk at the local police service viewed nearly 100 homes and made 60 or so offersoften at hundreds of thousands of Canadian dollars above the asking pricebefore finally closing on a property last September A decade ago her parents purchased a home for half the amount “It four times bigger than mine” she sighsMs Mousaly may have bought at the wrong time For the past two decades Canada white-hot property market has burned ever brighter Now things are cooling down: prices have fallen for three consecutive months The same is true in other frothy markets In New Zealand where valuations at the end of 2021 were up by 45% since the start of the pandemic the price of a home has also fallen for three straight months In Sweden prices fell by nearly 4% in June the steepest monthly decline since the global financial crisis in 2007-09 Two in five homes in Australia are worth less than they were three months agoEven where prices are still rising higher borrowing costs are dampening buyer enthusiasm With monthly payments on a typical new mortgage in America now three-quarters higher than three years ago loan applications are down by more than a quarter from their peak in January The share of first-time buyers has hit a 13-year low Some of the froth is also being blown away in Britain Mortgage approvals in April fell back to pre-pandemic levels In May home sales fell by a tenth compared with the previous year If the global housing boom is finally running out of steam how far will prices fall? Analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy forecast modest drops of 5-10% in America and Britain In these countries homeowners are less likely to be forced to sell by rising mortgage costs since fixed-rate loans are common In Australia and Sweden the analysts reckon prices could slip by 15% With higher levels of household debt and thus more exposure to rate rises Canada and New Zealand are most vulnerableprices in these countries could fall by 20%Two factors should prevent house prices from entering a death spiral One is the shortage of homes in most rich countries Depending on the estimate America is short of either 38m or 58m homes; England needs an estimated 345000 new homes a year and is building half that number; and Canada requires an additional 35m by 2030 at the current pace of construction The other factor is tight labour markets Low unemployment in many rich countries means people are less likely to fall behind on their debts Combined with stronger household finances this should prevent a slump on the scale of the financial crisis in all but the wobbliest markets But the pain will be unevenly spread Pandemic hotspots are particularly vulnerable During lockdowns the search for large gardens or green space sent housing markets into a frenzy Parisians fled to the French countryside Turkish residents left Istanbul for resort towns Londoners wanting to take advantage of remote work flocked to leafy neighbourhoods like Richmond and Dulwich or escaped the city altogether for cheaper homes Cracks have started to appear in these markets Fewer bidding wars are taking place in the American mountain towns and sunbelt states that attract well-paid Californians and New Yorkers More than half of homes for sale in Salt Lake City Utah had their price cut in June; in Boise Idaho three-fifths did The question now is how low prices will go The Royal Bank of Canada thinks sales in its home country will plummet from their peak in 2021 by more than 40% worse even than in the financial crisis when they fell by 38% Things may not be quite as dramatic elsewhere But for owners used to prices heading in only one direction any drop will come as a shock 
 Jul 28th 2022,How high property prices can damage the economy,Economists’ interest in land has waxed and waned over time For the political economists of the 18th and 19th centuries it was central to understanding the world They believed that the distribution of rents from land ownership could explain the yawning gaps between the rich and poor and all sorts of other economic ills Economists cared less about land in the 20th century Since the turn of the millennium however they have increasingly debated the impact that restrictive zoning laws have on the economic output of cities The global financial crisis sparked an increase in research on the consequences of property slumps Banks’ balance-sheets tend to weaken and worried homeowners spend less potentially triggering a recession America housing crash during 2007-09 in particular was much studied Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn recent years another strand of research has emerged which rather like the political economists of yore attributes many long-standing economic ills to land It explores how high and rising land prices affect lending investment and ultimately productivity and much of it looks closely at China long property boom The worrying conclusion is that high and rising property prices can also have damaging economic effects by crowding out productive investment and leading to a misallocation of capital In the most extreme cases inflated land prices may already be the cause of a protracted slowdown in productivity growth Real estate is the largest asset class in the world In 2020 it made up around 68% of the world non-financial assets which includes plant and machinery as well as intangibles such as intellectual property Land rather than the structures built on top of it accounts for slightly over half of that 68% As values have ballooned the share of land in non-financial assets has increased sharply in some countries though few report the data In Britain for instance it went from 39% in 1995 to 56% in 2020 Because land can easily be valued and cannot be hidden or broken it is good collateral to borrow against So when prices are rising as they have in most places for much of the past few decades the initial effect is to boost lending and economic activity Households can use their increasingly valuable property to borrow at lower interest rates than they otherwise would Land-owning firms too can access finance more easily Fatter asset holdings also make people feel more comfortable spending money But the use of land as collateral has harmful effects too especially in places where banks play a big role in financing companies Firms’ ability to borrow tends to be determined by their existing assets rather than their productive potential And those that own land find it much easier to borrow from banks than those say with lots of intangible assets A paper published in 2018 by Sebastian Doerr of the Bank for International Settlements found that listed American firms with more property collateral were able to borrow and invest more than their competitors even though they were less productive These effects were also evident in Spain just before the global financial crisis In research published last year Sergi Basco of Universitat Barcelona and David Lopez-Rodriguez and Enrique Moral-Benito of the Bank of Spain noted that property-owning manufacturers in the country tended to receive more bank credit than other firms Rising property prices can also discourage productive lending and lead to capital being misallocated When housing markets boom banks tend to engage in more mortgage lending But because lenders face capital constraints this is often accompanied by reduced lending to businesses The effect is illustrated by research published in 2018 by Indraneel Chakraborty of the University of Miami Itay Goldstein of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Andrew MacKinlay of Virginia Tech The paper which looks at data from America between 1988 and 2006 found that a one-standard-deviation increase in house prices in areas where a bank has branches reduced lending growth to firms that borrow from the same bank by 42% The total investment undertaken by the affected firms fell by 21% Such crowding-out effects may have been sizeable in other places too considering that banks around the rich world have sharply increased their mortgage lending Across 17 advanced economies mortgages’ share of total bank loans climbed from 32% in 1952 to 58% in 2016 the latest year for which data are availableWhatever the effects of high land prices in the West the scale of the problem in China appears even bigger given that the country investors have a huge appetite for real estate A range of recent research suggests that China high land prices shift bank lending away from land-light manufacturers and reduce spending on research and development by listed firms; they also appear to lead to a reallocation of managerial talent towards the property sector One especially striking result comes from a paper published in 2019 by Harald Hau of the University of Geneva and Difei Ouyang of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing based on data from manufacturers in 172 Chinese cities It concludes that a 50% increase in property prices would raise borrowing costs reduce investment and productivity and result in a 355% decline in the firms’ value-added output Hitting home The conclusion that high and rising property prices can throttle economic activity carries important implications for how policymakers should treat investment in land and housing Encouraging much more housebuilding for instance would help deflate collateral values Restricting the ownership of multiple properties would alter the distribution of that collateral And limiting the amount of mortgage lending banks can do might lead more credit to flow to productive purposes A more ambitious idea would be to tax land values which by lowering the market value of land might reduce its attractiveness as collateral Such a tax was funnily enough the goal of many 18th- and 19th-century reformers as they sought a more equal society A new obsession with land could well revive an old idea Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Should central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Jul 28th 2022,China official growth figures are bad enough to be believed,When china Politburo the 25-member committee that oversees the Communist Party met this time last year to ponder the economy China rulers seemed quite confident Their annual growth target was in easy reach and they were keen to crack down further on the country overstretched property developers As The Economist went to press the Politburo was preparing to meet again But the economy looks quite different China attempts to stamp out any outbreak of covid-19 have crippled manufacturing intermittently and consumption more persistently Distressed developers have stopped working on pre-sold flatsand aggrieved homebuyers have refused to pay their mortgages until construction resumesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis has put China rulers in a pickle They seem determined to stick to their zero-covid policy And they would no doubt love to cling to their official gdp growth target of “around 55%” But it has become clear they cannot do both Unless of course they fiddle the growth figuresThat is not beyond them But there is so far little sign of it The most recent data showed that the economy grew by only 04% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier This was not only bad but worse than expected by private forecasters In a large teleconference in May Li Keqiang China prime minister urged local officials to do more for the economy But he also cautioned them to seek truth from facts abiding by statistical regulationsWhen he was himself a local official in the north-eastern province of Liaoning Mr Li sought the truth about the provincial economy from three facts in particular: the electricity it consumed the cargo travelling on its railways and the amount of loans disbursed by its banks These indicators he felt were more reliable than the official gdp figures In a similar spirit John Fernald Eric Hsu and Mark Spiegel of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco have shown that a judicious combination of eight alternative indicators including electricity consumption rail cargo retail sales and consumer expectations does a reasonably good job of tracking China economic ups and downs Seven of these indicators all except consumer confidence have already been updated for the three months from April to June They can therefore be used to cross-check the latest official growth figureThe chart shows our attempt to do that using much the same method as Mr Fernald and his co-authors Our calculation is not designed to show if China has systematically overstated gdp growth over the past two decades But it can detect if reported growth is nearer its underlying trend than it should be given how far the other seven indicators have strayed from their own usual trajectories The awful data on retail sales and construction in the second quarter were for example far outside the norm But these shocking figures were partly offset by respectable numbers for rail freight and exportsIn all these indicators suggest the official growth measure was honest They would be consistent with gdp growth that is if anything a little higher than the 04% reported Our approach cannot reveal every kind of statistical skulduggery but it does suggest China made no extra effort to fudge the figures in the second quarter despite the unusual ugliness of the time China rulers want to fight the downturn the virus and doubts about their country data They are doing a better job on the last two counts than on the first For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 28th 2022,Reminiscences of a financial columnist,It is telling that one of the best books about financial markets was published almost a century ago “Reminiscences of a Stock Operator” by Edwin Lefevre is a fictionalised account of the exploits of Jesse Livermore a speculator Livermore made a fortune selling the market short during the financial panic of 1907 He would repeat the trick in 1929 The book captures a particular timeof bucket shops insider pools and dandy tips on Western Union or American Steel But it is also timelessListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs this writer finishes a four-year stint as Buttonwood the one tentative conclusion he draws from the experience is something that Livermore realised a century ago: there is nothing new on Wall Street What happens today in the markets has happened before and will happen again Every extreme of greed or fear has a precedent Technology changes but people do notThe beginning for this Buttonwood was May 2018 At the time there was a good deal of optimism among American and European asset managers about business prospects in China There was much talk about its “Wild West” stockmarketwith lots of retail trading on tips and a rapid turnover of shares Rich-world entrants fancied they would add a dash of professionalism But instead of China market becoming more American the reverse happened In 2020 there was a surge in new accounts at no-fee brokers notably Robinhood catering to small investors in America A gaggle of social-media pundits emerged to mobilise this new army of speculators They piled into tech darlings such as Tesla but also bombed-out stocks such as GameStop a video-games retailer This “meme-stock” craze seemed new but it wasn’t What it most resembled was the bucket shops of early-20th-century America where Livermore first learned to read the markets Here ordinary punters exchanged tips and could bet on the direction of favoured stocks for a tiny initial outlay The Robinhood crowd though they had better technology had similar preferences They were keen on call options on stocks that had the characteristics of long-odds bets As with bucket-shop punts these options mostly expire worthless but can reap a spectacular profit if the share price surgesManias scams and iffy schemes are recurring evils “I used to think that people were more gullible in the 1860s and 1870s than the 1900s” says the narrator of “Reminiscences” But Livermore only had to pick up his newspaper to read about the latest Ponzi scheme or crooked broker More recently there has been the Wirecard fraud the Archegos blow-up the shell-company boom and any number of dodgy digital currencies This year has so far been a rejoinder to such excesses As Livermore knew well tighter money and a giddy stockmarket are a dangerous mix His big short in 1907 was in response to signals from the money markets which were “megaphoning warnings to the entire world” But they were not the only warnings he ever heard In the world of “Reminiscences” bull markets are marked by the “calamity howling” of “old-stagers [who] said everybodyexcept themselveshad gone crazy” Doom-mongers are forever with us Indeed there is a kind of punditry that echoes the millenarian sects of medieval Europe the adherents of which believed they were living in the “last days” It anticipates an endgame in which all excesses will be washed from the markets Perhaps such a reckoning is already in train But it cannot be the endgame because the game never ends If history is anything to go by a big bust would merely set the stage for another phase of play Injuries heal with time Memories of the last brutal bear market eventually fade The unceasing contest between fear and greed resumes The thoughtful investor has a lot to reckon with and that won’t change either There are constant judgments to be made about company managers business strategy economic policy politics and geopoliticsas well as the opinions and likely reactions of other investors who may or may not be as thoughtfulAnd as Livermore knew well any investor has also to fight the “expensive enemies within himself” This endless wrestling with powerful emotions such as hope doubt and fear is a big part of what makes Wall Street so fascinating It has been a great privilege to watch the unfolding drama from this perch and to try to make sense of it all The honour now passes to others Thank you so much for reading Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdWhy markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thCrypto last man standing Jul 9thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 26th 2022,Recession fears weigh on commercial property,Property is usually regarded as a good hedge against inflation Landlords’ ability to increase rents can cushion the blow from rising costs If inflation is driven by strong economic growth rents go up buildings stay full and landlords are assured of rising income Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWorries about the economy however have turned this strategy on its head Strained household budgets and stretched corporate balance-sheets could limit tenants’ ability to pay more rent jeopardising investors’ returns Moreover with the cost of debt rising owners of office towers hotels shopping malls and other types of property risk being stuck with lower returns on assets that may now be overpriced Many fear a correction is coming The darkening mood is in contrast to the optimism of 2021 when returns soared rents rocketed and fundraising fuelled by low interest rates raced to record highs Even as offices remained eerily empty fund managers rushed to park their capital in new blocks of flats labs and warehouses pushing up the global value of professionally managed property by nearly $1trn That stellar performance has since fizzled out The share prices of listed real-estate investment trusts are tanking and expectations for rental growth and returns are being scaled back In America delinquency rates crept up in June for the first time since late 2021 The strain comes on top of other challenges ubs a bank expects the shift to remote work to hit leasing demand for offices by as much as 20% Decarbonisation will require hefty investment in older buildings Meanwhile the decline in bricks-and-mortar stores is bad news for shopping-mall owners and rising air fares threaten the demand for hotelsNo wonder investors are tightening their belts After a record start to 2022 deal activity in America is cooling says Kevin Fagan of Moody Analytics a research firm Transactions that are already under way are taking longer to negotiate; some are being put on hold In America and Britain commercial-property investment between April and June plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic began to $86bn and £10bn $12bn respectively Dealmaking also fell in Germany Not all properties will struggle The highest-quality most energy-efficient buildings with modern amenities and on prime sites typically owned by big institutional investors are expected to fare relatively well By contrast lower-quality assets across Europe lost around a tenth of their value in the second quarter of this year compared with the previous three months reckons Green Street a research firm That decline follows a poor 2021 for many such buildings: rents for lower-quality offices in London fell by 9% last year compared with 2020 even as those for prime office space rose by 8% Some cities will do better than others In America sunbelt markets such as Atlanta Dallas and San Diego are expected to be among the top performers this year providing better returns than places like New York and San Francisco where workers have been slower to return to the office Landlords who can guarantee future rent growth or those in markets with constrained supply are also relatively well-positioned This includes owners of labs warehouses and other logistics property The upshot is that although commercial-property prices might fall the decline is not forecast to be precipitous Analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy reckon that values in America could face a peak-to-trough fall of 6-8% That is a bigger decline than the one at the start of the pandemic but is far from the plunge of 34% during the global financial crisis Another comfort is that banks have become less exposed to commercial property In Britain for instance it makes up almost 7% of lenders’ loan books compared with 12% before the financial crisis Offices malls and warehouses may not provide as much shelter from inflation as investors might like but they have at least become less likely to amplify financial trouble For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 24th 2022,Why it is too early to say the world economy is in recession,Everyone is a pessimist these days On July 14th Steven Blitz of ts Lombard an investment-research firm said that he was now expecting a recession this year in the world largest economy a day after Bank of America made the same call Goldman Sachs another bank expects gdp in the euro zone to fall in both the third and fourth quarters of the year Americans’ Google searches for “recession” have never been so high Traders are selling copper a proxy for industrial health buying the dollar a sign that they are nervous and pricing in interest-rate cuts in 2023Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA number of factors have combined to create a toxic mixture In response to the covid-19 pandemic America overstimulated its economy provoking inflation not just within its borders but beyond them as consumers’ voracious demand for goods bunged up the world supply chains China attempts to stamp out covid compounded these problems Then Russia invasion of Ukraine caused commodity prices to soar In response to the ensuing inflation roughly four-fifths of central banks worldwide have raised interest rates by an average of 15 percentage points After a meeting that ended on July 27th the Federal Reserve raised rates for the fourth time this cycle by three-quarters of a point At the root of recession worries is a fear of the consequences of monetary tightening It is clear that central banks have to take the proverbial punchbowl away from the party Wage growth in the rich world is far too strong given weak productivity growth Inflation is too high But the risk is that higher rates will end the party altogether rather than making it less raucous History is not encouraging in this regard Since 1955 there have been three periods when rates in America rose as much as they are expected to this year: in 1973 1979 and 1981 In each case a recession followed within six months Has recession struck again? Rich-world economies which account for 60% of global gdp have certainly slowed since the heady days of mid-2021 when covid restrictions were being lifted Goldman Sachs produces a “current activity indicator” a high-frequency measure of economic health based on a range of indicators The gauge has slowed in recent weeks see chart 1 Surveys of factory bosses in America and the euro zone by s&p Global a data provider suggest that manufacturers are gloomier than at any time since the early days of the pandemicIt looks too soon though to declare a recessioneven if as some expect statisticians reveal after we go to press on July 28th that between April and June American gdp contracted for the second quarter running This would count as a recession by one rule of thumb but not necessarily by others A series of oddities led gdp to shrink in the first quarter even though the underlying performance of the economy was strong It would also be too soon for Fed tightening to have had an effectMost economists look to America National Bureau of Economic Research nber to find out if the economy is truly in recession Its business-cycle-dating committee considers indicators beyond gdp in making that judgment including jobs numbers and industrial production The Economist has used a similar approach with a little guesswork for the rich world as a whole Many indicators still point to expansion see chart 2 It is hard to argue that a recession has arrivedYet with growth clearly slowing the big question is how bad things will get The few remaining optimists point to the strength of households and firms The public is even gloomier about the economy than it was during the depths of both the global financial crisis and the pandemic see chart 3 But households in the rich world probably still have some $3trn or so in “excess” savings accumulated during the pandemic In America the cash balances of poor households were 70% higher in March than they were in 2019 according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute a bank-affiliated think-tank Moreover people seem more confident about their personal finances than about the state of the economy Across the eu households are about one-third more likely to be positive about their own finances than they have been on average since the data began in the mid-1980s In America an unusually low share of people believe they will be unable to meet debt commitments over the next three months Consumer-spending trackers including from the Bank of England for Britain and JPMorgan Chase for America still look fairly strong Governments are also handing out money to help poorer people cope with roaring energy prices In the euro zone governments are stimulating the economy by the equivalent of about 1% of gdp Britain has offered handouts to poor households In May the Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank reckoned that such spending would largely compensate the poorest households for the rising cost of living though retail energy prices are now likely to rise further still The behaviour of businesses is also reassuring Across rich economies the number of job vacancies is still near a record high In Australia they are more than twice their pre-pandemic level according to data from Indeed a hiring website In America there are more than two open positions for every unemployed person As a result labour markets remain tight You can find some evidence of rising joblessness in the Czech Republic if you squint Overall though the unemployment rate across the oecd club of mostly rich countries is lower now than it was just before the pandemic In half of oecd countries the share of working-age people who are in a joba broader measure of labour-market healthis at an all-time high If history is any guide these figures are inconsistent with a looming recessionFear uncertainty and doubt Declines in investment have in the past played a big role in downturns In recessionary periods since the 1980s for the g7 group of large economies around half the fall in combined gdp in negative quarters came from shrinking capital spending This time investment data have weakened but not catastrophically so according to data compiled by JPMorgan for America the euro zone and Japan Until recently capital spending was booming as firms spent big on remote-working technology and reinforced supply chains Now some believe they have overinvested in capacity Others want to conserve cash An analysis of survey evidence credit conditions and corporate liquidity by Oxford Economics a consultancy suggests that investment in the g7 could decline at an annualised pace of around 05% in the second half of this year That is not good but it is not enough to create a recession by itself The investment declines in past downturns were steeperUnfortunately there is a limit to the confidence that can be taken from good economic data when the fundamental fear of investors is monetary tightening News of any kind it seems can convey bad news about a recession Weak figures confirm that a downturn is approaching Strong data including wage rises suggest central banks are not succeeding in slowing things down requiring further tightening which in turn stands to provoke a recession Only signs that inflation is falling will truly dispel fears of a downturnThere is some relief ahead A gauge of supply-chain snarls compiled by the New York Fed comprising global transport costs among other things has eased American petrol prices are now falling by 3% a week Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy constructs a “news inflation pressure index” which indicates whether the flow of news articles suggests price pressures are building up The indices for America and Britain have fallen of lateBut hopes for a rapid fall in inflation are almost certain to be dashed Past increases in the price of food and energy have not yet fully filtered into headline inflation rates: Morgan Stanley reckons that rich-world inflation will peak at 8% in the third quarter of 2022 Growth in wages shows little sign of easing In earnings calls companies still talk about how best to pass on higher costs to their customers The mass of data confronting economists is useful but an old lesson may still hold: that recessions are hard to spot in real time The nber dates the start of America downturn associated with the global financial crisis to December 2007 Even in August 2008 the Fed staff thought the economy was still growing at an annual pace of about 2% The post-lockdown picture is particularly difficult to interpret Barely anyone thought labour shortages would emerge last year or that inflation would go from bad to worse in 2022 That is the case for pessimism The case for optimism is that the present episode of monetary tightening has only just begun Before it bites there is time for a volatile world economy to deliver more surprisesperhaps even positive ones For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Jul 21st 2022,The ECB latest attempt to hold the euro zone together,IT WAS ALMOST ten years to the day since Mario Draghi then the president of the European Central Bank ended the most acute phase of the euro-zone crisis with the assurance that he would do “whatever it takes” to keep the currency bloc together Now with risks of a fresh debt crisis looming Christine Lagarde his successor as ecb president unveiled the bank latest attempt to make good on that promise The Transmission Protection Instrument tpi announced on July 21st is a bond-buying scheme intended to prevent the spread in borrowing costs between euro-zone governments from widening so far that troubled countries would be at risk of a forced exit from the currencyThe need for such a tool is apparent Shortly before the central bank meeting Mr Draghi resigned as Italy prime minister a role he had unexpectedly taken up last year at the head of an unwieldy coalition The turmoil in Rome placed further pressure on Italian bonds which were already facing higher interest rates amid a potential economic slowdown Rising bond yields risk trapping Italy in a self-reinforcing cycle of higher borrowing costs worries over the sustainability of its debt and ultimately fears that the third-largest economy in the euro zone could not survive inside it The unlimited asset purchases and potentially unlimited latitude for ECB intervention promised by the tpi should alleviate those worries The instrument is open-ended in size allowing the central bank to buy as many assets as it sees fit including not just government bonds but also those from the private sector Any sell-off in government debt would have to be “disorderly and unjustified” for the ECB to take actionbut the bank has claimed unlimited discretion to define these terms for itself Ms Lagarde said that the ECB has the “sovereignty” to determine eligibility criteria itself a word not often heard from the mouths of central bankersThe ECB has left itself much less flexibility however when it comes to determining which countries are eligible for the scheme To win tpi support governments must not be subject to the excessive deficit procedure edp a mechanism used by the European Commission to enforce the euro area fiscal rules; nor the eu excessive imbalance procedure which assesses a broader set of macroeconomic indicators A country public debt must be “sustainable” and its fiscal policies “sound” But in making these judgments the ECB said it will take into account the views of other organisations including the imfThe ECB has therefore given itself the maximum room for manoeuvre in forestalling any repeat of the euro-zone crisis while handing to others the politically delicate task of deciding whether governments’ fiscal policies are appropriate and their debt sustainable This in turn raises the stakes for the commission when deciding whether to place countries into the edp: an assessment that a troubled country has breached the fiscal rules now risks making it ineligible for monetary support That could provoke a flight from its debt as well as confrontation with BrusselsSuch is the price of consensus Ms Lagarde boasted that the tpi won unanimous backing in the ECB often-fractious governing council Hawks had worried that the scheme would prevent markets from disciplining poorly run governments and making accurate appraisals of their solvency Doves fretted that making it too strict would render it pointless The ecb separate decision to raise rates from -05% to 0%its first increase in over a decade and a larger one than investors had been led to expect by the bank itselfmay also have helped the hawks on the council reconcile themselves with such a big intervention in government-bond markets Either way Italy borrowing costs fell after the meeting as investors digested the details of the scheme The euro zone faces a difficult few months with energy bills soaring a potential hard-right government taking office in Italy and Russia war in Ukraine continuing to fuel economic uncertainty But making “whatever it takes” subject to the economic judgments of the Eurocrats in Brussels may be enough for now 
 Jul 21st 2022,Dollar-euro parity may be justified But the yen looks cheap as chips,Imagine you are a Parisian investor trying to decide whether to buy American or European bonds You compare the yields on offer A ten-year bond issued by America Treasury today offers 3%; German bunds return only 12% But buying American means taking a gamble on the euro-dollar exchange rate You are interested in the return in euros The bond issued in Washington will be attractive only if the extra yield exceeds any expected loss owing to swings in currency marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis thinking known as “uncovered interest parity” uip explains why the dollar has recently soared against the euro On July 12th the greenback reached a one-for-one exchange rate with the euro for the first time since 2002 It has since fallen slightly uip posits that changes in interest rates drive currency movements If yields on Treasuries rise relative to those on bunds then the dollar should strengthen until investors expect it to fall over the lifetime of the bonds so that there is no longer any extra return from buying Treasuries The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates above 35% in 2023 more than twice the rate expected to be reached by the European Central Bank The dollar has also risen by 20% against the yen in 2022 so far That is probably because the Bank of Japan is not expected to raise rates above 02% in the next three yearsYet there is more to currency valuation than monetary policy Another theory purchasing-power parity ppp says currencies and prices should adjust until a basket of goods and services costs the same everywhere The Economist has its own lighthearted measure of ppp: the Big Mac index which was updated on July 20th Instead of a basket of goods and services it uses differences in the price of the ubiquitous McDonald burger to judge whether currencies are over- or undervaluedOur measure suggests the weak euro may be justified see chart The headline index which assumes Big Macs should cost the same everywhere predicts an exchange rate of 111 dollars per euro But a secondary index which adjusts for differences in gdp says the euro should trade just below dollar parity The gdp-adjusted index takes into account differences in the prices of inputs such as land and labour that are hard or impossible to trade across borders and therefore reflect local incomes At dollar-euro parity a Big Mac is 11% more expensive stateside But because America is richer than Europe such a difference in prices could make senseFor the euro then the two theories of currency valuation look aligned Not so for the yen which is more than 40% undervalued against the dollar on both Big Mac indices Book that flight to Tokyo American burger-lovers The yen has become more undervalued since January both because the dollar has surged and because inflation is much higher in America A Big Mac in Japan including taxes costs ¥390 a price that has not changed since 2018 The American price $515 has gone up by 115% in that time and by 22% since January That uip is explaining recent movements better than ppp is no surprise When exchange rates get out of whack with interest rates traders can make a profit at the touch of a button To the extent that varying purchasing power presents opportunities it is to people and firms who might change the site of production or ship goods across borders That takes time And it is not always possible: the international delivery of Big Macs would be ill-advisedppp can fail even within currency zones Our new index incorporates a change to the source for American Big Mac prices We used to collect an average price from restaurants in four cities: Atlanta Chicago New York and San Francisco These are relatively expensive places Now we use a median price for the whole country provided by McDonald which is lower The result is that the dollar does not look quite as strong The change has been made for the whole history of the index though the previous version is available online We have also refined our method for calculating the gdp-adjusted index Fans of burgernomics should tuck in To view an interactive visualisation of The Economist Big Mac index go to economistcom/big-mac-indexFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 21st 2022,Should central banks’ inflation targets be raised?,When new zealand parliament decided in December 1989 on a 2% inflation target for the country central bank none of the lawmakers dissented perhaps because they were keen to head home for the Christmas break Rather than being the outcome of intense economic debate the figurewhich was the first formal target to be adopted by a central bankowes its origin to an offhand remark by a former finance minister who suggested that the soon-to-be-independent central bank should aim for either zero or 1% inflation The central-bank chief and incumbent finance minister used that as a starting-point before plumping for 0-2% Over time 2% became the standard across the rich worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKShould the somewhat arbitrary goal of 2% be changed? The question may seem a little churlish when central banks are so flagrantly missing their existing targets: annual inflation in America Britain and the euro area for instance is running at around 9% The Federal Reserve experiment with “flexible average-inflation targeting” has coincided with the central bank allowing inflation to get out of hand Yet it is possible that raising the target might help prevent rich countries from returning to the low-inflation low-growth malaise that was the rule for the decade after the global financial crisis The idea therefore warrants consideration High inflation is painful Even if wages keep pace with price growth thereby preserving workers’ incomes in real terms it undermines the function of money both as a unit of account and as a store of value Contracts agreed at one point in time lose their worth rapidly redistributing income and wealth arbitrarily between buyers and sellers or between creditors and debtors Long-term investment and saving decisions become more of a gamble as the case of Turkey illustrates Inflation there is in the region of 80% Yet deflation carries its own costs too Worryingly for mortgage-holders and governments alike it raises the value of debts in real terms which can generate a self-sustaining depression as incomes keep falling relative to debt payments That explains why central banks aim for a low but positive rate of inflation Deciding which low but positive number is desirable is trickier Is a target of 2% actually superior to one of 3% or 4% for instance or does it merely owe its exalted status to tradition? The relative damage done by extremely high or accelerating price growth may be easily visible but economists have struggled to identify differences in the costs to an economy from different stable low-single-digit inflation rates The 20-year period of very low inflation that recently came to an end brought no positive leap forward in productivity nor any change in savings behaviour except in reaction to the global financial crisis points out Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank in Washington If the costs of a slightly higher inflation target are small the benefits are potentially sizeable Chiefly it could help central bankers avoid the so-called zero lower bound on nominal interest rates Interest rates cannot go too far into negative territory because they risk destabilising the banking system: depositors could always choose to empty their bank accounts and hold cash which in effect carries an interest rate of zero instead That also limits the efficacy of negative interest rates After the financial crisis some central banks set slightly negative rates on commercial banks’ reserves but lenders had little ability to pass them on to their retail clients The impotence of negative interest rates encouraged central banks to adopt unconventional policies such as quantitative easing Higher inflation targets are a different solution to the problem of the lower bound If the public expects the central bank to generate more inflation in future then the interest rate in real terms can still be sharply negative stimulating the economy even without nominal interest rates needing to venture below zero Allowing moderately higher inflation in normal times could therefore make it easier for the central bank to give a boost to the economy when trouble hitsThe opportunity to escape the lower bound on interest rates is no small thing The current spell of monetary-policy tightening notwithstanding the risk remains that interest rates will stay relatively low The long-term factors that were weighing on interest rates before the pandemic such as an ageing population and low productivity growth are still in place There may be a benefit in the short term too to raising targets now Reducing stubbornly high inflation requires cooling the economy which generally involves raising the unemployment rate The lower the inflation target the more unemployment central banks need to generate to get there If the costs of inflation at 3% really are not much different from inflation at 2% central banks will be generating additional unemployment for little benefit Seizing the inflationary momentSet against this however are the consequences of reneging on a 30-year promise The experience of the past year has made clear that the public detests inflation; both finance ministries and central banks are being excoriated for losing control of price growth To shift the goalposts now could give the impression of giving up the fight entirely Inflation targeting was meant to anchor the public expectations of price growth Changing the target could undermine that objective altogether by creating expectations that it will be raised again the next time inflation roars As long as inflation is so far off-target such considerations seem likely to stay the hand of any would-be monetary reformers Yet once it peaks restoring a degree of central banks’ credibility the pain of further disinflation together with the promise of well and truly escaping the zero lower bound could just start to make the idea of higher targets more alluring For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Inflation shows both the value and limits of monetary-policy rules Jul 14thAre central banks in emerging markets now less of a slave to the Fed?

 Jul 21st 2022,The Fed put morphs into a Fed call,When stocks boomed early in the pandemic an internet meme captured the madness of the moment On the left-hand side of the image a worried man exclaims that simply creating money cannot save the economy; on the right a man representing the Federal Reserve replies “Haha money printer go brrr” while cranking out dollars Joseph Politano author of Apricitas an economics newsletter recently tweaked the meme to better fit the present situation On the left the worried man laments that excessive monetary tightening is increasing the risk of a recession; to the right the Fed representative retorts “Haha money vacuum go brrr” while hoovering up dollarsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn more analytical if less humorous terms another way of framing this shift is to ask whether the Fed put has become a Fed call The concept of a Fed put dates back to the era of Alan Greenspan a former chairman of the central bank Starting with the stockmarket crash in 1987 and continuing for more than three decades the Fed earned a reputation for easing policy notably by cutting interest rates whenever share prices plunged To traders this looks a bit like a put option a basic hedging tool that sets a price floor for investments A Fed call would imply just the opposite: namely that the central bank is in effect capping the market similar to traders who sell call options on their stock holdings Steve Englander of Standard Chartered a bank laid out this provocative idea in a recent note to clients: “The Fed may push back against equity market gains until it is comfortable that disinflation is a lockin other words [there is] a Fed call”This argument may at first glance seem rather crude The Fed has long denied that it targets asset prices in setting monetary policy Narrowly its denials are credible Central bankers look at oodles of data from real-time growth figures to surveys of inflation expectations They cannot afford to be swayed by swings in stocks Moreover share prices reflect many factors ranging from the overall economic outlook to corporate idiosyncrasies Why would the Fed target something that is so volatile and only partially responsive to its actions?In a broader sense however the stockmarket clearly matters to the Fed Jerome Powell its current chairman has repeatedly said that its policies are transmitted to the real economy through financial conditionsa term that refers to the availability and cost of funding for businesses and consumers Stockmarkets play a crucial role in both shaping and gauging financial conditions Admittedly they play a small part in a formal sense: for instance in one index of financial conditions created by the Fed Chicago branch equity and other asset markets account for just ten of its 105 separate inputs contrasting with the bigger weights assigned to credit markets But stocks reflect these other metrics This is especially true at times of stress Share prices have fallen this year as indices of financial conditions have tightened and they have risen when these indices have easedConcerns about inflation only add to the market importance When share prices rise consumers feeling flush tend to spend more money and companies feeling confident tend to hire more workers A paper in 2019 by Gabriel Chodorow-Reich of Harvard University and colleagues concluded that each dollar of increased stockmarket wealth lifted consumer spending by about three cents annually while also boosting employment and wages For a central bank fighting inflation a large rise in share prices would therefore cut against its effortsThis makes for borderline hypocrisy in Fedspeak Sober central bankers can explain that they want “appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions” to help rectify the supply-and-demand imbalances that are fuelling inflation as the Fed did indeed say in the minutes of its rate-setting meeting in June Yet it would be beyond the pale for them to declare that they want “appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated weakness in the stockmarket”even if their meanings are closely alignedIn a market crash that impairs the financial system the Fed put would come back into focus For now though the sell-off has been mostly orderly A sustained rebound in stocks would be unwelcome for the Fed and might well tilt it towards more hawkishness Investors accustomed to viewing the central bank as a friendly force must instead confront the harsh reality of a Fed callFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thCrypto last man standing Jul 9thWhat past market crashes have looked like Jun 30th

 Jul 20th 2022,The 53 fragile emerging economies,For a fleeting moment the protesters seemed to be having a good time On July 9th some of the thousands of Sri Lankans who had taken to the streets to express frustration at the country economic crisis stormed into the president residence where they cooked took selfies and swam in the pool Not long after word came that the president Gotabaya Rajapaksa had fled and would resign His successor Ranil Wickremesinghe until recently the prime minister inherits a mess In April Sri Lanka declared that it could no longer service its foreign debt Its government has sought aid from India and Russia to pay for essential imports The economy is likely to shrink dramatically this year In June annual inflation climbed to 55% If the government is unable to stabilise the situation the country may yet succumb to hyperinflation and further political chaos Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scenes in Sri Lanka may be a sign of things to come elsewhere Debt loads across poorer countries stand at the highest levels in decades Squeezed by the high cost of food and energy a slowing global economy and a sharp increase in interest rates around the world emerging economies are entering an era of intense macroeconomic pain Some countries face years of difficult budget choices and weak growth Others may sink into economic and political crisis All told 53 countries look most vulnerable: they either are judged by the imf to have unsustainable debts or to be at high risk of having them; have defaulted on some debts already; or have bonds trading at distressed levelsToday bleak situation has an analogue in the desperate years of the 1980s and 1990s Then as now a long period of robust growth and easy financial conditions was followed by leaner times and rising debt burdens Macroeconomic shocks rising inflation and eventually soaring interest rates in the rich world pushed many heavily indebted poor economies over the fiscal cliff In August 1982 Mexico government announced that it could no longer service its foreign debt More than three dozen countries had fallen behind on their debts before the year was out By 1990 roughly 6% of the world public debt was in defaultMuch has changed since Many governments opened up to trade liberalised their economies and pursued more disciplined macroeconomic policy Faster growth and better policy led to broad improvements in the fiscal health of emerging economies By 2008 as rich countries sank into an intense financial crisis of their own the level of public debt across poorer economies stood at just 33% of gdpThis allowed them to engage with the global financial system in a manner more like the rich world Most emerging-market governments hoping to tap global capital used to have little choice but to borrow in a foreign currency a risky step that could quickly transform home-currency depreciation into a full-blown crisis Around the turn of the millennium about 85% of new debt issued outside America Europe and Japan was not denominated in the borrower currency But by 2019 roughly 80% of outstanding bonds across the emerging world were denominated in local currencyAs emerging economies’ financial systems matured their governments became better able to tap domestic capital markets The crises of the 1980s and 1990s also taught them the value of stockpiling foreign-exchange reserves; global reserves rose from less than 10% of world gdp in 2005 to 15% in 2020 It was thanks largely to these adjustments that most emerging markets weathered the slow growth of the 2010s and the shock of the pandemic Only six governments defaulted in 2020including Argentina for the ninth time Ecuador and Lebanonequivalent to just 05% of outstanding global public debt But this greater resilience also allowed governments to rack up more borrowing In 2019 public debt stood at 54% of gdp across the emerging world The pandemic then led to an explosion in borrowing In 2020 emerging economies ran an average budget deficit of 93% of gdp not far off the 105% run by rich economies Borrowing stabilised in 2021 as economies rebounded But the picture has grown darker this year The jump in food and energy prices that followed Russia invasion of Ukraine is depressing growth across most of the world increasing debt burdens Rising import bills have drained hard currency from many vulnerable placesincluding Sri Lankaeroding their capacity to service foreign debts Conditions will probably deteriorate as rich-world central banks continue to raise interest rates Hawkish turns by the Federal Reserve tend to diminish risk appetite and draw capital out of emerging markets leaving overextended borrowers high and dryAnd Fed policy has not been this hawkish for some time The federal-funds rate is expected to approach 35% by the end of this year which along with the unwinding of some recent asset purchases would constitute the Fed sharpest tightening since the early 1980s The emerging world has thus experienced net capital outflows every month since March according to the Institute of International Finance an industry group The dollar has risen by over 12% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year and is up by far more against many emerging-market currencies As funding conditions have worsened borrowing costs for some governments have soared About a quarter of the low- and middle-income issuers of debt face yield spreads over American Treasuries of ten percentage points or morea level considered distressed see chart 1The combination of heavy debt burdens slowing global growth and tightening financial conditions will be more than some governments can bear One set of potential victims comprises the poorest economies which have been less able to borrow in relatively safe waysin their own currencies for exampleand which because of the pandemic were already vulnerable Among 73 low-income countries eligible for debt relief under a g20 initiative eight carry public-debt loads which the imf has deemed to be unsustainable and another 30 are at high risk of falling into such a situation Debt problems in these countries pose little threat to the global economy; together their gdp is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium Yet they are home to nearly 500m people whose fates depend on whether their governments can afford to invest in basic infrastructure and public servicesThen there are the troubled middle-income economies in the mould of Sri Lanka which are more integrated into the global financial system and which through policy missteps and bad luck have found themselves exposed Overall 15 countries are either in default or have sovereign bonds trading at distressed levels They include Egypt El Salvador Pakistan and Tunisia Home discomforts More middle-income countries may be better insulated against deteriorating global conditions than they were in the past Still the imf reckons that about 16% of emerging-market public debt is denominated in foreign currencies And the places that are more insulated have in many cases become so by funding borrowing through local banks That however raises the possibility that any credit stress experienced by a government also feeds through to its banking system which could in turn impair lending or even lead to outright crisis Across the emerging world reckons the imf the share of public debt held by domestic banks has climbed over the past two decades to about 17% of gdp more than twice the level in rich economies Sovereign-debt holdings as a share of total bank assets stand at 26% in Brazil and 29% in India and above 40% in Egypt and PakistanJust how big this group eventually gets and how serious the spillovers are to the rest of the world depends on whether bigger economies like Brazil and Turkey are ensnared by crisis Both have muddled through so far despite some vulnerabilities but poor policy could push them towards the brinkAs a commodity exporter Brazil has benefited from higher food and energy prices Its hefty pile of foreign-exchange reserves has so far reassured markets The president Jair Bolsonaro trails in the polls ahead of an election due in October though and has loosened the country purse strings in an attempt to win support adding to the country heavy debt load He has also suggested that he may not obey voters should they decide to toss him out If he spooks markets an outflow of capital could at the very least leave the economy facing a severe fiscal crunch and recessionTurkey has a dynamic economy and a modest level of public debt But it owes a lot to foreigners relative to its available currency reserves And its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists that the central bank keeps interest rates unduly low in the face of soaring inflationwhich has climbed to near 80% The lira has crashed in value over the past four years Without a policy change the government could face a balance-of-payments crisisNeither of the world largest emerging markets China and India is at high risk of an external crisis Both have intimidating piles of foreign-exchange reserves China government wields close control over both capital flows and the domestic financial system which should allow it to contain panic while India is only minimally reliant on foreign funding Both however carry enormous public-debt loads by historical standards And both matter enough to the global economy that a period of deleveraging that depressed growth and investment could have big knock-on effectsTaken together then 53 low- and middle-income countries are already experiencing debt troubles or are at high risk of doing so Their economic size is modesttheir combined output amounts to 5% of world gdpbut they are home to 14bn people or 18% of the world population see chart 2 And worryingly there are few options available to ward off crisis An end to the war in Ukraine seems a distant prospect A growth rebound in China or elsewhere could be a double-edged sword: it would boost growth but also contribute to inflation leading to further rate rises in the rich worldDebt relief would help Roughly a third of the massive debts owed by middle-income economies in the 1980s was forgiven under a plan put together by Nicholas Brady then America Treasury secretary in 1989 Additional relief was provided to 37 very poor countries through an initiative organised by the imf and World Bank in 1996 The g20 took similar steps during the pandemic first with the Debt Service Suspension Initiative through which more than 70 countries were eligible to defer debt payments and then through the Common Framework which was intended to provide a blueprint for broader reliefYet the framework has failed to gain traction Only three countries have so far sought help under it and none has completed the process Prospects for improving the scheme or for reaching agreement on debt relief have been dimmed by the fact that lending by Paris Club countriesrich economies that have agreed to co-operate in dealing with unsustainable debtshas become less important while loans from private creditors and big emerging markets China in particular have become more so In 2006 Paris Club economies and multilateral bodies accounted for more than 80% of poor countries’ foreign obligations Today they account for less than 60% of poor-country debt Nearly a fifth is owed to China aloneIndeed work by Sebastian Horn and Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute and Carmen Reinhart of Harvard University helps illustrate how massive and murky a force Chinese lending has become They reckon that almost half of China lending abroad is unreported such that their estimates of China claims on foreign governments probably understate the true figures Even so they reckon that from 1998 to 2018 China foreign lending the bulk of which has gone to low- and middle-income economies rose from almost nothing to the equivalent of nearly 2% of world gdp And among the 50 economies most in hock to China obligations to Chinese institutions amount to 15% of gdp on average or about 40% of external debtMore than a third of the world most debt-distressed countries also number among those most indebted to Chinese lenders As of 2017 the debt owed to China by Kenya amounted to 10% of the latter gdp and by Laos a staggering 28% China is also a big creditor of Sri Lanka which owed it the equivalent of 8% of gdp in 2017 and Pakistan 9% Many indebted economies are loth to ask for debt relief from China fearing the wrath of its leadership or a loss of access to future funding and Chinese institutions have tended to prefer reprofiling debts to outright relief Deteriorating relations between China and the West meanwhile have reduced the scope for co-operation in handling debt problems In the 1980s emerging-market defaults on loans owed to American banks pushed some financial institutions to the brink of insolvency Residents of rich economies may take some comfort from the fact that their lenders are less exposed today But for the billion or more people living in countries at risk of distress the pain will be only too drawn out both as fiscal woes infect local banks and as negotiations over external debt prove intractable For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our

quotas stop them increasing exports when prices are high One Western oil trader says that planners have been leaning on state oil firms to sell even less abroad Refiners thus have an incentive to do fewer runs when prices are high and to stockpile crude instead “Export controls are a strategy to keep oil in the country in case there a shortage” says Zhou Xizhou of s&p Global a rating agencyAt present there are no shortages But that does not mean the government supply-side measures have had resounding success A big factor in keeping shortages at bay has been the sorry state of the economy and the muted demand for energy Some economists believe China oil demand could be flat this year compared with last year or even lower Optimistic forecasters see the economy recovering later in the year even as growth slows in America and Europe This could lower global energy prices just as China needs to import moreIf factories come roaring back to life earlier than expected however then China energy policy would face a real test Miners refiners and generators could respond to price caps and export bans by reducing supply A particularly cold winter could force buyers of gas into the spot market where prices have rocketed And officials would start to feel the heat For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 14th 2022,Inflation shows both the value and limits of monetary-policy rules,It was a curious omission In February when the Federal Reserve published the winter edition of its semi-annual report to Congress it dropped a normal section outlining the appropriate level of interest rates as determined by “monetary-policy rules” Its inclusion might have been awkward because it would have suggested that rates should be as high as 9% when the Fed still had them near to 0% In subsequent hearings at least three members of Congress pressed Jerome Powell the Fed chairman to explain its absence Mr Powell promised that the section would be back in its next report And so it was when the summer edition was published on June 17ththough only after the Fed had started to catch up to the rules’ prescriptions by rapidly raising ratesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs controversies go the disappearance of a three-page section in a lengthy policy report was rather minor It garnered scant media coverage Nevertheless it was important It shone light on a decades-old question that is being asked with more insistence amid soaring inflation: should central banks limit their discretion and set interest rates according to black-and-white rules?The search for rules to guide and constrain central banks has a long pedigree It dates back to the 1930s when Henry Simons an American economist argued that authorities should aim to maintain “the constancy” of a predetermined price indexa novel idea in his era In the 1960s Milton Friedman called for central banks to increase the money supply by a set amount every year That monetarist rule was influential until the 1980s when the relationship between money supply and gdp broke downAny discussion of rules today conjures up a seminal paper written in 1993 by John Taylor an economist at Stanford University In it he presented a straightforward equation which came to be known as the “Taylor rule” The only variables were the pace of inflation and the deviation of gdp growth from its trend path Plugging these in produced a recommended policy-rate path which over the late 1980s and early 1990s was almost identical to the actual federal-funds rate the overnight lending rate targeted by the Fed So it seemed to have great explanatory power Mr Taylor argued that his rule might help to steer central banks on the right path for rates in the futureHowever just as the Taylor rule started to get attention from economists and investors alike its explanatory power grew weaker In the late 1990s the recommended Taylor rate was consistently lower than the fed-funds rate That sparked a cottage industry of academic research into alternative rules mostly grounded by Mr Taylor original insights Some put more weight on the gdp gap Others added inertia since central banks take time to adjust rates Another group shifted from current inflation to forecasts trying to account for the lag between policy actions and economic outcomes In its reports the Fed usually mentions five separate rules The appeal of rules lies in their cold neutrality: they are swayed only by numbers not by fallible judgment about the economy Central bankers love saying that their policy decisions are dependent on data In practice they sometimes struggle to listen to the data when their message is unpalatable as it has been with inflation for the past year Central bankers found numerous reasons from the supposedly transitory nature of inflation to the limited recovery in the labour market to delay raising rates But throughout that time the suite of rules cited by the Fed was unambiguous in its verdict: tightening was neededThe rules are however not perfectly neutral Someone first has to construct them deciding which elements to include and what weights to ascribe to them Nor are they as tidy as implied by the convention of calling them “simple monetary-policy rules” They are simple in the sense that they contain relatively few inputs But just as a bunch of simple threads can make for one messy knot so a proliferation of simple rules has made for a baffling array of possibilities For example the Cleveland Fed publishes a quarterly report based on a set of seven rules Its most recent report indicated that interest rates should be anywhere between 06% per a rule focused on inflation forecasts and 87% per the original Taylor rulean uncomfortably wide rangeMoreover each rule is built on top of a foundation of assumptions These typically include estimates of the long-term unemployment rate and of the natural interest rate the theoretical rate that supports maximum output for an economy without stoking inflation Modellers must also settle on which of a range of inflation gauges to use Slight changes in any of these inputscommon during periods of economic fluxcan produce big swings in the rates prescribed by the rules For example an adjusted version of the Taylor rule based on core inflation would have recommended an interest-rate increase of a whopping 22 percentage points over the past two years starting from negative 15% Slavishly following such guidance would make for extreme volatility Average eleganceOne possible solution is to combine multiple rules into a single result The Cleveland Fed does just this constructing a basic median out of the seven rules it tracks Using this as a reference point Mr Powell and his colleagues ought to have started raising rates gingerly in the first quarter of 2021 and should have brought them to roughly 4% today more than twice as high as they actually are That is much more sensible as a recommendation than the conclusion yielded by any single policy ruleSuch a median could never substitute for analysis of a range of data by central banks But there is a big difference between taking rules seriously and treating them as holy writ After all the inflation missteps of the past year a healthy sample of rules deserves a closer look in policy debates And they certainly deserve more prominence than they currently get as a short section in monetary reports that the Fed can choose to omit when inconvenient For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

In order to quantify its uniqueness Buttonwood has examined three measures of market-related uncertainty: expected asset-price volatility divergence in economic forecasts and the unpredictability of economic policy as chronicled in the media The tests suggest we really are living in unusual times Start with swings in asset prices In the past month America s&p 500 stock index has been three times more volatile than it was before the pandemic And investors are still jittery The volatility index vixwhich captures investors’ appetite for insuring themselves against future stock-price moveshas hovered at around 25 points since 2020 nearly eight points above its 2010s average That is not unprecedented however Since the 1990s a range of crises from the Gulf war to the dotcom crash have kept the vix near 25 points for monthsThe bond-market hysteria is more unusual The Merrill Lynch Options Volatility Estimate move is a gauge of fear among bond investors It is at levels last seen in March 2020 when the spread of covid-19 caused market panic although it is still lower than during the 2007-09 financial crisis The elevated move reflects the clumsy pivot in central-bank policy On May 4th Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve signalled it was not even considering raising rates by 075 percentage points at its next meetingbefore doing just that six weeks laterCentral bankers have become hard to read for a reason: the macroeconomic oracles on which they partly rely our second gauge are exceptionally dispersed A measure of disagreement among professional forecasters of economic growth surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed is nearly triple its typical 2010s level; it has been above two percentage points for nine consecutive quarters which last occurred between 1979 and 1981 when inflation was in double digits Our third measure of uncertainty that arising from the inscrutable outlook for economic policy indicates lasting change the most clearly An index built by Scott Baker of the Kellogg School of Management and colleagues tracks the frequency of articles that include worrying bundles of wordssuch as “regulatory” “economic” and “uncertainty”in global publications It suggests that economic-policy unpredictability has been rising steadily since the financial crisis and is now far higher than in the late 1990s when the index began That our indicators are flashing red at the same time suggests an enduring step-up in uncertainty from which it may be hard to climb down Furthermore the different types of uncertainty reinforce each other Political polarisation which tends to make economic policy erratic is fuelled by high inflation All this means the economy is harder to forecast making life harder for central banks in turn spooking investors The fragmentation of global trade doesn’t help The unwinding of supply chains encourages stockpiling during booms and fire-sales during busts amplifying economic swingsPersistent uncertainty means a higher cost of capital and less affordable insurance against shocks All of which tends to dampen business investment weighing on gdp growth and equity returns There have been many dark days for the nasdaq in 2022: the index has already recorded 32 daily falls of more than 2% since January This time their entry on the calendar of doom looks deserved For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Crypto last man standing Jul 9thWhat past market crashes have looked like Jun 30thHow attractively are shares now priced?

 Jul 14th 2022,The ECB masterplan to manipulate markets,Financial markets are supposed to follow a strict division of labour The central bank sets the risk-free rate to stimulate or cool the overall economy but it is “market-neutral”: it does not favour any asset over another Private investors choose who to lend to and at what risk premium Combine the two judgments and the economy should have a set of interest rates that reflects economic conditions Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe European Central Bank ecb however thinks markets are not doing their jobor at least not the way it wants It is preparing to intervene in two novel ways: by limiting what it deems an acceptable difference or spread in rates between sovereign borrowers; and by greening its bond purchases and banking rules In doing so it will abandon market neutrality and discriminate between assetsStart with sovereign spreads On July 21st the ecb is expected to unveil a new tool meant to prevent borrowing costs among euro-zone governments from diverging too much The aim is to ensure that monetary-policy decisions work similarly across the bloc If rising rates say led to ballooning spreads with the extra costs transmitted to private borrowers some regions might feel a bigger squeeze than others The currency union has a history of such divergence During the euro crisis between 2011 and 2015 a bigger spread between sovereigns also meant tighter financial conditions for private firms and households Yet some argue that the ecb mooted tool is not needed today Europe has cleaned up its banks; the ecb has pledged to do whatever it takes to save the euro In the private sector fragmentation is less of an issue: lending rates to firms in Italy are at the level they were before the euro crisis relative to Germany despite widening sovereign spreads Moreover the policy looks tricky to implement The ecb will need to define what counts as an “excessive” spread That is hard because economists do not know what the true justified interest rate is for any given bond The tool could encourage vulnerable countries to borrow at will knowing the ecb is capping their spreads So strings may have to be attached And if it is deemed akin to monetary financing which is barred under the Maastricht treaty it may stumble in the courtsStill the ecb is likely to forge ahead There is an emerging consensus that in a diverse monetary union managing sovereign spreads is part of monetary policy Increasingly the ecb also sees as its duty to curb the financial risks of climate changeits second break away from market neutrality On July 4th the bank said it would “tilt” its corporate-bond buying towards issuers “with better climate performance” The central bank is also making it harder to pledge carbon-intensive assets as collateral for loans from the central bankThe ecb‘s neutrality was always a myth says Pierre Monnin an economist at the Council on Economic Policies a think-tank in Zurich Market-based estimates of risk are inevitably flawed when it comes to climate change because no comprehensive system of carbon pricing exists By failing to correct for unpriced “externalities”harms imposed by borrowers on third partiesthe ecb nominally neutral stance in fact reinforced such inefficiencies Fossil-fuel firms also rely more on bond financing than renewables But although these arguments are economically sound it is not the traditional role of central banks to price externalities when the government has failed to actAnd are the ecb own risk assessments up to the task? One yardstick is the adequacy of its first climate-stress test whose results were published on July 8th These suggest that 41 of Europe biggest banks could together suffer about €70bn in credit and market losses over the next three years in the event of more frequent natural disasters and a disorderly energy transition That is only around 4% of these banks’ aggregate capital and far less than the €400bn of damage the ecb reckons might hit them in an economic downturnYet the ecb itself admits the stress test is only a “learning exercise” rather than an attempt to find out if the banks have a big-enough buffer to withstand climate chaos Most banks do not have enough data to properly estimate climate losses; many lack the tools for incorporating climate risks into lending decisions The ecb‘s first stab at totting up the potential costs of a messy transition is most probably a gross underestimate By dropping market neutrality the central bank is taking a more political role Whether its visible hand ends up bending markets in the right direction is another question For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter 
 Jul 14th 2022,The legacy of Abe Shinzo will shape Japan economy for years,A little less than eight years is not an especially long tenure for heads of government in much of the world In Japan it is a veritable aeon And two years after the resignation of Abe Shinzo a former prime minister who was assassinated on July 8th the reforms he pushed in office look set to shape Japan economy for years to comeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe current prime minister Kishida Fumio secured a big majority of seats in the upper house of Japan legislature in the election on July 10th His greater focus on equality and redistribution which he calls “New Capitalism” was initially cast as an alternative to Mr Abe vision In reality it will be built on the foundations his predecessor laid out The programme which began after Mr Abe 2012 thumping election victorydubbed Abenomicshad three so-called “arrows” to dislodge Japan from its economic stagnation: flexible fiscal policy monetary expansion and structural reforms Clear positives stand out from Mr Abe record most notably the financial accounts of Japan Inc Reforms to corporate governance encouraged more shareholder-friendly activity and prodded firms to reduce moribund networks of cross-shareholdings Those changes paired with a slump in the yen boosted corporate earnings to record levels see chart An environment friendlier to investors also helped to raise anaemic levels of inward foreign direct investment In 2020 direct investment into Japan was worth 12% of gdp the highest on record There have been stark improvements in the labour market too Japan female employment rates previously low by the standards of rich economies climbed rapidly under Mr Abe At 72% among working-age women the employment rate is now more than ten percentage points above the levels Mr Abe inherited and six percentage points above the American equivalent Kathy Matusi the economist who championed increasing female participation as a way to unlock the productive potential of the Japanese economy credits Abe-era reforms such as mandatory disclosure on gender diversity and more generous salary replacements for new parentsMr Kishida aides now talk less of ditching Abenomics and more of building its legacy When his New Capitalism Council revealed its “grand design” document in May it concluded that the strategy would adhere to the three-arrow framework The strategy focuses rightly on the need to get firms to deploy their excess cash through wage increases or capital investments Stagnant wages have been Abenomics biggest shortcoming At around 266000 yen $1940 per month in May Japan average wage has barely budged in a decade and has actually fallen in real terms Most of the recent rise in female employment reflects growth in part-time jobs that are usually poorly paid This is where Mr Kishida could have the most to offer Regrettably his approach to the issue so far differs little from Mr Abe: tax incentives and browbeating with a bit of a boost for public-sector workersFiscal policy was a troubled area for Mr Abe and is likely to remain one for Mr Kishida Two long-planned but ill-fated increases in Japan sales tax in 2014 and 2019 made fiscal policy a drag on the recovery rather than a boost Spending under Mr Abe was not as flexible as the first arrow label would have suggested After leaving office Mr Abe did convince the party to soften its pledge to balance the primary budget excluding debt-servicing costs by 2025 But Mr Kishida is said to be more concerned about fiscal sustainability His closest advisers have backgrounds in Japan typically hawkish finance ministry Mr Abe support for a more stimulative monetary policy has also lasted beyond his tenure with mixed effects Enormous purchases of bonds and a subsequent policy to directly fix the yields of government bonds may have prevented Japan from falling back into deflation but failed to stimulate inflation or nominal-income growth as desired As inflation rises globally the Bank of Japan may find it harder to keep policy easy But Mr Kishida will likely pick a continuity candidate when Kuroda Haruhiko Mr Abe central-bank governor leaves office next AprilWith Mr Abe gone might Mr Kishida feel liberated to diverge further from his predecessor? Different global conditions could fuel such a change Concern about fiscal discipline has more truck in a world of rising interest rates But the differences between Mr Abe and Mr Kishida approach now look more likely to be a matter of degree rather than substance Mr Kishida focus on wages in particular could augment the successes of Abenomics if properly pursued Mr Abe arrows in short will remain essential weapons For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 13th 2022,American inflation tops forecasts yet again adding to recession risks,At this point upside surprises in inflation occur with such frequency that surprise is probably the wrong word for them So it was with America consumer price index cpi for June published on July 13th It soared 91% compared with a year earlier marking yet another four-decade high and beating forecasts for an 88% increase Still investors seemed to be caught unawares with stocks falling sharply after the data adding to this year big losses The pessimism in financial markets is easily understood: persistently high inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to press on with aggressive monetary tightening even at the potential cost of a recessionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAll the more important therefore to understand how persistent inflation will be In this respect the most concerning part of the latest data was not the shocking headline figure about half of which could be attributed to oil and gas prices which surged early in June but have since ebbed Rather it was the change in core prices stripping out volatile food and energyCore inflation rose 07% in June from May the highest month-on-month increase in a year And it was not a blip: over the past three months core inflation has been running at an annualised rate of nearly 8% an indication of the breadth of price pressures see chart Just about everythingfrom cars to clothing and furniture to rentsis getting more expensiveThat reinforces investors’ belief that the Fed will stay on its hawkish path A day before the inflation data bond-market pricing implied that the Fed would raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at its next rate-setting meeting in late July the second straight increase of that size Following the data bond pricing put the chances at roughly 50-50 that it would instead opt for a full percentage point increase Either way it puts the Fed on track for the steepest monetary tightening in a calendar year since 1981 when Paul Volcker was at the central bank helm That is already weighing on economic growthAmerica is hardly alone in struggling with high prices Inflation in the euro area is expected to have risen to 86% in June But the details are different Europe problems are more closely linked to surging gas costs both exacerbating the risk of an imminent recession and perhaps limiting the European Central Bank scope for rate increases That has hurt the euro which has fallen by more than 10% since the start of the year bringing it to parity with the dollar for the first time in two decadesThe White House has tried to put as positive a gloss as possible on the figures Before the data release it drew attention to the recent decline in petrol prices The national average is now about $463 per gallon 5% lower than in June With the price of crude down by even more that does probably set the stage for a lower inflation reading in July Moreover President Joe Biden advisers have noted that an alternative gauge of inflation the personal-consumption-expenditure pce price index which is usually seen as more reliable by the Fed has been more mutedNeither argument is all that reassuring Energy prices have weakened over the past month but with the war in Ukraine dragging on and winter looming they may resume their upward climb before long As for pce inflation it is indeed less extreme than cpi inflation but it is still more than twice as high as the Fed 2% target and rising prices for services such as health care may nudge it higher stillThe best news about inflation is that the Fed tightening is in fact gaining traction in the crucial realm of expectations The Fed cannot solve supply-chain snarls or reduce oil prices Where it can be uniquely effective is in tempering the outlook for prices A basic measure of market expectations for annual inflation over the next five years is now 25% down by more than a percentage point since March In the middle of June a closely watched consumer survey by the University of Michigan put expected annual inflation at 33% for the next five years; by the end of the month it was down to 31% That is precisely what the Fed wants to see Unfortunately economists firms and investors are also busily ratcheting down their expectations for economic growtha consequence the Fed cannot avoid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jul 12th 2022,How higher interest rates will squeeze government budgets,In recent years government debt appeared to matter less and less even as countries borrowed more and more Falling interest rates made debts cheap to service even as they grew to levels that would have seemed dangerous a generation before The pandemic put both trends into overdrive: the rich world borrowed 105% of its gdp in 2020 and another 73% in 2021 even as long-term bond yields plunged Now central banks are raising interest rates to fight inflation and public debt is becoming more burdensome Our calculations show that government budgets will feel a squeeze far more quickly than is commonly understood Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn May America budget officials raised by a third the forecast cumulative interest bill between 2023 and 2027 to 21% of gdp That is lower than forecast before the pandemic but it is already an underestimate Officials optimistically assumed the federal funds rate would peak at 26% in 2024 but markets now expect the rate to exceed 3% in July 2023 In the euro zone as interest rates have risen the premium indebted countries like Italy must pay to borrow has gone up reflecting the danger that their debts may eventually become too onerous to service Britain officials forecast in March that its government would spend 33% of its gdp servicing its national debt in 2022-23 the highest share since 1988-89 For a given cost of borrowing three main factors determine the cost of servicing legacy debts Two are straightforward: the level of debt and the proportion of it whose value is pegged to inflation or prevailing interest rates Britain debt-service costs have risen so sharply for example because an astonishing one-quarter of its debt is inflation-linkedThe third factor is more complex: the maturity of the debt When governments issue long-dated bonds they lock in the prevailing interest rate In 2020 America Treasury issued about $200bn-worth of 30-year debt at yields of less than 15% for example The more long-dated debt the longer it takes for budgets to take a hit when rates rise The most common measure of this protection the weighted average maturity wam of debt can be a source of comfort Britain in particular has a lot of long-dated bonds: the wam of its bonds and treasury bills is about 15 yearsBut measures of maturity can mislead The wam can be skewed upwards by a small number of very long-dated bonds Issuing 40-year debt instead of 20-year debt raises the wam but does not change the speed with which rising interest rates affect budgets over the next few years The Office for Budget Responsibility obr Britain fiscal watchdog has suggested an alternative measure Suppose you line up every pound or dollar a government has borrowed by the date on which the debt matures Halfway along you would find the median maturitythe date by which half the government borrowing would need to be refinanced at higher rates Call it the interest-rate half-life Though Britain wam is 15 years its interest-rate half-life is lower at about ten yearsThere is another complication Central banks in the rich world have implemented huge quantitative-easing programmes qe under which they have bought trillions of dollars worth of government bonds To do so they have minted fresh electronic money known as central-bank reserves These reserves carry a floating rate of interest the adjustment of which is the main tool of monetary policy When rates rise the cost to central banks of paying interest on the ocean of reserves created under qe rises immediately Raising interest rates thus reduces central-bank profits And because those profits typically flow straight into government coffers taxpayers sufferThe effect of qe is therefore the same as if governments had replaced vast amounts of debt for which the interest rate was locked in with debt carrying a floating rate For most of the history of qe this refinancing operation has been highly profitable because bond markets repeatedly forecast interest rates would rise sooner than they did From 2010 to 2021 the Fed remitted over $1trn to America Treasury qe has been particularly lucrative for central banks in euro-zone countries whose long-term debt is risky and therefore carries a high yield National central banks such as the Bank of Italy carry out most of the ecb qe locally bearing the default risk and earning the yield on the bonds of their respective home states while also paying their share of the ecb interest costs Earning the yield on Italian government debt while paying out much less in interest on reserves helped the Bank of Italy to remit profits worth 04% of gdp to the government in 2020As short-term rates rise profits from qe will gradually dry up and could even turn negative In May the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which manages the Fed qe portfolio projected that interest rates one percentage point above what was expected by market participants in March would be enough to turn the portfolio net income negative for a short timea scenario that today looks likely Another percentage point on interest rates would lead to negative net income for two to three years A full accounting of interest-rate sensitivity must thus adjust for the holdings of central banks treating the associated debt as carrying a floating rate of interest Refreshing the obr calculations we find that qe reduces Britain interest-rate half-life to just two years meaning 50% of Britain government liabilities will roll on to new interest rates by late-2024 We have also replicated the exercise for bonds and bills issued by governments in America France Italy and Japan see chart For France and Italy the interest-rate half-life is an estimate The central banks involved disclose which bonds they hold and the wam of their holdings but do not reveal how much they have bought of each bond issuance Our calculations assume they hold a flat proportion of each bond outstanding value which in both cases produces a portfolio whose wam roughly matches the disclosureIn every case the interest-rate half-life is much lower than the reassuring wam Most striking are the results for Japan and Italy which have the highest debts Because the Bank of Japan has replaced nearly half the Japanese bond market with its reserves the interest-rate half-life is vanishingly short Thankfully inflation in Japan is only 25% and expected to fall There is little pressure to raise interest rates The same cannot be said for the euro zone where the ecb is projected to raise rates rapidly so as to tame inflation It is often noted that Italy huge debts of over 150% of gdp at least carry a wam of over seven years But Italy will in fact inherit higher funding costs quickly because its interest-rate half-life is little more than two years Were the ecb policy rates to reach 3% the Bank of Italy share of the interest costs would immediately rise by an annual 12% of gdp Every one percentage point increase in the financing costs on the €462bn of debt net of central banks’ estimated holdings coming due by July 2024 would cost the government another 03% of gdp annually Is there any way for indebted countries to avoid higher interest costs? It might seem tempting to unwind qe faster by selling bonds rather than waiting for them to mature as several central banks are currently doing But selling bonds would cause central banks to book capital losses because rising yields have eroded the value of their bondholdings At the end of March the Fed unaudited financial statements showed an unrealised capital mark-down of $458bn on its qe portfolio since the start of the year; Paul Kupiec and Alex Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tank estimate that the hole has since grown to about $540bnAnother option is to find a way for central banks to pay less interest on reserves A recent report by Frank Van Lerven and Dominic Caddick of the New Economics Foundation a British think-tank calls for them to pay interest on only a sliver of reserves that affects their decision-making rather than the whole lot The ecb and the Bank of Japan already have such a “tiered” system It was designed to protect commercial banks from the negative interest rates they have imposed in recent yearsUsing tiering to avoid paying banks interest while their funding costs went up would be a tax in disguise Banks considered together have no choice but to hold the reserves qe has force-fed into the system Compelling them to do it for nothing would be a form of financial repression which may impair banks’ ability to lend It would “transfer the costs [of rising rates] to the banking sector” Sir Paul Tucker a former deputy governor of the Bank of England told parliament in 2021 A third option is to tolerate high inflation rather than raise rates Despite rising interest costs many countries’ debt-to-gdp ratios will fall this year as inflation eats into the real value of their debts Many prominent economists have argued that an inflation target of 3% or 4% would be better than one of 2% For now the idea is pie-in-the-sky Central banks are too worried about their credibility to switch targets and with good reason: break your promises on inflation once and people may wonder if you will do it again But because making the switch would deliver a one-time fiscal windfall at the expense of long-term bondholders and because inflation can be painful to get down it could eventually appeal to indebted governmentsWhether it is banks taxpayers or bondholders somebody has to pay the bills that are now falling due Soaring interest costs will further squeeze government budgets already under pressure from higher energy costs rising defence spending ageing populations slowing growth and the need to decarbonise With inflation high it is also a bad time to let deficits growa path that might force central banks to raise rates even more For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter

 Jul 7th 2022,Are central banks in emerging markets now less of a slave to the Fed?,In america and Europe central banks turned only recently from encouraging economic recovery to battling stubborn inflation In some emerging markets this shift began much earlier Brazil central bank raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point back in March 2021 15 months before the Federal Reserve did the same It foresaw that fiscal stimulus in the rich world raised the risk of inflation which would upset financial markets and complicate life for emerging economies The governor of Russia central bank Elvira Nabiullina warned over a year ago that the prospect of sustained inflation was likelier “than perceived at first glance” The pandemic had changed spending patterns she pointed out No one knew if the shift would last But that very uncertainty was discouraging firms from investing to meet demandListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThese kinds of comments look prudent and prescient in hindsight Indeed with some notable exceptions central banks in emerging markets have won increased respect in recent years Their monetary-policy frameworks have improved according to a new index based on 225 criteria developed by the imf Their frameworks are more coherent their targets serve sensible objectives transparent they say what they are doing and consistent they do what they say According to calculations by the World Bank expectations of inflation in emerging markets in 2005-18 were about as well-anchored as they had been in rich countries in 1990-2004 Inflation also became less sensitive to falls in the exchange rate Your columnist remembers a sign outside a café in the Malaysian state of Penang in 2015 “Don’t worry!” it said “As our ringgit falls coffee price remains the same”More people expected emerging markets to succeed in their fight against inflation which in turn made success more likely This enhanced credibility raised enticing possibilities Perhaps their central banks like those in the rich world would not need to worry about each depreciation and every inflation spike If so perhaps they could pay less slavish attention to two forces that had bedevilled them in the past: namely the global price of capital which is dictated by the Fed and that of commoditiesWhen the Fed tightens monetary policy trouble has often followed for emerging markets In 2013 for example Ben Bernanke talk about reducing or tapering the pace of the Fed bond-buying sparked the “taper tantrum” a big sell-off in Brazil India Indonesia South Africa and Turkey Things are different in the rich world When the Fed tightens central banks in Britain the euro area and Japan do not feel obliged to raise interest rates Their currencies may fall But unless these depreciations look likely to raise inflation persistently above their targets they are ignored Likewise when the price of oil goes up so does the cost of living Yet consumer prices need not go on rising unless people demand higher wages in response putting further upward pressure on prices in a self-reinforcing spiral In both cases central banks can ignore a one-time increase in prices The more securely inflation expectations are anchored the more leeway central banks enjoy The past year has subjected emerging-market anchors to one severe test after another Global interest rates have risen in anticipation of a faster pace of tightening in America as the Fed wrestles with a credibility test of its own And emerging markets have suffered remorseless increases in the prices of food and fuel which make up more of their consumers’ shopping bills than they do in the rich world According to the World Bank food and energy account for over 60% of South Asia consumer-price indexSome central banks have been able to “look through” the rise in food and fuel prices One example is Thailand central bank which has done nothing even as inflation has surged It insists that “medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored” and it wants to make sure the economic recovery gains traction But other emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil felt compelled to raise interest rates forcefully long before their economies fully recovered They were quicker to respond than their counterparts in mature economies point out Lucila Bonilla and Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics But “that partly because they had to be” Much of their tightening had to keep up with a worrying rise in inflation expectations They have stayed ahead of the curve But the curve has been brutally steep The Fed has been a “somewhat less dominant” force in this emerging-market tightening cycle than in the past note Andrew Tilton and his colleagues at Goldman Sachs Fears of a second taper tantrum have not been realised One reason may be that a lot of footloose foreign capital had already left during the pandemic Moreover some of the countries that might otherwise be vulnerable to Fed tightening especially those in Latin America are also big commodity exporters that have benefited from higher prices for their wares point out Ms Bonilla and Mr Sterne Following the leader The Fed however is far from finished And inflation already rising in emerging markets may become more sensitive to any falls in domestic currencies “It like adding combustible material to a fire” says David Lubin of Citigroup a bank A depreciation may not be enough to ignite inflation But once it is already burning a weaker exchange rate could make it hotter A Malaysian café that is already revising its prices to keep up with costlier commodities may be more likely to factor in a weaker ringgit Much therefore depends on how far the Fed has to go to restore its anti-inflation credentials and contain price pressures in America The harder the Fed must work to meet the test of its own credibility the more trouble emerging markets will face Their hawkish pivot began much earlier than in America but it probably cannot end much sooner This year has reminded emerging markets that for all their progress they are not yet blessed with fully credible central banks It has taught America the same lesson For more expert analysis of the biggest

 Jul 7th 2022,Do cheaper commodities herald a recession?,The war in Ukraine throttled a flow of raw materials that was already being restricted by logistical logjams bad weather and other disruptions The result was soaring prices In March a barrel of Brent crude oil hit $128 and European gas prices were three times higher than they had been just two months earlier Copper a trendsetter for all industrial metals hit a record price of $10845 per tonne Wheat corn and soyabean prices rose by double-digit percentages The surge turbocharged consumer-price inflation which by challenging central banks’ credibility has given them another reason to raise interest rates Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet in recent weeks the wind has changed Oil is trading at around $100 a barrel Copper has dropped below $8000 a tonne for the first time in 18 months; metals in general have fallen by 10-40% since May Agricultural-commodity prices are back at pre-war levels Europe gas prices which have continued to rise as Russia has cut supply are bucking the trend The slide may fuel hopes that inflation will soon be defeated But the victory might prove hollowif there is one at all One explanation for tanking commodity prices is that worries about a recession are taking hold In this view rising interest rates are cooling the market for new homes dampening demand for building materials such as copper and wood and lowering spending on things like clothing appliances and cars which in turn hurts everything from aluminium to zinc Moreover some of the supply constraints that contributed to price rises earlier in the year have easedthe weather in grain-growing regions has improved for instance Meanwhile the un is trying to end a blockade on Ukraine shipments of wheat For central banks this is mixed news It suggests that inflation may be beaten even though they have only just begun tightening monetary policy True this might be accompanied by a recession but because inflation would be tamed without interest rates having to rise too much the downturn would perhaps at least be shallow Worries about the economy are not the only force pushing down prices Much of the money that has fled commodities say industry experts belongs not to physical traders but to financial punters In the week to July 1st about $16bn flowed out of commodity-futures markets bringing the total for the year so far to a record $145bn according to JPMorgan Chase a bank In part that reflects rising interest rates In May America long-dated real rates turned positive for the first time since 2020 That made commodities which do not offer a yield less attractive to speculators This suggests that commodity-price inflation may not have been slayed Movements driven by real-rate swings are usually short-lived says Tom Price of Liberum an investment bank The last time one happened in 2013 prices stabilised within weeks Prices are also still sensitive to further supply disruptions Commodity stocks remain 19% below historical average at a time of tight production meaning there is less of a buffer against shocks Even as some supply problems have eased triggers for others abound Energy prices are still vulnerable to Vladimir Putin whims Pricey energy in turn would cause metals producers to trim output further making production tighter still And the return of La Niña a harsh climate pattern for the third consecutive year could disrupt grain harvests worldwide Prices in other words might stay high even if recession hits For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 6th 2022,America rethinks its strategy for taking on China economy,China is often said to be an area of rare consensus in American politics Just about everyone agrees that something must be done to counter its rise But this appearance of unity masks divisions and even confusion about what exactly needs to be done most of all in the economic domain Is the ultimate goal to open the Chinese market to American businesses or to dissolve commercial bonds with China?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor Joe Biden administration these cross-currents have led to prolonged deliberationsso much so that some critics accuse it of paralysis A seemingly endless debate about whether to remove tariffs on China is the latest example of indecision Slowly though the shape of Mr Biden approach to the Chinese economy is emerging The coming weeks may determine whether it amounts to a resolute coherent strategy or a mess of contradictionsThe narrative is clear enough In a speech in May Antony Blinken America secretary of state boiled down Mr Biden China policy to three words: “invest align compete” That is America should invest in its own strength; align more closely with allies; and confront China where necessary Putting the spin to one side these are in fact good categories for understanding how the Biden administration is trying to deal with China economyStart with competition This took centre-stage under Donald Trump who dragged America away from a lingering desire to “engage” China towards a sharper rivalry with it By the time he left office America average tariff on Chinese products had risen from roughly 3% to nearly 20% according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics see chart 1 The immediate question for Mr Biden is what to do about this inheritanceWith inflation running high Mr Biden wants to lessen price pressures Eliminating tariffs on Chinawhich are in effect a tax on consumerswould in theory help In practice it may make a very small contribution One study from the Peterson Institute estimated that removing the tariffs would shave just 03 percentage points off the annual inflation rate which is now running at more than 8% On the one hand every little counts On the other Mr Biden is loth do something that would be portrayed by Republicans and perhaps China itself as a capitulationEven within his own administration many view the tariffs as precious leverage The most likely outcome will be minor tweaks Mr Trump earlier tariffs went after products such as semiconductors But later levies hit items like shoes hurting consumers more directly Removing tariffs on some consumer products would therefore seem like an easy decision Beyond that opposition to cuts grows steelier “For tariffs on high-tech products or industrial inputs the Biden administration may want to increase these substantially at the same time that it eliminates others It needs to determine which are working and which are not” says Clete Willems a veteran of Mr Trump trade team Hawks welcome the fact that America imports less from China than it did at the start of the trade war see chart 2 The Biden administration has also debated whether to begin a new probe into China economic behaviour Mr Trump big investigation conducted under section 301 of American trade law used to tackle problems not solvable within the wto was focused on China “forced technology transfers” Many in the Biden administration see that as a misdiagnosis The real issue is China broader state capitalism A new 301 investigation could put China industrial plans and subsidies at the forefront of America economic grievances with it Intellectually that would be appealing “The bigger challenge will be is the administration ready to do what a 301 says? Is it ready to impose significant new penalties on China?” says Scott Kennedy of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies a think-tank in Washington The White House delay in announcing a new 301 case despite talk swirling around it for months reveals its hesitancyAnother plank in America competition with China is the battery of economic sanctions rolled out against companies Mr Trump administration blazed the trail placing Chinese industrial champions from Huawei a telecoms giant to dji a dronemaker on the government “entity list” thereby preventing American companies from selling them any items without permission By the end of his term though his methods were increasingly chaotic epitomised by his ill-fated demand that the Chinese owner of TikTok a wildly popular app spin off its American operations see BriefingMr Biden team has worked to place sanctions on a sounder legal footing while also making them more targeted Most of Mr Trump corporate blacklistings are still in place Mr Biden has added to them including barring American investments in a range of Chinese surveillance-tech companies It is also considering new rules to block foreign rivals’ access to Americans’ personal data which may yet ensnare TikTok Taken together the Biden approach looks less like a retreat from Mr Trump brawl with China and more like a professionalisation of itThe second part of Mr Biden strategyalignment with alliessets him much further apart from his predecessor Whereas Mr Trump revelled in scorning America staunchest friends Mr Biden has steadfastly repaired relations The cornerstone of his approach to Asia was unveiled in May with the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ipef tying together countries that represent 40% of global gdp India Japan and Vietnam are part of it and most crucially China is not Another fruit of Mr Biden efforts was a joint statement at the end of the g7 summit on June 28th pledging to “reduce strategic dependencies” on China see China sectionThere are doubts that these fine words will add up to much concrete action The messages shared by several Asian diplomats about the ipef are remarkably similar: it is good to have America back at the table but the only dish on offer is thin gruel The ipef will include discussions about everything from decarbonisation to data sharing but there will be nothing on tariffs a mainstay of traditional trade talks The Biden administration disputes this characterisation One senior official points to the ipef focus on supply chains arguing that it will be meaty With talks starting later this month the official believes that a deal to accelerate port-clearance times could be reached within as little as a yearEven if that comes to fruition there is frustration among many in America and abroad that Mr Biden will not do more on trade A stubborn bipartisan group of politicians in Washington is still agitating for America to re-enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership a regional trade deal from which Mr Trump withdrew Allies such as Japan would love that They believe forging new supply chains is essential to lessening reliance on China For the Biden administration though the idea is a non-starter; it is fearful of alienating union supporters and angering a trade-wary public The unsatisfactory conclusion is that Mr Biden desire to align with allies in its China strategy can only go so far That speaks to the final element of Mr Biden approach: investing at home This is the area where rhetoric and action are furthest apart After all Mr Biden signature spending plan his “Build Back Better” social-and-climate package has not yet made it through Congress It is now crunch time for an initiative that was conceived as a response to China The Senate and House have passed two alternative bills with the same centrepiece: a $52bn plan for bolstering America capacity to produce semiconductors The Senate is more modest and has received bipartisan support The House‘s almost exclusively backed by Democrats contains a hotch-potch of measuresincluding even funding to save coral reefsPeople familiar with talks to bridge the differences say there has been recent progress bringing the unified bill closer to the Senate version One aspect of the House may in reduced form survive: the creation of a mechanism that for the first time would require American companies to notify the government of overseas spending raising the possibility that the White House could block some investments in China For the bill to pass before mid-term elections in November agreement will probably have to be hammered out before Congress breaks for recess for August Even without that bill the Biden administration has tried to set the tone for an investment push at home Mr Trump cajoled and threatened companies to set up factories in America making limited headway Mr Biden big initiative grabbing fewer headlines has been a sprawling review of supply chains In February the government published six separate reports covering semiconductors batteries and more This hardly equates to industrial policy on a Chinese scale But the aim is to channel financing and incentives to strengthen America manufacturing baseThe Biden plan may be pushing at an open door Since the start of his administration companies have announced more than $75bn of investments in semiconductor production and research in America That is in part a response to Mr Biden actions but also a recognition of the fragility of global supply chains Indeed perhaps the most useful policy in weaning companies off the Chinese market is Xi Jinping foolhardy pursuit of “zero covid” which has almost walled off the country If Mr Biden does succeed in boosting domestic manufacturing that victory could well come at the cost of higher prices for consumers reduced efficiency and ultimately lower economic growth True he is rebuilding frayed relationships with allies But in other respects his economic strategy for dealing with China looks a lot like a refinement of the bare-knuckle competition started by Mr Trump For coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jul 5th 2022,Crypto last man standing,Two years ago scarcely anyone in mainstream finance had heard of Sam Bankman-Fried or ftx the cryptocurrency exchange he launched in 2019 Both gained greater prominence first as the crypto craze reached fever pitch and then as crypto fell to Earth Mr Bankman-Fried widely known as sbf has lately been at the centre of attempts to rescue beleaguered crypto firms To some observers the role calls to mind the rescue missions organised by John Pierpont Morgan and America other banking scions in the early 20th century The comparison is surprisingly instructive Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe recent slump has left destruction in its wake Some crypto-lending firms notably Celsius have collapsed; some stablecoins like terra have been obliterated At least one crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has gone bust Estimates of sbf personal wealth have tumbled too from $26bn just over three months ago to nearer $8bn now Nonetheless his companies ftx and Alameda a trading firm seem to be the great survivors of the recent chaos ftx had kept employee numbers relatively low; sbf has said the exchange is still profitable Well-timed funding rounds early this year saw its global and American arms raising $400m each That has enabled sbf to help others in need In June Voyager Digital a broker secured loans worth $485m from Alameda BlockFi another trader has received a revolving line of credit from ftx American armTo some this harks back to America banking panic of 1907 The economy was in recession; towards the end of that year the thinly capitalised Knickerbocker Trust Company one of America largest financial firms at the time collapsed Morgan went on to orchestrate a series of private rescues with other financiers offering deposits in the tens of millions of dollars to various banks in order to prevent runs Those actions are usually credited with preventing a deeper more damaging crisis No other trusts went underAt first glance then the comparison is a flattering one for sbf But 1907 was not the Morgan family only attempt at a big bail-out When the Wall Street crash struck in 1929 JP Morgan junior like his father sought to bring together a gang of plutocrats to stem the tide Several bankers and brokers pledged to buy $125m in stocks equivalent to around 01% of America gdp at the time which would be about $27bn today The plan failed miserably The purchases perhaps pushed out the stockmarket collapse by a few days but did not prevent it from imploding The Dow Jones Industrial Average index of stocks fell by around 35% between early September 1929 and the end of the year By its nadir in 1932 it was almost 90% lower Historians are divided over why one intervention worked but not the other Perhaps the panic in 1929 was too far gone for private purchases to make a difference for instance Other research suggests that the success of 1907 may have been overplayed and that it was action by the Bank of France to calm domestic markets that spilled over to America and halted the mayhem The debate suggests that identifying sbf role in quelling chaos today may be just as hard The trouble could simply continue for a start Indeed on July 5th Voyager filed for bankruptcy A cynic might point out that sbf might be striking deals with other firms not because he wants to rescue the industry but because he has spotted an opportunity to snap up some of his competitors’ operations for pennies on the dollar Some of these attempts may not succeedVoyager owed Alameda $75m when it went underbut others could On July 1st Zac Prince BlockFi chief executive said that its credit line from ftx had been increased to $400m and included an option to acquire BlockFi for up to $240m That looks like a bargain compared with the valuation of $5bn that BlockFi was reportedly seeking during a fundraising round last year Even if sbf is not attempting to save crypto though history remains relevant The panic of 1907 was a proximate reason for the creation of the Federal Reserve and the beginnings of the progressive taxation of income in America as well as an expansion of antitrust law Instead of being hailed as a hero Morgan senior became the focal point for concerns that power was too concentrated in the hands of a small number of financiers Now too there is a possibility that a crash leads to more stringent oversight particularly if the volatility in digital assets spills over to other markets galvanising regulators Boosters may see a JP Morgan in Sam Bankman-Fried and ftx They might come to regret needing oneRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:What past market crashes have looked like Jun 30thHow attractively are shares now priced?

 Jul 3rd 2022,As interest rates climb and the economy cools can companies pay their debts?,Welcome to the American corporate-debt market of 2022 Often the only risky bonds that are being issued are the legacy debts of a now ancient-seeming timewhen interest rates were low and a recession was unthinkable Elsewhere the high-yield market has almost ground to a halt A paltry $83bn of risky debt has been issued so far in 2022 75% less than in the same period last year Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA sharp rise in interest rates this year has cooled credit markets wrong-footed investors and complicated bankers’ lives In January Bank of America Credit Suisse Goldman Sachs and a handful of other lenders agreed to finance a $15bn deal for two private-equity firms to buy Citrix a software firm They promised to issue the riskiest $4bn of that debt at a maximum interest rate of 9% At the time the average yield on bonds with a credit rating of ccc a speculative grade was around 8% The Citrix deal is expected to close this month But the yield on ccc-rated bonds has soared above 14% Should the bankers be unable to sell the debt below the interest-rate cap they will be on the hook for the difference “If the market is anything like it is today they are going to lose hundreds of millionsand potentially a billiondollars on this deal alone” says Roberta Goss of Pretium a debt-investment manager Such potential losses offer a glimpse of the impact that higher rates are having on company borrowing in America Bankers stand to make losses on the $80bn of buy-out financing they have agreed to facilitate for deals that are yet to close That will weigh both on their profits and their willingness to lend Companies are also going to suffer; the only question is how much A steady fall in interest rates over the past 30 years encouraged firms to borrow record amounts Now the cost of servicing and refinancing that debt is climbing profits are being dented by rising costs and inventories are piling up at some firms as demand slows Does a corporate-debt meltdown loom?America last big debt crisis in 2007-09 was in housing The stock of household debt relative to gdp had jumped as lenders aggressively issued mortgages and property prices soared When interest rates rose borrowers began to default Some 3m households were eventually foreclosed on in 2008 This time it seems far less likely that households will be the borrowers struggling Lending standards have been tightened and debt levels have fallen Household debt to gdp peaked at 99% in 2008 but has since tumbled to 75% By contrast corporate debt as a share of gdp at around 80% has been at or near record highs over the past two years see chart 1 To understand where problems might arise it is important to look across the funding options available to firms and their owners American companies owe around $122trn Some $67trn of that is in bonds mostly issued by large or mid-size public firms Another $12trn is loans from banks and $11trn is mortgage debt The restover $3trnis financing from non-banks made up mostly of either private credit typically loans made for private-equity buy-outs or “syndicated” loans which originate in banks but are split into pieces and sold to investors or sometimes bundled into other debt securities The bond market as the biggest source of debt might seem like the natural place to look for trouble But firms that issued bonds are “relative winners” of the rise in interest rates says Eric Beinstein of JPMorgan Chase a bank because most of them pay fixed coupons Of the $5trn-worth of corporate bonds issued since the start of 2020 some 87% pay fixed coupons And those rates are at all-time lows The average coupon on an investment-grade bond is just 36%half the rate in the early 2000s and still below the level in 2019 That will insulate borrowers as rates rise These fixed-rate bonds are not due to mature soon either The high-yield end of the marketthe roughly $18trn owed by sub-investment-grade issuers which tend to be smaller or heavily indebted companiessaw a wave of refinancing in 2020 and 2021 The result is that only a tiny $73bn-worth of high-yield bonds are due to mature in 2022 and 2023 The peak of risky-bond maturation will not come until 2029The impact of rising rates is likely to be much greater in the syndicated-loan and private-debt markets which typically issue floating-rate debt though some of that rate risk may have been hedged They have also seen explosive growth Between 2015 and 2021 the value of outstanding high-yield bonds rose by 15% By contrast leveraged loans a risky subset of syndicated loans grew by around 50% Private credit has more than doubled in size see chart 2 John Kline of New Mountain a private-credit firm argues that the growing market share of private credit is a reflection of the fact that it offers issuers price certainty and is “much easier to deal with” than slicing up a bank loan through a syndication process or issuing a bond He points out that the barbarian days of private-equity shops leveraging firms at debt-to-total-value ratios of 85% are long gone The average debt-to-value ratio for private-equity deals last year was closer to 50%Still that ratio is less reassuring once you consider how far private-equity valuations might have fallen this year the formal figures are revised infrequently unlike public-market valuations And with growth seems to have come fresh risk Compared with the earnings of the firms they bought debt levels look much higher: equal to an average of six times gross operating profit a little higher than the record set in 2019 or in any of the past 20 years “Whenever a market grows quickly there can be a sort of reckoning if the environment changes” says Mr Beinstein The challenge he adds is getting hold of any details or data on private deals In the bright lights of public markets it is easy enough to find evidence suggesting that companies do not face an imminent crisis The problem is that a chunk of the debt lurks in the shadows For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,The allure of betting on mergers,Big deals rarely happen without big personalities If Elon Musk were an uninteresting tycoon with a low public profile and a puritanical approach to promises then shares in Twitter a social-media platform would be trading within a whisker of his $5420 per share offer The difference or “spread” between this offer and Twitter current trading price of below $40 is a reminder that he is not Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe wider the spread the lower the chance investors assign to a deal completing To Mr Musk and Twitter management the spread is a live opinion poll in a fractious situation But to a group of specialised hedge-fund managers it is their bread and butter Merger arbitrage also known as risk arbitrage involves purchasing the shares of a target firm during the risky interval between a deal announcement and its completion The arbitrager first identifies a merger that the market is relatively gloomy aboutie a spread that they believe overestimates the chance of a deal failure Then they buy shares in the company and wait until the deal closes and the acquirer pays the offered price per share The amount of capital dedicated to this strategy has quadrupled during the past decade to more than $100bn despite some patchy returns For several reasons its star will continue to rise For a start big deals are in plentiful supply It is no coincidence that this strategy came of age during America buyout boom of the 1980s After a white-hot 2021 more than 50 deals with a value exceeding $5bn have been announced so far this year Companies’ balance-sheets are stocked with cash and tumbling valuations have created bargains The arbitragers are not yet seeing any signs of recession The deals themselves also need to have some controversy associated with them Ideally someone should be trying and failing to kill them Here lies another tailwind: that regulators are in an interventionist mood Corporate synergies are coming up against national-security and antitrust concerns Shares in Avast a Czech cyber-security firm were edging towards the price offered by NortonLifeLock its bigger American competitor before Britain Competition and Markets Authority said it was taking a closer look at the deal in March More than $1bn was wiped off the market value of a firm that was being bought for around $8bn Arbitragers were not far behind: around a quarter of Avast stock is currently in the hands of hedge funds that bought only after the deal was announced Warren Buffett a celebrated investor who became an active and successful arbitrager early in his career is returning to the action In January Microsoft announced a blockbuster takeover of Activision Blizzard a video-game developer A gaping spread cause by internal strife and competition worries was enough to tempt Berkshire Hathaway the conglomerate run by Mr Buffett to increase its stake in the game-maker to nearly 10% Mr Buffett was already a shareholder But some arbitragers have been known to screen investments by hiring translators lawyers and even courtroom spies The final bump comes from rising interest rates Spreads are widened by an increase in the risk-free rate since investors demand a higher rate of return for holding shares; those piling their capital into merger-arbitrage funds salivate at the thought of inflation-proof returns largely uncorrelated with the wider stockmarket The catch is that not every merger is completed “If the deal goes through we make some money And if the deal doesn’t go through who knows what happens” ruminated Mr Buffett recently The “who knows” part is also now more complicated The price shares would trade at following a deal collapse a crucial determinant of the risk-reward calculation for an arbitrage strategy becomes harder to assess when markets are volatile and valuations uncertain But arbitragers have at least been given a heady cocktail of dealmaking corporate complexity and rising rates For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,The case for strong and silent central banks,Late on june 13th a curious article appeared in the Wall Street Journal It said that the Federal Reserve was “likely to consider” raising interest rates by 075 percentage points at its meeting on June 15th The article was unusually silent about its sources And it proved uncannily prescient Two days later the Fed did indeed raise interest rates by that amount its biggest increase in 28 years Many investors believe the central bank had used the press to warn financial markets about what it would do in advance albeit not very far in advance That would make the Journal story an unconventional example of “forward guidance”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCentral banks often telegraph what they might do before they do it This kind of forward guidance is as old as central banking itself according to Willem Buiter a former rate-setter at the Bank of England It is certainly as old as inflation targeting The Reserve Bank of New Zealand which was the first to adopt a formal inflation target in 1990 quickly learned that it could move markets with its utterances what it called “open-mouth operations” It now publicly forecasts its own decisions If you want to know where it thinks its policy interest rate will be in the future you do not have to look out for mysteriously sourced stories in the press You can just download the central bank spreadsheetThis kind of guidance is intended as no more than a prediction based on the central bank fallible forecasts of the economy It is sometimes called “Delphic” guidance after the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece If the economy defies the forecast as it usually does the central bank may well defy its prophecy of its own behaviour In a paper published in 2012 Jeffrey Campbell then of the Chicago Fed and his co-authors distinguished Delphic forward guidance from another kind “Odyssean” Odyssean guidance is more than just a prediction It includes a promise or commitment of some kind Central bankers use it to tie their own hands like Odysseus lashing himself to the mast of his ship Why would they do that? The aim as the paper put it is to change public expectations about what central banks will do tomorrow so as to improve the economy today In a slump a central bank might not have room to cut short-term interest rates by enough to revive the economy Rates cannot easily be cut below zero It might then promise to keep rates low for longer than it otherwise would even after hearing the siren call of an economic recovery If its promise is believed expectations of inflation will rise That will magically reduce the real cost of borrowing even when the central bank policy rate can fall no further Odyssean language crept into central-bank guidance after the financial crisis of 2007-09 In April 2009 for example the Bank of Canada promised with some qualifications not to raise interest rates for 14 months In 2016 the Bank of Japan said it would keep easing until inflation had durably overshot its 2% target Similar commitments were made in the pandemic When a central bank is stuck close to the zero lower bound it can at least say what it will door refrain from doingwhen economic conditions warrant it moving again Its words speak louder than inactionBut when a central bank is not so constrained the case for Odyssean forward guidance becomes less clear If a central bank is free to act why rely on words rather than deeds? In particular why bother with forward guidance during a tightening cycle? There is after all no upper bound on interest rates That question was recently posed on Twitter by Jason Furman a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers If the central bank knows that interest rates should be higher in the future there is nothing to stop it raising them now Indeed it could increase them up to the point where it is no longer sure if the next move should be up or down In 2004 Ben Bernanke a former chairman of the Fed called this the “bang bang” approach If a central bank were to adopt it it would have little need to offer advance guidance about its future actions because everything it is committed to do it would have done already In one goOne reason why central banks nonetheless like to offer guidance is precisely because they dislike the bang-bang approach They prefer to change interest rates in small increments Forward guidance allows them to move gradually while signalling that the first small step will not be the only one But if investors heed the guidance the future steps will be priced in to longer-term interest rates straight away Thus gradual moves in the policy rate can be accompanied by big swings in broader financial conditionsIn principle a central bank could abandon gradualism while still offering non-binding forecasts of what it might do in the future But such Delphic utterances can be more trouble than they are worth Financial markets often treat them as promises not predictions “People don’t hear the caveats that well” says Mr Furman Knowing this central banks may feel unduly constrained by their past prophecies That can make it harder than necessary to adjust when their predictions inevitably go awry The Fed found itself in precisely such a predicament on June 10th when surprisingly bad consumer-price inflation figures invalidated its recent prediction that it would raise interest rates by no more than half a percentage point at a timeThe strong silent type of monetary policyMarkets react badly when they think a central bank has broken a promise That may add to volatility in itself It may also erode the central bank credibility so that when it does need to make a commitment its words are no longer believed Because promises are hard to keep a central bank should make no more than necessaryThe Fed could not adopt a closed-mouth monetary policy overnight Mr Furman points out Preparing markets for such a shift would take time But the Fed could start considering it for its next tightening cycle Even better he jokes perhaps a pioneer like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could try it for a year first Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:People inflation expectations are risingand will be hard to bring down Jul 25thThe Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession Jun 16thA focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,What past market crashes have looked like,Looking back it is easy to think of stockmarket crashes as abrupt shocks And some of the most dramatic of them were indeed abrupt At the onset of the covid-19 pandemic the s&p 500 index of American stocks plummeted by 34% in a little over a month The last time Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998 the index took six weeks to travel from zenith to nadir nearly taking Long-Term Capital Management and the rest of Wall Street with it Quickest of all was the lightning bolt of October 19th 1987 or “Black Monday” which wiped 20% off the market in a single dayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe biggest downturns though have tended to be much more drawn-out affairs The bloodbath in equities that accompanied the financial crisis of 2007-09 was no single vertiginous plunge: it played out over 17 months Talk of the dotcom bubble “bursting” in the early 2000s can obscure the fact that the journey from peak to trough took two and a half years The greatest crash of all beginning in 1929 took nearly three years to run its courseIn each case losing streaks were interspersed by rallies lasting weeks and fitful days when not much of anything happened If not quite months of boredom punctuated by moments of terror they were long uncertain slogs Today six months after America equity market started falling in the face of persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy another slog might lie ahead But when the bottom finally arrives what will it look like?Like a bubble capitulationinvestors’ jargon for the final frenzied phase of a routis accompanied by a kind of mania It is the part of the crash when something snaps in the collective consciousness and everyone who is going to give up and sell does Perhaps they are retail investors who kept their nerve after losing a third of their capital but seeing another 20% of value vanish conclude that it really might go to zero and rush to the exit Perhaps they are professionals who know full well it a bad time to sell but can’t get their risk manager or their clients off their back Either way it is the violence of the shake-out itself that creates the market bottom: those who refuse to sell at the height of the panic are unlikely to lose their cool further down the line After the frenzy is over prices start to climb againSo much for recognising capitulation in hindsight Spotting it as it happens is harder Perhaps some clues can be gleaned from how historical crashes have played out Start with the crudest measures: the length of the crash and the size of the drop from peak to trough Excluding this year the s&p 500 has notched up 14 bear marketsfalls of more than 20% compared with a recent peaksince the second world war The average downturn took a little over 11 months and resulted in a decline of more than 32% Both measures suggest that this year losses which hit 23% in June before rebounding a little may have some way yet to run For a more granular picture consider the rout in March 2020 One lesson from it is that trading volumes spike as the market plummets Towards the end of the crash shares in the s&p 500 were changing hands at more than double their average rate in the weeks running up to it Volumes for stocks in Britain ftse 100 tripled Another signal is that a large proportion of stocks in an index plunge in value While the downturn in 2020 was at first led by a handful of stocks by the last phase pretty much everything was flashing red True capitulation is reached when contagion spreads not just from one stock to another but across indices and asset classes Set against those measures this year bear market is yet to reach its culmination Investors are gloomy but not so much that they have sold their favourite risky assets Downward lurches have begun to include defensive stocks but many of those in sectors including pharmaceuticals and telecoms are still up on the year And the drops do not yet smack of panic: the s&p 500 worst day this year was its 39th-worst since the turn of the century Trading volumes for the most part suggest a market that is just about holding its nerveIf capitulation is tricky to pinpoint as it arrives profiting from it is harder still How many prices need to be plummeting in lockstep before it becomes time to buy?

 Jun 30th 2022,The latest desperate attempt to prop up the Turkish lira,In turkey the abnormal is the new normal If official figures are to be believed annual inflation now exceeds 73% If Turkish consumers are to be believed it is much higher Measured against the dollar the lira resembles a black-diamond ski slope The currency has lost a fifth of its value against the greenback since the start of the year The obvious solution would be a dramatic increase in interest rates But the country president Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses to allow the central bank to tighten monetary policyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe shock value of the zany economic theory Turkey leader has peddled for some time namely that the solution to high inflation is low interest rates has worn off What has investors and Turkish companies spooked now are the lengths to which Mr Erdogan may go to keep the current monetary settings in place The spectre of capital controls has begun to loom over the country On June 23rd the central bank decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the sixth month in a row That much was expected The surprise came the next day courtesy of Turkey banking authority known as the bddk Turkish companies it ruled would no longer be eligible for loans in lira if their foreign-currency holdings exceeded 15m lira roughly $900000 and if the amount exceeded a tenth of their assets or yearly salesBy forcing companies to sell dollars and euros the government hopes to breathe some life into the lira Turkish exporters already have to convert 40% of their foreign revenues according to an earlier decision made by regulators But the move may also hamstring companies and trigger capital outflows The more the government penalises foreign-currency holdings the less able firms are to protect their savings against inflation undermining confidence They will also find it harder to buy goods and services from abroad Some will look for ways to circumvent the new directive says Durmus Yilmaz a former governor of the central bank and will park more money abroadTurkey increasingly unorthodox attempts to support the lira have already taken a heavy toll on the economy and the public finances Since 2019 the central bank has burned through at least $165bn in foreign reserves by intervening in currency markets Late last year the government unveiled a scheme to compensate holders of special lira deposits for the currency depreciation against the dollar in an attempt to stop a further lurch Turks have since poured 963bn lira into the special accounts Because the currency has nonetheless continued to slide the treasury owes them billions of dollars The government latest move does not meet the textbook definition of capital controls measures to stem the flow of foreign capital into and out of the country But it suggests more severe interventions might be in store if the lira continues to plummet Analysts say Mr Erdogan would much sooner impose capital controls than allow rate increases “I’m 100% sure he will not use interest rates as a tool” says Ozlem Derici Sengul of Spinn a consultancy in Istanbul The country is sliding down a slippery slope For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,Inflation in America soars to 8% Or is it more like 6%?,The federal reserve “preferred measure of inflation” is a phrase that often crops up in reporting on the American economy It stands in for a verbose official name: the personal-consumption-expenditures price index pcepi Most discussion of inflation however focuses on its better-known and pithier relative the consumer-price index cpiListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat usually does not matter much But the gap between cpi and pcepi has recently widened hitting 23 percentage points in May the largest divergence since 1981 So while headlines blare out that cpi inflation is running at more than 8% annually it is just over 6% in the pcepi world To be sure the lower pcepi figure is not cause for celebration Just like cpi it is also at a four-decade high But it is nonetheless instructive to consider why the gap has grown so wide The simple explanation is weighting Housing for instance is 33% of cpi but just 16% of pcepi Petrol also has a slightly higher share in cpi The pcepi gauge is broader encompassing things purchased on behalf of consumers such as medical care even if paid for by the government or an employer When rents and oil prices soar cpi inflation tends to outstrip pcepi inflation The Fed prefers pcepi because it reflects how money is actually spent If people stop buying expensive cars and spend more on bus tickets that shift shows up in pcepi; cpi by contrast just registers the higher car prices “cpi doesn’t allow for immediate substitution which exacerbates the divergence” says Julie Smith of Lafayette College In theory that might tempt the Fed to highlight pcepi now The latest figures out on June 30th showed that core pcepi excluding food and energy rose by 03% in May compared with April slower than the 06% jump in cpi But Jerome Powell the Fed chairman instead highlighted cpi when explaining the central bank jumbo interest-rate rise on June 15th Partly that is because cpi was published just before its decision The fact that cpi is more widely discussed even if less accurate also recommends it The central bank concern is that inflation expectations are becoming unmoored If people pay more attention to cpi the Fed will feel obliged to do so too For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,Can Europe keep the lights on this winter?,Europe energy war is becoming total Having already banned or promised to ban imports of Russian oil leaders of the g7 group of countries said on June 28th that they would explore ways to cap its price as well as that of Russian gas Populations are being prepared for pain Britain has hinted that it will reform its power market to curb the influence of natural gas on domestic prices French utilities have called on consumers to cut energy use “immediately” One goal of such manoeuvres is to deprive Russia of much-needed revenue Another is to try to ward off the energy crunch that looms over Europe Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOnly a month ago it looked like a crisis might be avoidedjust As America cranked up its exports of liquefied natural gas lng its share of Europe total gas imports rose from 6% in September to 15% in May even as Russia slumped from 40% to 24% What gas Europe needed from its troublesome neighbour still flowed Russia did turn off the taps to Bulgaria Finland and Poland after they refused to pay in roubles as it had demanded but they bought little in the first place The continent reserves were building up at a record paceThen two things happened On June 8th a fire shut down the Freeport gas-liquefaction facility in Texas The outage which is expected to last 90 days has deprived Europe of 25% of its gas supply A week later Gazprom a Russian energy giant said that supply to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would fall to just 40% of capacity ostensibly because of the delayed return of a turbine being serviced in Canada Gazprom blames sanctions That took another 75% off Europe supply There are few other sources lng terminals are running at full tilt Little more can flow through pipelines from Algeria Azerbaijan or Norway Restarting the Dutch gas field of Groningen which once supplied as much as Nord Stream but was phased out after causing earthquakes is politically tricky The result reckons Rystad Energy a consultancy is that the eu gas-storage facilities will be two-thirds full by the end of October short of the bloc target of four-fifths There is even a fear that Nord Stream which is due for regular servicing in July will not restart once the maintenance ends If so Europe may enter the winter with storage levels at just 60% That raises questions about the continent ability to stay warm this winter Moreover gas-fired power generation has become the marginal source of electricity supply over the past year in western Europe implying that its cost is what sets power prices across the region Last year this was partly because renewable-power generation was hampered by droughts and thus feeble rivers and insufficiently strong winds This time the problem is that nuclear reactors in France require maintenance and are running at less than half their capacity That is draining Europe power supplyjust as a heatwave in the south is boosting demand for cooling France spot power prices averaged €197 $206 per megawatt-hour in May compared with €15 a year ago One way Europe copes with imbalances is through trade France once the region largest exporter of power is now buying electricity from its neighbours Wholesale gas is now dearer in Germany and eastern Europe because of the reduction of supply through Nord Stream see chart That will incentivise flows from Britain and Spain which have lng terminals But it will not increase the aggregate supply of fuel and power And there are signs that in a crunch unity could fray On June 29th it emerged that one of Britain first steps in an emergency would be to cut off gas to mainland Europe eu countries are thus scrambling to find alternatives to gas Germany has reversed plans to retire more than one-fifth of its coal-fired power stations this year Austria Britain France and the Netherlands have said they may either delay closures of or reopen coal plants Some of the seven European nuclear plants that are due to be shut by the end of winter may also be kept operating a bit longer Yet even if all of this is done gas will probably continue to set electricity prices A futures contract for Germany “baseload” ie non-renewable power in December currently trades at 25% above gas-fired power-generation costs suggesting that the market is pricing in a gas crunch plus a premium A persistent supply shortfall means demand will have to adjust High prices might do part of the job But rationing may also have to be imposed on gas- and power-hungry companies such as producers of fertiliser glass and steel How drastic those curbs are and whether they end up being extended to households will in turn depend on two wild cards: winter temperatures on the continent;

 Jun 29th 2022,The battle between Asia financial centres is heating up,“Another one!” was how a Singaporean manager of serviced apartments greeted your correspondent fresh off the plane from Hong Kong The response tells you which of the two cities is currently enjoying an influx of people and business The latest impetus has been their contrasting approaches to the pandemic Singapore began opening up to the rest of the world last year; by comparison although the quarantine periods for arrivals to China and Hong Kong have been shortened there is no sign yet of their end Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHong Kong is widely seen as the third-most-important city for global finance and business after New York and London and ahead of Shanghai and Singapore Most historians trace its rise as a financial centre to the early 1970s when it became a hub for Asian offshore financing Its importance then increased dramatically after China began to open up under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 Hong Kong was where Western bankers could mingle with Chinese businessmen while private-sector activity in the mainland was still finding its feet The deals they made were governed by the territory reliable regulatory framework and courts that made use of English law Yet even before the pandemic the established order of Asia global hubs was being thrown into doubt Over the quarter-century since Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty the mainland has tightened its grip on the territory institutions Under its influence Hong Kong has introduced a sinister national-security law; the city independent judiciary long valued by foreign investors has been weakened by political intervention That has tarnished its appeal relative to Singapore another entrepot with a common-law legal system business-friendly regulation and low taxes Moreover South-East Asia has become an increasingly desirable place for Western companies to do business which by virtue of proximity further burnishes Singapore allure For firms intending to operate in China meanwhile the benefits of setting up in Hong Kong rather than Shanghai are diminishing How will the roles of these cities evolve in the face of such forces? To answer the question consider three measures of the importance of a city for global business and finance: its use as a base for conducting regional or global business; its position as a centre for wealth made elsewhere to be managed and invested; and the size of its capital market and the banking activities associated with itStart with where business is Hong Kong status as a regional base for global firms was always tied to China but that relationship has become more intimate still in recent years The number of Chinese firms with regional headquarters in the territory has doubled since 2015 even as the number of American firms using the city as a base for their Asian or greater China operations has steadily declined see chartSingapore does not produce similar statistics but a flurry of recent openings by big firms is illustrative Sony Music an American entertainment company; Dyson a British home-appliance maker; and VinFast a Vietnamese maker of electric vehicles have all set up regional or global headquarters there in recent years Chinese tech firms including Alibaba TikTok and Tencent have done so too led by their need to be outside China “great firewall” in order to run their global operationsSingapore has publicly been ambivalent about stealing business from Hong Kong Lee Hsien Loong the city-state prime minister has welcomed expats but said that he would be just as happy if they felt able to remain in Hong Kong contributing to the region dynamism In the background however the approach is less magnanimous The city sharp-elbowed investment-promotion agency works to help would-be migrants with visas and business registrations Shanghai had attracted Western outposts before the pandemic Some firms such as Coca-Cola had moved their Asia headquarters there from Hong Kong Regulatory changes in 2020 allowed foreign investment banks to run majority-controlled businesses in China Several have consequently expanded their operations in Beijing and Shanghai Foreign asset managers including Amundi and BlackRock have also scaled up their onshore presence The city grim lockdowns may have cooled that ardour in the near term In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai only one American firm out of 133 planned to increase its investment in China Yet for firms intending to have some exposure to the mainland Shanghai may ultimately prove unavoidable The more Hong Kong comes under China thumb the less unattractive being based on the mainland becomes China may be more draconian in its approach both to governance and covid-19 but it is at least home to vast numbers of suppliers and customers “If you want to be in China it will be increasingly important to be onshore and close to your clients and companies” says Christian Brun of Wellesley an executive-recruitment firm for the financial-services industry Mr Brun predicts job growth on the mainland and in Singapore with fewer roles for expats in particular in Hong Kong He himself has moved from Hong Kong to SingaporeA second gauge of the cities’ relative dominance is wealth management It is here that the competition between Hong Kong and Singapore has been fiercest By one measure Hong Kong pot of assets under management and fund advisory rose from nearly $13trn in 2010 to more than $3trn in 2020 But a comparable measure for Singapore shot up from around $1trn to $34trn with the city overtaking Hong Kong as long ago as 2017 Its simple laws for establishing trusts and its tax efficiency have attracted wealth to it A new form of investment vehicle launched in 2020 the variable-capital company has also proved popular with fund managers Hong Kong has been squeezed in other areas of investment management too Of the 20 largest managers of venture-capital funds globally measured by capital raised in the past decade seven were in Beijing Shanghai or Shenzhen Venture capitalists hoping to cash in on South-East Asia boom have chosen Singapore as a base The city closer links with Indian firms are also an attractionWhen it comes to capital markets and investment banking our third gauge of the cities’ importance though Hong Kong retains its crown With China government showing no sign of allowing capital to flow freely in and out of the mainland soon the territory value as a gateway remains It hosts the Connect programmes that allow foreign investors to trade onshore bonds and equities and Chinese punters to trade stocks in the territory Three-quarters of all transactions in yuan made through the swift interbank-messaging system are booked in Hong Kong The territory has been a hub for Chinese firms to list in recent years including Alibaba and jdcom in 2019 and 2020 though few have come this year Overall the value of the city listed stocks runs to nearly $5trn compared with $7trn in Shanghai and $700bn in Singapore That in turn has helped Hong Kong sustain an edge in global banking even though some desks have moved to Singapore to skirt the territory quarantine rules Hong Kong then will remain a route to investing in China But it may be less likely to attract other sorts of new business The companies that do move there are more likely to be Chinese To others Hong Kong delay in reopening seems to typify its indifferent approach to its global status Faced with it firms seeking to do business in Asia more broadly may choose Singapore And those wanting to do business in China may expand their presence onshore instead Where Hong Kong alone used to suffice some firms may start to see a Shanghai-and-Singapore strategywhich uses the first for operations in China and the second for those in the rest of Asiaas an attractive long-term bet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 26th 2022,Why inflation looks likely to stay above the pre-pandemic norm,The bad news on inflation just keeps coming At more than 9% year on year across the rich world it has not been this high since the 1980sand there have never been so many “inflation surprises” where the data have come in higher than economists’ forecasts see chart This in turn is taking a heavy toll on the economy and financial markets Central banks are raising interest rates and ending bond-buying schemes crushing equities Consumer confidence in many places is now even lower than it was in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic “Real-time” indicators of everything from housing activity to manufacturing output suggest that economic growth is slowing sharplyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhat consumer prices do next is therefore one of the most important questions for the global economy Many forecasters expect that annual inflation will soon ebb in part because of last year sharp increases in commodity prices falling out of the year-on-year comparison In its latest economic projections the Federal Reserve for instance expects annual inflation in America as measured by the personal-consumption-expenditures index to fall from 52% at the end of this year to 26% by the end of 2023You might be forgiven for not taking these prognostications too seriously After all most economists failed to see the inflationary surge coming and then wrongly predicted it would quickly fade In a paper published in May Jeremy Rudd of the Fed made a provocative point: “Our understanding of how the economy worksas well as our ability to predict the effects of shocks and policy actionsis in my view no better today than it was in the 1960s” The future path of inflation is to a great extent shrouded in uncertainty Indeed some indicators point to more price pressure to come in the near term Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy runs millions of news articles in several languages through a model to construct a “news inflation pressure index” The results which are more timely than the official inflation figures measure not just how frequently price pressures are mentioned but also whether the news flow suggests they are building up In both America and the euro area the index is still well above 50 indicating that pressures are continuing to accumulate Inflation worrywarts can point to three other indicators suggesting that the rich world is unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic norm of low stable price growth any time soon: rising wage growth and increases in the inflation expectations of both consumers and companies If sustained these could together contribute to what the Bank for International Settlements the central bank for central banks described in a report published on June 26th as a “tipping point” Beyond it warned the bis “an inflationary psychology” could spread and become “entrenched” Evidence is mounting that workers are starting to bargain for higher wages This could create another round of price increases as firms pass on the extra costs A survey by the Bank of Spain suggests that half of collective-bargaining deals signed for 2023 contain “indexation clauses” meaning that salaries are automatically tied to inflation up from a fifth before the pandemic In Germany ig Metall a trade union has asked for a 7-8% pay rise for nearly 4m workers in the metals and engineering sector it will probably get about half that In Britain rail workers went on strike as they sought a rise of 7% though it is unclear whether they will succeed All this will make wage growth hotter still Already a tracker for the g10 group of countries compiled by Goldman Sachs a bank is rising almost vertically A measure of pay pressure from Alternative Macro Signals is similarly animated And wage floors are rising too The Netherlands is bringing forward an uplift to the minimum wage; earlier this month Germany passed a bill increasing its minimum by one-fifth Australia industrial-relations agency has raised the wage floor by 52% more than double last year increase Faster wage growth in part reflects the public higher expectations for future price risesthe second reason to worry that inflation might prove sticky In America near-term expectations are rising fast The average Canadian says they are braced for inflation of 7% over the next year the highest figure of any rich country Even in Japan the land where prices only rarely change beliefs are shifting A year ago a survey by the central bank found that just 8% of people believed that prices would go up “significantly” over the next year consumer prices indeed rose by only 25% in the year to April Now however 20% of people reckon that will happen The third factor relates to companies’ expectations Retailers’ inflation expectations are at an all-time high in a third of eu countries A survey by the Bank of England suggests that clothes prices for Britain autumn and winter collections will be 7-10% higher than a year ago The Dallas Fed does find tentative evidence that customers are less willing to tolerate price increases than before; a respondent in the rental and leasing business complained that “it is getting tougher to pass on the 20-30% price increases we have received from manufacturers” But that merely points to a lower level of high inflation The big hope for lower inflation relates to the price of goods Fast increases in the prices of cars fridges and the like linked in part to supply-chain snarls drove the initial inflationary surge last year Now there is some evidence of a reversal The cost of shipping something from Shanghai to Los Angeles has fallen by a quarter since early March In recent months many retailers spent big on inventories in order to keep their shelves full Many are now cutting prices to shift stock In America car production is at last picking up which could unwind some of the outrageous price increases for used vehicles seen last year Falling goods prices could in theory help douse the inflationary flames in the rich world easing the cost-of-living crisis giving central banks breathing room and buoying financial markets But with enough indicators of future prices pointing the other way the odds of that happening have lengthened Don’t be surprised if inflation roars for a while yet For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,The rights and wrongs of investing in natural gas,Can natural gas ever be a “green” investment? Burning any fossil fuel inevitably makes the planet warmer Yet switching power stations to gas from more carbon-intensive coal has helped countries cut their total emissions in the past Environmentalists counter that global temperatures have risen so much that all fossil-fuel use needs to be ended as quickly as possible if the world is to meet the targets laid out in the Paris agreement to limit global warming to “well below 2°c”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEuropean institutions cannot agree on the question among themselves The European Commission proposal for a “green taxonomy” a classification scheme that aims to guide sustainability-minded investors says the fuel can count as green provided it acts as a “bridge” to more renewable sources The European Investment Bank eib the eu state-backed lender by contrast has virtually ruled out investing in natural gas as inconsistent with its climate commitments The eib is not alone Multilateral development banks mdbs that channel money from rich countries towards worthy projects such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have in general turned away from financing natural gas In 2018 they signed a joint statement saying they would align their lending with the Paris goals giving them limited scope to invest in the fuel Few mdbs lent as much to gas projects as the eib did before it said in 2019 that it would start phasing out such investment Researchers at Boston University calculate that the eib provided more than half of the $637bn invested by mdbs in natural gas between 2008 and 2021 mostly for transmission and storage That is a tiny fraction of the total amount invested in energy worldwide but mdbs argue they help catalyse private investmentThe return of coal provides the case for restarting spending on gas Eager to move away from imported gas from Russia on June 19th the German government announced it was restarting some previously mothballed coal power plants Investing more in Europe gas infrastructuresuch as pipelines terminals for liquefied natural gas lng imports and storage facilitiescould alleviate a shortage of natural gas and keep the continent from having to switch on such plants At present bottlenecks prevent lng imports moving from the continent terminals which are mostly in the west to the eastern and central European countries that need to swiftly wean themselves off piped Russian gasWhat does the tension between the commission vision of “green” and the eib thinking mean for increasing investment in gas? Some think the implications are limited If there is indeed a business case for gas in Europe then the private sector could simply finance it says Sonia Dunlop of e3g a think-tank Scarce public money should be used elsewhereBut the disagreement over the question of investing in gas hints at a deeper problem Whether it is deemed green or not gas is an increasingly unattractive investment the high prices for the fuel after Russia invasion of Ukraine notwithstanding Both private and mdb investors worry that gas infrastructure could end up “stranded” as regulatory changes or technological improvements render them unprofitable mdbs that lend to poor countries are worried that such investments might leave taxpayers saddled with debts for worthless assets Even the commission taxonomy classes the fuel as “green” only until 2030 And as long as everyone agrees that gas is dirty in the long term there is little incentive to invest today For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub

consumer prices rose by 25% in the year to April compared with 83% in America Excluding fresh food and energy Japanese prices are still up by less than 1% year-on-year and wages by less than 2% There is little sign of domestically generated price growthThe weak yen meanwhile has a mixed effect It drives up imported inflation and magnifies the effect of rising dollar-denominated oil prices But after many years in which Japan price level has barely budged a shallow increase does not seem an urgent threat Even with all these external shocks inflation is barely above the central bank target of 2% Rapid moves in the currency make planning difficult for businesses but a weaker exchange rate benefits many exporters of manufactured goods as well as the holders of Japan ¥12 quadrillion in overseas assets which have gone up in yen termsNor does the mood within the boj so far hint at a coming change in policy The central bank still has several monetary doves in its roosts Kataoka Goushi was the sole board member to vote against holding policy unchanged in June but because he wanted even more stimulus not less In early June Wakatabe Masazumi the bank deputy governor said that monetary easing should be pursued to maintain wage growth And Kuroda Haruhiko the governor of the boj is a longtime advocate of monetary stimulus to revive Japan sluggish economic growthMr Kuroda is now into the final year of his term His replacement may well be Amamiya Masayoshi another deputy governor who is so entrenched in the institution that he is known as “Mr boj” Mr Amamiya has sometimes been seen as more hawkish than Mr Kuroda But in his most recent comments on monetary policy in mid-May he spoke in favour of continuing current policy without reservations Barring a change to the domestic picture or a groundswell of hawkish sentiment within the boj investors expecting a u-turn are likely to be disappointed For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,How inflation and interest rates might affect Italy budget,Before the pandemic it was a cause for excitement among economists that the real interest rate governments paid on their debts had fallen below the rate of economic growth in most rich countries allowing governments to spend more freely and worry less about running up debts But central banks’ battle with inflation today threatens to turn that relationship on its head making the fiscal position of indebted governments more perilousListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen interest rates are below growth rates governments can run primary budget deficits that is deficits before interest payments are taken into account without the debt-to-gdp ratio necessarily rising But when rates exceed economic growth primary surpluses are the only way to keep indebtedness stable The higher the starting debt the more belt-tightening neededFortunately inflation reduces the real interest rate and so most countries will gain a fiscal windfall this year Some of their debt in other words will be inflated away But if central banks successfully bring inflation down and if high interest rates endure things could get more painful The picture looks especially worrying in Italy The euro zone third-largest economy had net public debt worth nearly 140% of gdp last year Its government currently pays about 35% to borrow for ten yearsPrecisely where Italy indebtedness and borrowing costs will settle after the energy crisis is uncertain Our table shows a range of combinations for debt and financing costs and what they would imply for the country budget were growth to match the average imf forecast during 2022-27 and were inflation to fall to the European Central Bank target of 2% In reality the average tenor of outstanding Italian debt is nearly eight years so it would take time for its average financing cost to rise to the levels shown on the right-hand side of the tableAt financing costs of 3% or below Italy can run small primary deficits and still outgrow its debt The table also shows one weird effect of growth exceeding interest rates: that debt stability is easier to achieve when starting debts are higher As interest rates rise however stability requires primary surpluses of 2% or more The only time Italy has run so tight a budget since the global financial crisis was in 2012 at the height of European austerityFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Jun 23rd 2022,Is the euro zone doom loop still to be feared?,Those old enough to remember the euro zone economic crisis of a decade ago may have felt a shiver of déjà vu on June 15th when the European Central Bank ecb called an emergency meeting to discuss the widening spreads between member countries’ government-bond yields It is nearly exactly a decade ago that as yields soared Mario Draghi then the president of the ecb promised to do whatever it took to preserve the single currency Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn both instances bond spreads began to narrow after the central bank intervened Today the ecb is considering an “anti-fragmentation” tool to lower spreads say by buying the bonds of weaker countries provided they meet certain conditions Nonetheless worries that the currency union might start to look shaky remain in the air The fiscal position of Italy in particular which last year had net public debt in the region of 140% of gdp is preoccupying investors Should interest rates rise much more financial markets might start to doubt its ability to pay its debts One dangerous feature of the previous crisis was the infamous “doom loop” that connected banks and sovereigns Crudely put euro-area banks were loaded up with home sovereign debt When fears of sovereign default intensified banks’ balance-sheets crumbled which then required them to be propped up by an already wobbly state As banks cut lending the real economy weakened further worsening the public finances How much of a worry is this doom loop today? A consideration of the various links in the chain suggests it is less fearsomebut that the monster has not been slain Start with banks’ exposure to their home sovereigns After the global financial crisis in 2007-09 banks in southern European countries started to buy large amounts of bonds issued by their home government which banking regulators consider to be risk-free meaning that banks do not need to fund their holdings of them with capital Spanish lenders increased their holdings of national government bonds from around 2% of total assets in 2009 to more than 9% by 2015; Italian banks increased their holdings of home sovereign debt from 4% to nearly 11% over the same period Banks in most big euro-area countries have since reduced their exposures to their home sovereign Strikingly the boss of one of the bloc big lenders says that it no longer has any exposure to any euro-area sovereign debt But Italian banks are the big exception They remain just as exposed to their government debt as they were a decade ago In Italy at least this part of the doom loop is alive and kicking What about governments’ exposure to collapsing banks? Severing this bit of the feedback loop has certainly been an important aim of policymakers The eu banking unionwhich sought to set up a system of common supervision resolution and deposit insurancewas born nearly a decade ago The idea was to make banks more European and rescuing them less of a national affair The problem however is that the task is only half done The ecb has been in charge of supervising banks since 2014 That together with regulatory changes that have forced banks to fund lending with more capital have made it more likely that troubled lenders can be restructured meaning that sovereigns are less exposed to the risks stemming from collapsing banks than they used to be But the European resolution of banks remains incomplete and common deposit insurance has not been set up at all All told “the safety-net for banks and deposits remains predominantly national and the exposure of banks to sovereigns has not been solved” concludes Nicolas Veron of Bruegel a think-tank in Brussels If governments’ sensitivity to failing banks is somewhat lower than it used to be what about the economy exposure to zombie lenders? Europe remains largely bank-based with capital markets playing a minor role in financing firms It helps at least that banks are less stuffed with non-performing loans than they used to be and are in better shape overall But a hit to a national banking system could still impair its ability to lend to firms and households unless they find other sources of finance In 2015 the European Commission launched a plan to bolster Europe capital markets But little progress has been made Most indicators that measure the size of capital markets and the degree to which they are integrated have moved sideways The main problem say observers is that national politicians have not fully committed themselves to the difficult work of harmonising rules across countries Regulation aside there have been two big improvements within the euro zone that will help weaken the doom loop The first is on fiscal policy Without transfers between member states a national economy will always suffer when its government is forced to cut spending A sovereign under financial stress may have to cut benefits or raise taxes precisely when the economy is weak That in turn lowers tax revenues worsening the fiscal position From the start of the euro area crisis in 2010 until about 2014 countries painfully shrank their deficits hurting economic growth It was only when interest rates came down and austerity was eased that the economy began to recover The covid-19 pandemic has led to more fiscal integration The eu recovery fund financed by commonly issued debt will spend about €750bn $790bn over the next five years with more money going to support investment in the weakest economies Such a mechanism of fiscal transfers if repeated could make the sovereign-to-economy loop less severe in the future The second big improvement is political Few politicians are agitating for their countries to leave the euro which in turn means investors are not getting jittery about euro exit and debt defaultAbout a decade ago policymakers in the euro zone started off with bold plans to eliminate the doom loop Some of those have come to fruition But the overall picture is mixed With a recession looming and interest rates rising that might not be good enough For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,Can the Fed pull off a controlled slowdown of the housing market?,Estate agents are known for their sunny disposition Lindsay Garcia a realtor in Miami is no exception She talks about the city warm climate and low taxes both of which have lured a wave of footloose outsiders For much of the past two years agents enjoyed a bonanza Buyers fought to outbid each other waived property inspections and bought units sight unseen; many paid well over the asking price Then mortgage rates began to climb this year cooling the frenzy a little Only houses that were newly renovated or ready to be moved into straight away received multiple offers Ms Garcia says Now a fresh spike in mortgage rates seems to have slammed the brakes on altogetherListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn June 15th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 075 percentage points Figures released a day later revealed that the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate had hit 578% an increase of more than half a percentage point over the week before By June 17th two of Ms Garcia colleagues had been rung up by buyers abruptly calling off deals because they could no longer afford themThe plight of the would-be buyers illustrates just how swift and brutal the rise in interest rates has been and how immediate its impact is on interest-sensitive sectors such as housing In January mortgage rates were around 3% only a little above their all-time low of 267% reached during the pandemic They have nearly doubled since see chart; only in the 1980s was there a comparably rapid rise in interest rates The increase has made houses even more unaffordable In January a buyer with a deposit of $100000 looking to spend $3000 a month on housing could afford a home worth $815000 Now they can afford one worth just $600000 The prospect of a turn in the property market fortunes naturally calls to mind America housing crisis of 2007-09 But there are important differences between the two situations Rising interest rates in the late 2000s revealed just how imprudent mortgage lending had been By contrast the median fico scorea measure of creditworthinessfor mortgages today is about 48 points higher than the pre-financial-crisis level of around 700 Household balance-sheets are robust bolstered by pandemic stimulus and in aggregate there has been far less borrowing for house purchases than in the early 2000s The total value of mortgage debt is around 65% of household income compared with nearly 100% in 2007Though it is possible that pockets of dodgy debt lurk in the shadows today it seems less probable that rising rates will uncover systemic weaknesses in lending standards that could set off a vicious cycle of falling prices and foreclosures Instead the problem of 2022 is house-price growth itself “The type of acceleration in house prices that we’ve seen over the past two years is unprecedented” says Enrique Martínez-García of the Dallas Fed By the first quarter of the year the increase in American house prices over the previous two years at 37% was the fastest on record That rapid growth is a problem for the Fed argues Mr Martínez-García because it feeds into rents which in turn contribute to headline inflation According to Redfin a property platform asking rents in May were 15% higher than in the same month last year As new leases are signed these will eventually add to consumer-price inflation Indeed rising housing costs already accounted for 40% of the monthly increase in the consumer-price index in May “Cooling the housing market is almost a precondition to being able to tame inflation” says Mr Martínez-García A housing slowdown then will this time be engineered rather than uncovered The best possible outcome is that the Fed manages to slow the property market by enough to bring inflation under control without overdoing it The events of the early 1980s when interest rates last climbed so quickly illustrate what such a controlled slowdown might look like Inflation soared to well above 10% Paul Volcker had just been appointed chairman of the Fed and the federal funds rate was briefly raised to an all-time high of about 20% Property prices did fall sharplybut only in real terms From 1979 to 1982 real house prices fell by nearly a fifth even as prices in nominal terms rose by a tenth More notably housing transactions fell off a cliff Existing-home sales peaked at 4m in 1978; four years later only 2m homes were sold Higher interest rates this time are indeed likely to hit transaction volumes first That the initial consequence will be a fall in property sales rather than a rise in financial distress among homeowners can be partly explained by a quirk in the America mortgage market In most countries borrowers are offered fixed interest rates for only two to five years; when that period ends the rate floats in line with the central bank policy rate But the existence of America government-sponsored housing agencies most notably Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were set up to incentivise home ownership means that the vast majority of American mortgages are on a 30-year fixed rate That makes would-be sellers increasingly reluctant to move and give up their cheap mortgages when rates go up Buyers meanwhile can no longer afford the kind of house they want Daryl Fairweather of Redfin therefore expects the market to go into a “cold period” of scant activity for the rest of the year Things could easily get more complicated than they did in the 1980s though if the Fed is unable to act with enough precision to stabilise the market without causing prices to crash The fact that housing has been so frothy makes the task harder What has been remarkable about the past couple of years of price growth is that it has been so difficult to square with any of the “usual explanations” such as millennial household formation or supply constraints says Mr Martínez-García Once those explanations have been ruled out all that is left is “expectations” such as the fear of missing out on ever being able to buy a house Cooling a hot property market by just enough to quell inflation is one thing Deflating a bubble without popping it is another For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 21st 2022,How attractively are shares now priced?,Everyone knows or thinks they know the advice of Warren Buffett to investors: that “they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful” After share prices in America plunged firmly into bear-market territory defined as a fall of 20%-plus from a recent peak in June some will be starting to wonder whether there is enough fear in the air to warrant their being greedy Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHow attractively are shares now priced? One approach is to use the equity risk premium as a guide A rough-and-ready version of it suggests that it is not obviously a time for would-be Buffetts to swoop in Equities are not yet priced at fearful levels An opportunity for greed may yet arise But the circumstances will be such that only the steeliest of investors can take advantageStart with some definitions Stocks are riskier than bonds Owning shares should come with a higher reward for bearing the additional uncertainty about returns This reward is the equity risk premium Historically the premium has been handsome particularly in America Between 1900 and 2021 the excess real return of stocks over bonds in America was 47% a year on average according to the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook compiled by Elroy Dimson Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton three academicsThat is nice to know But what investors care about is prospective returns Yields to redemption are the obvious measure of the expected returns on bonds The higher the yield the greater the expected return By a similar logic the earnings yield ie the inverse of the share-price-to-earnings ratio is a decent guide to expected return on equities The gap between the earnings yield and long-term bond yields provides a forward-looking measure of the equity risk premium for long-horizon investors The higher this premium the keener investors should be to buy stocks over bondsThe chart shows a crude measure of the equity risk premium: the excess of the earnings yield on the s&p 500 index of shares over the yield on ten-year inflation-protected Treasuries The latter yield is a gauge of long-term real interest rates and so is a proxy for prospective risk-free returns for a long-term investor The risk premium varies over time because people risk appetite varies with the circumstances During the dotcom boom of the late 1990s for instance the equity risk premium was negative Another salient feature is the severe spikes in the premium during periods of extreme stress such as during the Great Recession in 2008-09 and the euro-zone crisis in 2011-12The current reading is broadly in line with the average over the past two decades It is also little changed from the start of the year A couple of implications follow from this First the bear market has been largely warranted by the sharp rise in expected interest rates now embedded in real bond yields Share prices have fallen but the equity risk premium has been broadly constant You might say that not much has changed with regard to the attractiveness of American shares That would not be quite right It would be truer to say that equity prices are now based on more realistic expectations of future interest ratesA second implication is that equity investors are not especially fearfulor at least their worst fears are not reflected in share prices For now recession is a forecast It is not yet a reality History suggests that in recessions American share prices fall even more sharply than they have this year Panic usually sets in And a panic is often a good buying opportunity Should such an opportunity arise again though do not imagine that it would be easy to take advantage of It takes nerve to buy when markets are plunging You can always convince yourself that an even better opportunity is around the corner Delay always seems advisable And delay often ends up meaning not making a decision at all The opportunity is missed Readers may sense a familiar conclusion coming: that market timing is a snare In this regard it is worth thinking about Mr Buffett quote in full It is only “if they [investors] insist on trying to time their participation in equities” he said that they should try to be greedy when others are fearful Mr Buffett was cautioning against a “start-and-stop” approach to the stockmarket which often leads to investors missing out on returns There are worse times to buy stocks than after a big fall But for most temperaments buying and holding for the long haul is usually the best policyRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Is trading on America stockmarket fair?

Japan has long suffered from too-low inflation although rising commodity prices have pushed the headline rate a little higher Elsewhere part of the explanation lies in the spread of two diseases An outbreak of African swine fever from 2018 to 2021 devastated the pig population in China where as many as 200m pigs were culled according to some estimates This dramatically increased the price of pork a staple food in East Asia The price has subsequently fallen back sharply In mainland China for example the price of pork fell by more than 21% in the year to May This helped offset inflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy It also helps that East Asia unlike other parts of the world eats more rice than wheat The price of rice has risen by 8% since Russia invaded Ukraine whereas wheat prices have increased by 17%The other anti-inflationary disease in the region is covid-19 Many parts of Asia turned to living with the virus more slowly and reluctantly than in the West Indonesia for example did not entirely abandon quarantine for international arrivals until March 22nd In Malaysia travel and movement did not return to normal until early May a full month after the country entered its official “transition to endemic” phase according to an index of social restrictions developed by Goldman Sachs a bank Taiwan remains cautious even now Its success in keeping covid at bay in the past has left its population with little natural immunity and less of the West fatalism about the diseaseChina of course continues to impose stringent restrictions on people movement and gathering wherever infections appear The recent lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere hampered both the economy ability to supply goods and its consumers’ willingness to buy them This twin disruption to supply and demand could in theory move prices either way But the damage to consumer spending seems to be more severe and persistent In May the second month of Shanghai lockdown retail sales fell by almost 10% in real terms compared with a year earlier even as industrial production rose by 07%Limits on cross-border travel have been devastating to the economies of Hong Kong and especially Macau which relies on visitors from the mainland to fill its casinos Indeed Macau gdp in the first three months of this year was less than half the size it reached in the same months of 2019 In that context inflation of 1% does not seem so miraculously low Indeed it is a wonder that prices are rising at all For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 19th 2022,People inflation expectations are risingand will be hard to bring down,Consumer prices across the rich world are rising by more than 9% year on year the highest rate since the 1980s Worryingly there is growing evidence that the public is starting to expect consistently high inflation Figures suggesting that Americans’ medium-term expectations of inflation had risen helped set off the market turmoil in early June which culminated in the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point Central banks urgently need to convince people that they are serious about getting inflation down But a range of evidence suggests that changing the public mind could be extraordinarily difficult Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe difference in views of expert and lay groups has become gaping Bernardo Candia Olivier Coibion and Yuriy Gorodnichenko three economists look at the inflation expectations of four groups in America Those of professional forecasters and financial markets remain close to the Fed target of 2% But consumers’ beliefs increasingly do not They expect prices to rise by more than 5% over the next year Firms exposed to surging commodity wage and other input costs expect higher inflation still Expectations are rising outside America too A dataset put together by the Cleveland Fed Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University gauges public inflation expectations in various places In May 2021 respondents in the median rich country thought inflation over the next year would be 23% Now they expect a rate of 42% Central banks face a problem in getting these expectations down again This is because few people aside from investors and financial journalists pay much notice to what they say A new paper by Alan Blinder of Princeton University and colleagues puts it more drily: “Households and firms have a low desire to be informed about monetary policy” A survey in 2014 found that only a quarter of Americans could pick out Janet Yellen as the then-chairwoman of the Fed from a list of four Two-fifths of Americans believe that the Fed inflation target exceeds 10% Small wonder that the impact of its policy announcements on inflation expectations is “muted” according to a recent study by Fiorella De Fiore of the Bank for International Settlements and colleagues Nor are Americans alone In the late 2000s researchers at the Bank of Italy assessed whether people knew what inflation was Many had only a fuzzy understandingwith half of respondents confusing price changes with price levels In recent years Japan has implemented forceful monetary easing in order to boost inflation But in 2021 more than 40% of Japanese people had “never heard” of the plan according to an official survey In the years before the pandemic public apathy to monetary policy did not much matter Inflation was low and stable Now it matters a lot Spiralling expectations could become embedded in wages and prices pushing headline inflation higher still Central bankers’ conventional toolkits may do little to bring them down Even the effect of raising interest rates is not totally clear: twice as many Americans believe that higher rates raise inflation than reduce it according to a recent The Economist/YouGov poll What more can be done? History points to several options One is to make drastic or unexpected announcements This could involve raising interest rates outside of scheduled meetingsa decision taken by India central bank in May The European Central Bank ecb has used this trick in pursuit of another goal: keeping down government-bond spreads which would otherwise threaten a debt crisis In 2012 Mario Draghi then the head of the bank made an impromptu promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro According to research by Michael Ehrmann of the ecb and Alena Wabitsch of Oxford University the words generated high traffic on Twitter among non-experts suggesting they had cut through The genius of the statement other research suggests was that it focused on the end “preserve the euro” rather than the means “buying bonds” which is easier for the public to understand The ecb has tried to repeat the trick more recently such as by calling an emergency meeting to address widening spreads Others have played the long game Paul Volcker the Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987 cultivated a reputation as what economists call an inflation “nutter”: someone willing to tolerate high unemployment to defeat the beast The public eventually got the message A recent paper by Jonathon Hazell of the London School of Economics and others argues that post-Volcker “shifts in beliefs about the long-run monetary regime” proved more important than any other factor in conquering inflation before covid-19 Andrew Bailey the head of the Bank of England has been trying to embrace his inner Volcker such as by giving Britons the impression that he cares more about inflation than he does their wages Public enemy number oneAnother solution is for politicians to get involved This has potential drawbacks because they often advocate crackpot anti-inflation schemes such as price controls Still they might be able to help After all 37% of Americans believe that the president has “a lot” of control over inflation compared with 34% for the Fed Jimmy Carter appointment of Volcker in 1979 showed that he was serious about getting inflation down In Britain Margaret Thatcher and her henchmen talked tough on price stability; their willingness to slash government budgets probably backed up those words by cooling the economy Today in America President Joe Biden says that “fighting inflation” is his “top economic priority” though he shows less inclination to tighten fiscal policy Public apathy towards central banking may be a backhanded compliment to the policymakers of the 1980s and 1990s No one needed to care about inflation when it was low Today policymakers are constrained by that very success To get inflation expectations back down then they may need to try everything in their power to get people to sit up and listen Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession Jun 16thA focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thShould China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 16th 2022,Is trading on America stockmarket fair?,In everyday parlance equity means fairness To an investor or a stockbroker though it is an ownership stake The word means both things thanks to the English Court of Chancery which operated from around the 15th to the 19th centuries and handed out rulings based on “equity” or fairness rather than common law Under common law a borrower who missed a mortgage payment would forfeit their land but in Chancery they could reclaim it by repaying the debt Over time “equity” came to mean the ownership stake in property itself Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday legal and regulatory systems are tasked with ensuring that finance is fair And Gary Gensler the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission America markets watchdog is not happy In a speech on June 8th he worried that “market segmentation and concentration” mean there is no longer a “level playing-field” in the stockmarket It is “not clear” he said that the “market system is as fair and competitive as possible for investors”A fair market is transparent accessible and uses a reasonable method to arrange buyers and sellersthink of a public farmers’ market with clearly stated prices and an orderly queue A decade ago this was a decent if simplified description of most equity trades Three-quarters of them by volume were conducted on public exchanges; only a quarter were done “off-exchange” No more In 2021 during the “meme-stock” craze when retail bets sent GameStop shares soaring the share of off-exchange trades swelled to a peak of 47% Retail punters are far less likely to have their orders executed on public exchanges than institutional investors More than 90% of retail orders are sent to a concentrated group of marketmakers that pay brokers to deliver the orders to them a practice called payment for order flow At first glance this system is not obviously bad for retail investors BrokersCharles Schwab say or Robinhoodare obliged to seek “best execution” for their customers In order to direct a retail order to a marketmaker like Citadel Securities or Virtu they must beat the prevailing price offered by public exchangesthe so-called “national best bid and offer” nbboa feature known as “price improvement” That means retail traders probably get better prices than most institutions Marketmakers are happy to pay for their business because the flows are not risky It is easy to match retail flows against each other By matching trades they can give a lower price than the best offer to the buyer a higher price than the best bid to the seller and have some left overa slice of which they pay to the broker and the rest of which they keep The payments mean brokers do not need to charge customers commissionYet there are flaws Post-trade price improvement makes it impossible for punters to know ahead of trading which broker would ultimately give them the best execution price As Mr Gensler put it “price improvement without competition…is not necessarily the best price improvement” Marketmakers and brokers might start to hang on to more of the benefits instead of passing them on to punters Larry Tabb of Bloomberg a data firm has found that American retail investors in March 2022 collected 47% of the benefit $37bn on an annualised basis while brokers were paid 13%$900m The marketmakers themselves took some 40% $31bnMoreover the system of price improvement relative to the nbbo only benefits customers if the nbbo is a good benchmarka claim that is getting shakier For a start the nbbo is measured for orders of 100 shares or more This was sensible in 2014 when just 15% of trades were in smaller quantities By March 2022 though the share had climbed to 55% And if trading volumes continue to move off-exchange the benchmarks will become ever less meaningful One solution from Mr Gensler is for exchanges to hold auctions for retail stock orders a practice typically used to fill retail orders for equity derivatives By redirecting retail flows to exchanges this would radically reshape American stockmarketsto the benefit of exchanges and the detriment of marketmakersand is therefore likely to be fiercely resisted Hours after Mr Gensler spoke Dan Gallagher a former sec commissioner now at Robinhood said the current structure represented “a really good climate for retail” A shakeup could face legal challenges too But Mr Gensler is right to be trying Taking a punt on today violent stockmarkets is daunting enough Investors should get a fair shot at itRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Tech investors are prizing cash generation again Jun 9thThe return of the inventory cycle Jun 2ndIs China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 15th 2022,Eight days that shook the markets,“I do not expect moves of this size to be common” said Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve on June 15th The central bank had just raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points 075 percentage points to 15%-175% It was the third increase in as many meetings and the biggest jump in short-term rates since 1994 The move was both expected and surprising Mr Powell had warmed up markets weeks ago to the prospect of a 50-basis-point increase at this monetary-policy meeting But in the days leading up to it investors had quickly and fully priced in a larger risewith more to comeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Powell comment about uncommonly large increases was enough to spark a partial reversal of the sharp rise in bond yields over the preceding days and a relief rally in share prices But however much he tried to sugar-coat the message rates are going up by a lot more and the chances of a hard landing for the economy have surely increased as a consequence Recession is now more widely expected if not yet by the Fed And the rapid changes in the market mood show just how much the Fed and other rich-world central banks have lost control of eventsThe Fed interest-rate decision came at the end of an extraordinary few days in financial markets in which bond yields shot up at a violent rate share prices plunged and riskier assets notably bitcoin but also Italian government bonds were trashed The story begins not in Washington or New York but in Sydney where on June 7th the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points citing growing worries about inflation It continued in Amsterdam where in the following days the European Central Bank ecb held its monetary-policy meeting in a break from its usual setting in Frankfurt Christine Lagarde the central bank boss confirmed that a 25-basis-point rate increase would be on the cards in July But she went much further The ecb she said expects to raise interest rates perhaps by 50 basis points in September and anticipates “sustained” increases thereafter The catalyst for this more hawkish stance was a sharp upward revision in the central bank forecasts for inflationThis set the stage for a dramatic shift in bond markets which events elsewhere added impetus to The yield on ten-year German government bonds known as bunds rose quickly to above 175% over the following days The yield on riskier sorts of euro-zone government bonds notably Italian btps rose by even more The spread excess yield on btps over bunds widened sharply taking Italy ten-year yield above 4% Indeed spreads had risen so swiftly that the ecb rate-setting council held an emergency meeting on June 15th to address the matter see next story But it was news from America that really moved markets Figures released on Friday June 10th showed that annual consumer-price inflation rose to 86% in May the highest rate since 1981 Underlying price “core” pressures were unexpectedly strong To make matters worse a survey by the University of Michigan showed that consumers’ expectations of medium-term inflation had risen markedly Taken together the reports suggested that inflation would be much harder to bring down Treasury yields rose sharply as the bond market began to price in more and faster interest-rate increases by the Fed The biggest moves were at the short end of the yield curve which is most sensitive to shifts in monetary policy Yields on two-year Treasuries rose by 57 basis points in the space of just two trading days But longer-term rates shifted too see chart 1 Stocks could hardly escape the reckoning see chart 2 The s&p 500 index of leading shares fell by 3% on June 10th and by 4% the following Monday The cumulative losses took the stockmarket firmly into bear-market territory defined as a fall of more than 20% from its recent peak The tech-heavy nasdaq index has fallen by even more Higher Treasury yields have weighed on share prices but have been a fillip to the dollar The dxy an index of the greenback against half a dozen rich-world currencies is up by 10% this year The strength is particularly marked against the yen which has fallen to a new 24-year low While the Fed is tightening policy to bring down inflation Japan central bank is furiously buying bonds in order to raise it The recent volatility particularly in the bond market has been quite extreme What might explain this? As bad as the inflation backdrop had seemed before last week investors had consoled themselves with the idea that the worst of it was now in the past The Bank of America global fund-manager survey suggests that in recent weeks investors had increased their allocation to bondsperhaps judging that bond prices had stopped falling Bond prices move inversely to yields If so the poor inflation figures caught them out A market that leans heavily in one direction often snaps back when the wind changes And poor liquidity amplifies the effect Changes in regulation have made it costlier for banks to hold large inventories of bonds to facilitate client trading The Fed once a reliable buyer of Treasuries is winding down its purchases When investors want to sell there are too few willing to take the other side of the trade The violent market moves in the days leading up to the Fed meeting may have exaggerated the sense of panic Yet it is hard to argue that investors are bullish The Bank of America survey shows that optimism among fund managers about the economic outlook is at an all-time low Can a hard landing be avoided?

 Jun 15th 2022,The European Central Bank responds to market turmoil,Surging inflation and a weakening economy are not the only worries preoccupying the European Central Bank ecb As inflation rose higher still the bank promised on June 9th to raise interest rates over the coming months and to end its asset purchases Then in subsequent days financial markets decided to remind the central bank that the new policy could mean Italy public debt at 150% of the country gdp might look wobbly as interest rates start to rise Italian government-borrowing costs started to climb Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs the yield on Italy ten-year sovereign bonds surpassed 4% the central bank called an emergency meeting on June 15th Its governing council tasked the staff with coming up with an “anti-fragmentation” tool a government-bond-buying scheme that would help prop up sovereigns in distress The announcement marks a fundamental change in how the ecb sees its role in bond marketsBeing a central banker in a monetary union is hard The euro members differ according to their growth prospects and debt levels leading to gaps “spreads” between their bond yields and the German bund yield which is regarded as the risk-free rate Investors routinely debate the threat of a country defaulting or exiting the euro By contrast there is little doubt that the Bank of England stands behind gilts; no one worries that Britain might leave sterling Differences in liquidity and the extent to which a government bonds are seen as benchmark assets matter too In a recently published paper Hanno Lustig of Stanford University and colleagues estimate that this “convenience yield” the yield that investors are willing to forgo for safety and liquidity explained more than half the variation in spreads between euro countries from 2008 to 2020 In times of stressas when the pandemic struck in March 2020investors seeking safety drive up the spread between say Italian and German bonds see chart These spreads between government bonds then translate into differing borrowing costs for firms and households Despite sharing a currency and the Alps borrowers in Tyrol Austria and South Tyrol in Italy could face quite different interest rates because their respective national governments are charged different rates by investors And too big a divergence can be a problem for the ecb because it sets short-term interest rates for the euro area as a whole The wider the spreads the less likely it is that its desired interest rate is reflected in conditions on the ground But the precise point at which spreads become wider than economic differences warrant is controversial In a speech on June 14th Isabel Schnabel a member of the ecb executive board explained the bank thinking She argued that safe interest rates were rising around the world at a time when threats to growth were becoming more prominent Widening spreads meant that financial conditions had tightened more in some parts of the euro zone than in others The ecb would seek to avoid any “disorderly repricing of risk” that could impair the functioning of monetary policy and so pose a threat to ensuring stable inflation The question is what counts as “disorderly” Shortly before the emergency meeting Italian ten-year spreads on bunds rose to 24 percentage points Not everyone agrees that was a problem Volker Wieland a former member of the German council of economic experts argues that Italy debt is not unsustainable and that spreads did not warrant action by the ecb In addition he points out the ecb already has the means to contain panicky rises in spreads Yet the existing tool outright monetary transactions omtannounced in 2012 when Mario Draghi the ecb former president said he would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the eurohas become politically toxic It comes with tough conditionsnamely that the countries in need of ecb support subject themselves to an imf-style reform programme Luis Garicano a Spanish member of the European Parliament argues that the ecb will seek to recreate omt without the toxicity The central bank itself has been at pains to emphasise that any new tool to contain spreads would “remain within its mandate”: in other words that any bond purchases would be either limited or tied to conditions Unless the euro zone comes closer to being a federal entity with a common finance ministry and shared taxes and benefits spreads will be a fact of life Further banking or fiscal integration could help narrow them without central-bank action But progress on those cannot be counted upon With its announcement the ecb has made clear that it sees managing spreads as part of its job For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 15th 2022,The construction industry remains horribly climate-unfriendly,Covid-induced lockdowns may have upended the world of work but they have not killed the skyscraper Even as workers stay home to avoid the commute cities’ penchant for these concrete marvels of engineering continues unabated In midtown Manhattan JPMorgan Chase has knocked down its old headquarters in favour of a new glass tower that will rise 18 storeys higher Across the city more than a dozen supertall structureswhich rise higher than 300mare in the works In London where gleaming new landmarks are given irreverent nicknames such as “Walkie Talkie” or “The Gherkin” more than 200 towers have transformed the skyline since 2009 The construction frenzy is not limited to big cities By one estimate the planet will add floor space the size of New York City every month until 2060 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSome worry that this pace of construction could literally cost the Earth Today buildings are responsible for almost 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions with homes alone accounting for nearly 20% Property emissions are a combination of two things The first is the day-to-day running of a building: energy used to light up heat or cool homes office blocks and shopping malls The carbon produced in this way is “operational” in the vernacular and accounts for 27% of all annual carbon emissions globally The other type is “embodied” carbon which refers to emissions tied to the building process maintenance and any demolition Overall embodied carbon is responsible for around 10% of annual emissions though it will vary depending on the type of buildingWorryingly the carbon footprint of buildings is growing On the current path carbon emissions related to buildings are expected to double by 2050 It is true that in 2020 emissions from managing property fell after hitting a record high in 2019 according to the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction Globalabc an industry body But that was mostly owing to lockdowns which lowered emissions from all sorts of other activities too Efforts to build greener played a minimal role Worse still advances in building energy efficiency are stalling The global rate of annual improvement fell by half between 2016 and 2019 according to Globalabc tracker which measures indicators such as incremental investment in the energy performance of buildings along with the share of renewable-energy use Policymakers are scrambling to find solutions New energy-efficiency standards for buildings in England and Wales mean that one in ten offices in central London risks becoming obsolete in 2023 Nearly 60% could become unusable by 2027 Across the eu where nearly two-thirds of the building stock relies on fossil fuels for heating and cooling officials want nearly half of a building energy to come from renewable sources by 2030 Cities are setting lofty targets too New York is aiming for carbon-free electricity by 2040; Los Angeles for zero-emissions buildings by 2050 Hot propertyHomeowners are also being urged to go green In Britain energy-performance requirements for new homes will be dramatically tightened from 2025 In Italy the government has pledged to cover the full cost of green renovations plus an extra 10% to incentivise those still unsure about switching through tax deductions of up to €100000 $104000 per home More than €21bn has been paid out since the scheme was launched in July 2020Even so progress is slow To meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement global emissions must hit net zero between 2050 and 2070 Today less than 1% of buildings are net-zero Nudging homeowners is proving challenging Total greenhouse-gas emissions for American houses have fallen by 2% since 2005 versus the 7% that would be consistent with the Paris agreement according to Citigroup a bank This is mirrored in many big economies In Britain the CO2-equivalent emissions of homes fell by around 1m tonnes between 2018 and 2019less than half the cuts made by the transport sector Three obstacles make it harder to build sustainably First the property industry has focused almost entirely on making buildings more efficient to run at the expense of embodied carbon emissions As a result little progress has been made on monitoring and restricting embodied carbon Britain for example has passed legislation requiring new homes to produce at least 75% less carbon from 2025 Yet it places no limits on the upfront carbon emissions needed to build or dispose of themThere are exceptions The Netherlands has required whole-life carbon assessments for some large buildings since 2013 California imposes carbon-intensity limits on certain construction materials For now embodied carbon accounts for a smaller share of global emissions than the operational sort But that will change as buildings become more energy-efficient In many modern buildings embodied carbon already represents as much as half of total lifetime emissions The second hurdle is the indestructible appeal of the wrecking ball The building sector would sooner knock down a structure than reuse it resulting in a carbon-intensive cycle of demolition and construction This is partly because the costs of revamping properties often exceeds their value Tax structures across the rich world incentivise demolition over reuse For example until March 2022 most new buildings in Britain were exempt from value-added tax while most renovation and repairs were liable for vat at 20% vat has since been scrapped on some energy-efficiency measures but will rise from 2027This economic model is costly for the planet Construction gobbles up nearly all of the world cement half of all steel production and around a quarter of aluminium output and plastics all of which spew vast amounts of emissions a year In the process construction generates around a third of the eu waste measured by weight In Britain construction demolition and excavation amounts to nearly two-thirds of all waste produced Pockets of the sector are innovating Startups venture capitalists and some cement-makers are all looking either to replace concrete or to make it greener New methods such as modular construction which reduces waste by assembling components in a factory before moving them on-site are also gaining traction Nearly half of new homes in Finland Norway and Sweden are factory-built Yet the overall pace of innovation is desultory because of a third obstacle: the chronically underwhelming productivity of the construction sector as a whole Global productivity growth in the industry has long lagged behind that of the wider economy Building methods for new homes have barely evolved in over a century At the same time the pandemic has exacerbated long-standing labour shortages in construction The sector was already struggling to produce enough tradespeople skilled in building sustainably Meanwhile calls to go green will only grow more urgent Population growth and voracious demand for housing mean the size of the built environment is expanding at a faster rate than efforts to slash energy use An explosion of new buildings in China South-East Asia and Africa will continue to fuel construction In these places more than half of all buildings that will exist 30 years from now have not yet been built If the world is to reach net-zero emissions the construction sector will need to make enormous stridesand fast For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter And for more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Jun 14th 2022,The Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession,American economists are no longer hawks or doves but optimists or pessimists With annual inflation running at 86% in May everyone agrees the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates sharply and on June 15th it did so by 075 percentage points The disagreement now is not over whether the Fed must fight inflation but how painful the consequences will be Pessimists point to the long history of bouts of monetary-policy tightening being followed by recessions Optimists say the Fed can bring inflation down to its 2% target merely by slowing economic growthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Fed is in the optimists’ camp In a recent speech Christopher Waller one of the central bank rate-setters spelt out the argument It hinges on America hot labour market There were almost twice as many job openings as there were unemployed workers in April with the ratio near a record high reached in March And wages are more than 5% higher than a year ago Such is the heat that McDonalds is cutting workers from the kitchen by shrinking its menus Although wage growth is slowing a little the obvious imbalance between the demand for workers and their supply means the Fed cannot count on further cooling Without it prices are likely to continue rising fast too as workers spend their incomes and firms pass on their costsA pessimist would see plentiful job openings as a sign of how out of whack the labour market has become on the Fed watch The central bank sees them as evidence that it can cool things down without turfing anyone out of a job Fewer vacancies and therefore less competition for workers might lower wage growth and inflation without raising unemployment This idea motivates the belief of Jerome Powell the Fed chairman that the economy could face only “some pain” from disinflationakin to suffering from the side-effects of an inoculation rather than the diseaseThe argument can be cast as one about the slope of the “Beveridge curve” which traces the relationship between the vacancy and unemployment rates It is named after William Beveridge a British economist who in 1944 established the importance of vacancies in determining unemployment The curve is a mysterious beast It often shifts outwards during recessions as it did after the global financial crisis when more vacancies were needed to support any given level of unemployment Economists speculated that it had become harder to match workers to jobs perhaps because they were in the wrong place or had the wrong skillsSince covid-19 struck the Beveridge curve has moved outwards more dramatically still perhaps reflecting the rise of home working the decline of city centres and changing patterns of consumer spending see chart Its recent shape suggests that were vacancies to return to their 2019 level when the labour market was arguably last in balance the unemployment rate would rise from 36% today to more than 6% That is hard to imagine without an accompanying economic contraction A rise of just 05 percentage points in the three-month average unemployment rate from its low over the preceding 12 months is an indicator of recession Every time it has occurred since 1950 it has either coincided with or shortly been followed by a downturna principle known as the “Sahm rule” named for Claudia Sahm an American economist Mr Waller however thinks that the shape of the Beveridge curve will change again as vacancies fall The curve outward shift during the pandemic reflects firing as well as hiring: lots of workers lost their jobs early on Layoffs increase the unemployment rate for a given level of vacancies and push out the Beveridge curve Today though few workers are being sacked Perhaps the Fed can manage to cool the economy and as a result lower the vacancy rate but without increasing layoffs In this scenario the curve would be steeper on the way down than it was on the way up Reducing the vacancy rate to its 2019 level while holding layoffs constant would imply only a modest rise in unemployment to around 45% Though that would still trigger the Sahm rule “the past is not always prescriptive of the future” said Mr Waller noting that vacancies have never before been so highThe perils of positive thinkingThe Fed maths are sound Yet its argument looks like the latest instance of over-optimism among monetary policymakers who have downplayed the extent of the inflation scare and underestimated the action needed to fight it Why would tighter policy shrink vacancies but not increase layoffs? Higher interest rates reduce consumption and investment which might cause the weakest firms to shrink or even shut down Mr Waller said that “outside of recessions layoffs don’t change much” Yet recession is precisely the outcome that pessimists fear will follow from higher rates The historical record backs up that worryand provides little support for the Fed argument Research by Alex Domash and Larry Summers both of Harvard University and firmly in the pessimists’ camp finds that there has never been an instance in which the vacancy rate has fallen substantially without unemployment rising significantly within two years A reduction in vacancies of 20% is associated with on average a three-percentage-point rise in the unemployment ratecomparable with what is implied by the recent Beveridge curve Mr Waller argument implies a drop in vacancies of fully 35%A final problem with the Fed plan is that it does not preclude persistent inflation Even if the labour market returns to balance inflation could stay high if workers and firms come to expect rapid price increases In economics textbooks it is high inflation expectations not the difficulty of bringing demand back into line with supply that makes it hard to slow price rises without causing a recession That is why it is such bad news that people long-term inflation expectations have recently risen noticeably according to a survey of consumers by the University of Michigan Getting expectations down typically means running the economy cold Each time the Fed is proved to have been overly optimistic its credibility ebbs making a dire outcome more likely Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thShould China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 13th 2022,America inflation headache gets worse,Editor note June 14th 2022: this story was updated to reflect new expectations of higher rate rises by the FedIn an alternate universe America clearly passed its peak in inflation a couple of months ago; the Federal Reserve is still talking tough but investors have started to expect less monetary tightening a great relief for stockmarkets; and Joe Biden can at last sense victory over rising prices arguably the greatest nemesis of his presidency thus far Until a few days ago many thought America would be inhabiting that other world Alas a brutal batch of data has awoken them to a more dispiriting reality Inflation far from peaking seems to be gaining altitude with potentially dramatic consequences for the Fed for investors and for American politicsOn June 10th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that the consumer-price index in May was 86% higher than a year earlier the fastest annual rate of inflation since 1981 More concerning was the momentum Month on month consumer prices rose by 1% well above the 03% increase in AprilAdding to the grim news was a plunge in consumer sentiment to a record low as measured by a closely watched survey from the University of Michigan The principal cause was stubbornly high inflation Consumers now expect an average inflation rate of 33% over the next five to ten years up from their expectation of just 3% a month earlier This does not yet mean that inflation expectations are “unanchored”a much-dreaded condition that could set the stage for an upward spiral in pricesbut it certainly is enough to stir fear at the Fed The broadening of inflationary pressures from goods such as cars and electronics to wages and rental costs darkens the backdrop And motorists will have noticed the surging price of petrol which for the first time ever now exceeds $5 a gallon Had America been in the more benign alternate universe talk now would have centred on when the Fed might be able to adopt a more relaxed posture Indeed as recently as May 23rd Raphael Bostic president of the Fed branch in Atlanta said the central bank may want to pause its interest-rate increases at its meeting in September in order to take stock of all the latest developments Such restraint now seems off the table Instead market pricing has shifted in a far more hawkish direction Most investors now think the Fed will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on June 15th at the conclusion of a regular rate-setting meeting The last time that the Fed delivered such a jumbo rate rise was in 1994 under Alan Greenspan Moreover many expect that the Fed will follow up with yet another three-quarter-point increase at its next meeting in July and then a half-point in September That would make for the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980sThe prospect of the central bank slamming on the monetary brakes has unnerved markets The S&P 500 Wall Street flagship stock index has tumbled by 5% since the inflation data were released Tech stocks from Amazon to Tesla have sold off even more sharply And for some high-risk assets the carnage has been far worse The price of Bitcoin fell by more than 10% on June 13th after Celsius a cryptocurrency lending firm paused all withdrawals from its platform because of “extreme market conditions” The historical record suggests that America would be lucky to escape a recession when the Fed tightens so aggressivelyFor Mr Biden administration the economic frustrations are only deepening On one hand inflation is much more than just an American problem In Britain consumer prices have been rising even faster hitting an annual pace of 9% in April From Germany to Australia inflationary pressures are bubbling up Even Japan long mired in deflation is not immune The rapid ascent in food and energy prices caused in large part by Russia invasion of Ukraine is a global affliction Continuing snags in cross-border supply chains stemming from the covid-19 pandemic have made matters worse Mark Zandi an economist with Moody Analytics an arm of a credit-rating agency estimates that Russia war and the lingering covid pandemic account for nearly two-thirds of the annual rise in inflation over the past yearOn the other hand American voters will not be so forensic in their analysis of price trends nor so forgiving in their assessment of Mr Biden responsibility Just over 500 days into his presidency 49% of Americans disapprove of his performance while 41% approve according to weekly opinion polls conducted by The Economist and YouGov That negative gap of eight percentage points puts Mr Biden in a weak position at this point in the electoral cycle albeit in a slightly better one than Donald Trump at the same time in his presidency Mid-term elections due to be held in November rarely go well for the president party Sky-high inflation could make them an unmitigated disaster for Democrats with Republicans on track to wrest control from them of both the Senate and the House of Representatives Mr Biden has tried to direct attention to the millions of jobs recovered over the past year as America claws its way back from the pandemic But the soaring cost of living and the rising prospect of recession are instead top of mind 
 Jun 9th 2022,Refiners are providing a fresh source of drama for oil markets,America driving season has officially begun Despite rising inflation and the lingering threat of the pandemic motorists hit the highways with gusto over the recent Memorial Day long weekend Some 40m Americans travelled by road an increase of 83% on the same weekend a year earlier That wanderlust came even as prices at the pump were about 50% above last year levels driven by an intense squeeze on global refiningListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn normal times the refining business is a low-margin low-drama adjunct to the geopolitically charged upstream business of oil production and the politically charged downstream business of retail sales Refiners typically make profit margins of $5-10 a barrel and often go through painful spells of unprofitability This time however refining is playing a starring rolethe machinations of the oil-producing countries war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian oil exports notwithstanding Margins for many refiners have rocketed and bottlenecks in the sector are propelling global petrol prices upwards Three factors explain why refining is in the limelight The first is a long-term decline in investment in advanced economies With oil demand in the rich world forecast to plunge over the next two decades investors are unwilling to spend many billions of dollars on facilities that could become stranded assets Adding to this is environmental pressure on refining which is seen as especially dirty and regulations in California and Europe that favour greener fuels Outside China and the Middle East where capacity is expanding refining capacity has plunged by some 3m barrels per day bpd since the start of the pandemic reckons Alan Gelder of Wood Mackenzie an energy consultancy The second factor that has roiled the refining business is Chinese policymaking China has historically been a net exporter of refined products sending large volumes to other Asian countries In an attempt to fight local pollution and help meet climate targets however officials have cut export quotas for big refiners of gasoline jet fuel and other products by more than 50% this year On official plans China is set to stop exporting most carbon-intensive refined products altogether by 2025 The perverse result is that it is sitting on roughly 7% of global spare capacity even as the rest of the world thirsts for transport fuels The third big disruptive force is of course Russia war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions imposed on its exports of hydrocarbons America and Britain have banned purchases of Russian oil; the eu has announced a partial embargo on crude imports including one on refined products later this year The effect of all this is not clear-cut By widespread accounts including from tanker-tracking experts Russia is now exporting more crude oil than it did before the war It is selling lots of cut-rate crude to India in particular which is importing over 700000 barrels a day more than it did before the invasion When it comes to refined products though both official sanctions and the voluntary “self sanctions” embraced by Western firms seem to be biting According to Natasha Kaneva of JPMorgan Chase a bank Russia is selling roughly 500000 fewer barrels of refined product a day than it was before the war and may have been forced to shut down as much as 14m bpd of refining capacity in May The result is an unprecedented shift argues Richard Joswick of s&p Global a research firm: “The world has plenty of refining capacity but the spare capacity is moving into Russia and China” As a result he reckons that utilisation rates for refiners in the rest of the world will be much higher than previously envisioned The refining crunch could continue for a while yet The coming Atlantic hurricane season which is forecast to be stronger than normal may shut down refineries in the Gulf of Mexico Another factor is the precise timing and intensity of Europe latest round of sanctions on Russian oil exports If implemented aggressively these could further squeeze the sector Market forces could yet save the day The painful price spikes seen at petrol pumps will eventually cool demand a little and could lead to improvements in energy efficiency both of which will help balance markets A shift in trade flows could also come to Europe aid India world-class refiners for instance are turning global crisis into local opportunity rbc Capital Markets an investment firm reckons that the country “is becoming the de facto refining hub for Europe” Big new refineries are scheduled to come online soon in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia which should help ease the shortages too As Mr Joswick observes “With margins this large everybody has an incentive to run refineries flat out” Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Jun 9th 2022,Mighty Asian financial institutions are reshaping global capital flows,When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates the effects are felt far and wide Capital shifts in and out of the huge stock of global dollar-denominated assets The Fed is expected to act forcefully over the next year raising rates to around 3% the highest level since early 2008 But this time the response of the biggest foreign holders of dollar assets particularly those in Asia could hold surprises A burgeoning group of large private institutions is changing and potentially complicating the pictureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTen years ago “official” foreign investorsmainly central banks managing their currency reservesheld $34trn in American Treasuries about three-quarters of all Treasuries held abroad Anyone wanting to understand the huge flows in and out of dollar bonds therefore kept an eagle eye on the big reserve managers There has been plenty of movement of late China reservesthe largest single foreign stash of Treasuriesfell by $68bn in April 2% of the total and the largest monthly drop in more than five years Japan reserves declined by $31bn the biggest-ever monthly fall India reserves shrank by $26bn in March the most since the market panic of October 2008 Those in South Korea and Taiwan have fallen too Reserve managers are a tight-lipped bunch and rarely explain precisely why their holdings have changed But some of the recent declines are likely to reflect simple valuation effects The dollar has strengthened; as a result holdings denominated in other currencies such as the euro are worth fewer dollars Some reserve managers have also intervened in the market by selling their holdings in order to limit currency depreciation Yet this presents an increasingly partial picture of capital flows Asian private institutions that cater to ageing populations such as pension funds and insurers have exploded in recent years The assets of Taiwan life insurers alone for instance have more than doubled in less than a decade Rather like central banks these tend to buy and hold safe government bonds and liquid corporate debtAs a consequence the share of Treasuries owned by official investors has fallen to 58% of all Treasuries held abroad Private foreign holdings make up the rest and have risen from $11trn to $28trn over the past decade Sales and purchases of Treasuries by private investors can swamp those made by official investors as recent trends have made clear Official investors sold $36bn in Treasuries to American punters in the first three months of this year That looks measly compared with the purchases made by foreign private investors They snapped up $235bn in Treasuries the biggest haul in any quarter on record This divergence makes sense Reserve managers get out of Treasuries when American interest rates climb to protect their currencies from a stronger dollar Private investors enticed by juicier yields on long-dated bonds dive in Even quasi-public institutions like Japan and South Korea mammoth state-pension schemes have goals and risk tolerances that differ from reserve managers Nonetheless because most of the newly important institutions grew rapidly during a period of low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates predicting their actions as circumstances change will not be easy Things are murkiest of all in China where the aims of financial institutions and the government foreign-exchange managers can dovetail In 2020 and 2021 for instance China official reserves were curiously stable raising analysts’ eyebrows While most other Asian countries with large trade surpluses were reporting surging reserves China rose by less than 5% That raised the possibility that China was using its banks to intervene in the market: Alex Etra of Exante Data a research firm and Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank have pointed to the surging value of Chinese lenders’ net foreign assets as evidence of hidden intervention So far this year though there is little indication that China has used its state banks to disguise intervention Interpreting the shifts in capital flows was hardly easy when it involved deciphering the actions of relatively taciturn reserve managers The new more crowded field of investors with various holdings strategies and objectives will give analysts an even bigger headache For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 9th 2022,A focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery,It is fashionable in some circles to lament the “cult of gross domestic product” The pursuit of growth this criticism goes blinds officials to less quantifiable but worthier objectives be it a contented population or a clean environment For many economists the concern about gdp is very different They see huge value in the core mission of the measure: namely to provide as timely and accurate a snapshot of the state of the economy as possible a lodestar for governments setting policies and for companies making decisions Their criticism instead is that gdp occasionally struggles to achieve this and that better alternatives might exist Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis debate has again come to the fore in America because of an unprecedented gap between gdp and its close relative gross domestic income gdi In theory the two ought to be aligned gdp tracks all expenditure in the economy summing up the market value of consumption investment government spending and net exports in a specific period gdi tracks the earnings associated with that expenditure summing up wages profits and any other income In reality the two never match up perfectly since the long-suffering bean-counters in statistical agencies must draw on different sources released at different times to tot them upThe gap between gdi and gdp officially known as “the statistical discrepancy” is typically about 1% Since late 2020 however the discrepancy has been much larger In the first quarter of this year America gdi was fully 35% larger than its gdp That is much more than a rounding error As Ben Harris and Neil Mehrotra of the Treasury Department wrote on May 26th when the latest gdi data were released it results in remarkably different pictures of the economy If gdp is the better reflection of reality economic output is still about 2% below its pre-pandemic trend If gdi is accurate the economy is 12% above trend a far stronger recoveryOne approach to reconciling gdp and gdi is just to split the difference In 2015 the Council of Economic Advisers in Barack Obama White House laid out the case for doing so calling the average the “gross domestic output” gdo The crucial point is that both gdp and gdi derive from entirely independent gauges of output Combining them should on average reduce measurement errors Mr Obama advisers found that gdo was an excellent predictor of later revisions to gdp For instance when gdo growth is half a percentage point faster than gdp growth it is associated with a subsequent upward revision to gdp growth by roughly half a percentage point This observation is slowly creeping into mainstream thinking The Bureau of Economic Analysis has started publishing the simple average of gdp and gdi though few journalists or analysts bother to mention it in their reportsAccounting for the huge discrepancy at present is somewhat trickier A useful starting point is the observation that the gdi-gdp gap opened up at the height of the covid-19 pandemic as the government stimulus flowed into the economy The sudden infusion of cash through transfers to households and loans to businesses appears to have messed up conventional measures of economic activity Corporate profits have been uncharacteristically strong explaining the vigour in gdi In principle that should have been mirrored in much more robust gdp readings tooMatthew Klein the author of “The Overshoot” an economics newsletter and who worked at The Economist a decade ago reckons that an undercounting of business investment in gdp may be the most likely cause Statisticians have struggled to keep tabs on all the newfangled ways that companies spend money from software to cloud computing During the pandemic entire business models were upended to accommodate online shopping and remote working; it stands to reason that investment data may have failed to capture such spendingAnother possibility running in the opposite direction is that incomes have been overstated Some people and even businesses may have mistakenly inflated their incomes at least in a statistical sense Dean Baker of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research a left-leaning think-tank noted back in 2011 that there was a correlation between asset bubbles and gdi When the stockmarket soars as it did during much of 2020 and 2021 gdi tends to outstrip gdp Capital gains are not supposed to count as income in gdp calculations as they reflect the prices of existing assets rather than production of new ones But the pattern suggests that people sometimes may misreport capital gains as ordinary incomeNerds to the rescueThe uncertainty about whether to blame the discrepancy on undercounted business investment or overstated income does seem to argue in favour of the simple gdi-gdp average as a measure of economic output That however is not entirely satisfactory In a paper in 2010 Jeremy Nalewaik then an economist with the Federal Reserve showed that gdi was generally closer to the mark than gdp in registering fluctuations in the business cycle It did a better job of documenting the true extent of the downturn in 2007-09 Moreover its outperformance relative to gdp over the past two years is also more consistent with the run-up in inflation Policymakers who had paid more attention to gdi may have become more concerned sooner about economic overheatingFrustratingly initial gdi estimates come out a month after the first gdp figures But researchers are on the case In a paper published in January by the Cleveland Fed economists pulled together gdp gdi and a basket of monthly indicators such as the unemployment rate and average hours worked in manufacturing The result they hope is something closer to “true gdp” that can be updated on a monthly basis Encouragingly it performed well in documenting the recovery from the pandemic If it proves itself over time it will be one more in a dizzying array of indicators to keep track of But the message is clear: a focus on conventional gdp alone is unduly restrictive at best and misleading at worst Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Should China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 9th 2022,Tech investors are prizing cash generation again,Iconic hip-hop artists are rarely mentioned alongside Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham as sources of investing wisdom But Wu-Tang Clan 1994 hit “CREAM” immortalised a saying all investors should be familiar with: Cash Rules Everything Around Me Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor much of the post-pandemic boom in equity markets cash and the gauges of corporate valuation that are associated with it were deeply out of fashion Money was cheap nearly free particularly for technology companies Investors tripped over each other to finance fast-growing startups with only the fuzziest plans for achieving profitability Some large listed companies reached absurd valuations relative to their ability to generate cash That has changed dramatically over the past six months As interest rates have risen reducing the present value of future profits a company ability to generate cashflows today has become relevant again This is perhaps causing the most upheaval in tech where many stocks are priced for profit growth well into the future That technology stocks have led the recent sell-off is well-known But the shift goes deeper as an analysis of their average free-cashflow yield in 2019-21 reveals This measure takes the money a company generates after operating expenses and capital investment are accounted for and divides it by its market capitalisation providing a gauge of the size of its cash streams relative to market value Take global listed tech firms that were worth more than $1bn at the start of 2020 and divide them into two groups: the hares whose valuations raced ahead of their cash-generating ability resulting in below-average free-cashflow yields; and the more plodding tortoises with above-average yields Between the end of 2019 and the peak of America nasdaq index in November last year the share price of the median hare rose by around 24%; the tortoise by 15% Since then however the hares have tumbled by around 22% compared with only 8% for the tortoises Over the two periods as a whole the cheaper tortoises have outperformed their dearer peers by around six percentage points The division between the hares and the tortoises is not perfectthough Tesla for instance has fallen recently it has still done spectacularly over the period as a whole despite relatively low free-cashflow yields Yet the trend is clear and extends beyond tech too An American exchange-traded fund targeting the 100 companies in the Russell 1000 index with the highest free-cashflow yields is up by about 8% this year The shift towards a cash-focused equity market will be felt most acutely in tech however precisely because it was where the excesses of the previous regime were so evident The beneficiaries of the new preference for cash generation include hardware firms such as ibm and hp the share prices of which have risen since November These had free-cashflow yields of 10% and 12% respectivelyfar above the 3% yield for tech firms worldwide The parts of the sector that will suffer are those where cash generation has long been a problem Ride-hailing is a prime example The share prices of Uber and Lyft two American firms and Grab based in South-East Asia are all down by 40-60% so far this year Uber which recorded negative free cashflow on average between 2019 and 2021 is very much a hare by our classification Last month Dara Khosrowshahi its chief executive told employees that the company would now focus explicitly on generating positive cashflow There are other areas where the renewed attention to cash could pose a problem for tech firms in particular The prevalence of stock-based compensation is one Paying employees in stock options does not register in cashflow reporting in the way that conventional pay would because it is a non-cash expense Research published last year by Morgan Stanley a bank notes that the median stock-based payout of tech firms in the Russell 1000 runs to around 25% of cashflow before capital investment more than three times the level for any other sector The same analysis finds that Amazon free cashflow would have been reduced by almost one-third in 2020 if stock-based compensation had been counted as cashflow These sorts of divergences may prompt investors to try ever harder to paint a more accurate picture of cash generation With inflation running high and no immediate return to the era of easy money in prospect cash could start to rule everything around techRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The return of the inventory cycle Jun 2ndIs China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 6th 2022,Could seizing Russian assets help rebuild Ukraine?,In 2011 viktor vekselberg a metals tycoon and Kremlin insider visited the team designing the Tango a $90m yacht he had ordered to oversee its construction His attention to detail proved his undoing When Mr Vekselberg came under American sanctions in 2018 his foreign assets were frozenbut not the Tango which was held via a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands Then two engineers at the shipyard remembering the meeting in 2011 tipped off the fbi A trail of money transfers confirmed that Mr Vekselberg did indeed own the Tango On April 4th this year Spanish police acting at America request seized the boat in MallorcaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNetting the Tango was a coup for KleptoCapture a task force set up by Joe Biden America president to track the assets of oligarchs blacklisted by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine The eu has captured about $7bn in art boats and property; Italy has impounded a $700m superyacht said to be linked to Vladimir Putin; America has held about $1bn in vessels and aircraft Add in the chunk of the Russian central bank currency reserves that have come under Western sanctions and nearly $400bn in assets have been blocked According to the Kyiv School of Economics the total economic damage to Ukraine so far could amount to as much as $600bn To many therefore the idea of seizing Russian assets selling them and using the proceeds to compensate the victims of Mr Putin aggression seems irresistible Charles Michel the head of the European Council for instance has argued that “it is extremely important not only to freeze assets but also to make it possible to confiscate them to make them available for rebuilding Ukraine” The idea has gained support from politicians everywhere from Canada to Germany But there are two big obstacles to the plan: the practical difficulties of freezing assets and the legal difficulties of seizing themConsider the practicalities of freezing assets first The central bank currency reserves are a relatively straightforward target More than half of Russia reserves are held in the West and are subject to sanctions So far however this giant stash is “hindered” not technically frozen: transactions with the central bank are prohibited but its funds are not legally blocked That means Western countries are an extra step away from being able to seize the money says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn a law firm Ukraine allies could decide to take that step as America did when it froze the Afghan central bank reserves last year after the Taliban entered KabulPrivate assets are harder to target Russia stock of foreign direct investment amounts to some $500bn But little of this is subject to freezes says Rachel Ziemba of cnas an American think-tank One problem is that it is hard to know where the investment is based: its recorded location is often Cyprus but that tends to be only an intermediate stop Freezes have therefore focused on individuals instead Here too tracking down assets is tricky Anders Aslund a former adviser to the Russian and Ukrainian governments estimates that Russians under sanctions hold some $400bn of assets abroad But he says only $50bn of that is frozen Having been targeted by sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 the wiliest oligarchs now hide their foreign assets behind 20-30 layers of shell companies Some physical assets have been moved to friendlier territory More than 100 Russian private jets landed in Dubai in the weeks after the invasion of Ukraine Moreover the enforcement of sanctions falls on the private firmsfrom banks to marinasthat serve the rich Not all have the expertise to see through tycoons’ obfuscation Whoever freezes the assets may also have to look after them which drains resources Houses need to be tended to; yachts cost 10% of their value in yearly maintenance These difficulties pale into insignificance when compared with the problems of confiscationthe next step if Russian assets are to be used to rebuild Ukraine In Western democracies seizing foreign property on the basis of nationality or political opinion is illegal That is not to say there are no precedents for the expropriation of both state and private assets But they have taken place at extraordinary times and when certain strict criteria have been met Seize and desist When it comes to individuals the typical condition for confiscation is a criminal convictionnot just for any crime but those that are deemed to warrant seizure The forfeited assets must either be determined an instrument of the crime or linked to the proceeds from it Such things can take years and a lot of money to be proved in court And the hurdle is unlikely to disappear soon: a bill introduced in the us Senate in April that would have granted the president powers to confiscate oligarchs’ assets was soundly defeated after the American Civil Liberties Union warned it would probably be struck down in court Officials in the West are therefore instead working to lengthen the list of crimes that warrant seizure In April the Biden administration introduced a bill that would add sanction and export-controls evasion to the list of offences punishable by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act which was passed in 1970 to crack down on mobsters and allows for ill-gotten gains to be seized On May 25th the European Commission outlined plans to make it easier for member countries to confiscate assets belonging to individuals suspected of breaching sanctionsEach proposal faces a tough political battle Although most Republicans support bashing Russia few want to give Mr Biden a victory ahead of the mid-term elections in November The eu will have no power to tell member governments how to use the proceeds from the liquidated assets Some countries will be wary of confiscation: Germany may have to amend its constitution which guarantees private property; Cyprus and Malta which act as transit hubs for Russian money are unlikely to support seizuresThe confiscation of state assets meanwhile would require Western governments to designate Russia a hostile power or to call for regime change which they have shied away from doing so far As a rule the doctrine of “sovereign immunity” enshrined by a un convention protects foreign states from local prosecution But some laws most notably in America allow the government to seize foreign state assets without trial in certain cases One such law is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ieepa which provides legal backing for the current freezes It does not explicitly grant the president powers to “vest” assetsie to change who owns them But one exception added in 2001 allows for some vesting when America is engaged in “armed hostilities” with another country This was used by George W Bush to seize Iraqi assets after he invaded the country in 2003 Today however America is at pains to emphasise that its shipments of weapons to Ukraine do not equate to its being in armed conflict with Russia Saying otherwise could become “the actual reason for war” notes Antonia Tzinova of Holland & Knight another law firmSeizures can happen outside ieepa America executive branch has the authority to transfer control of certain foreign state assets when it changes what it considers to be the legitimate governmentas it did in 2019 when it confiscated Venezuelan assets after recognising Juan Guaidó as president But America has so far fallen short of calling for Mr Putin to go Under rare circumstances Congress can also lift the immunity of sovereign states allowing their assets to compensate claimants in a domestic trial One chunk of the frozen Afghan assets has been set aside while courts hear from the families of the victims of the September 11th attacks For this to apply to Russia though America would have to declare it a terrorist state The eu for its part is not even discussing the matter of sovereign assets points out Jan Dunin-Wasowicz of Hughes Hubbard & Reed a law firm Mentions of them are conspicuously absent from its proposals International courts do not appear to be a fruitful avenue either Neither Russia nor Ukraine have consented to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice save for a few narrow exceptions says Astrid Coracini of the University of Vienna A newly created body akin to a commission set up by the un in 1991 to seek reparations from Iraq after it invaded Kuwait would require Russia consentCreative ideas are therefore springing up One is to target the billions of dollars a day that Russia receives for its energy exports rather than its stock of assets In a meeting of the g7 countries in May America proposed levying a tariff on Russian oil the proceeds of which could then be sent to Ukraine But achieving agreement even within the eu will be a tall order Another scheme would funnel payments for Russian oil to escrow accounts at international banks as happened with Iranian crude in the 2010s The accumulated bounty worth around $100bn became available again to Iran after sanctions were lifted in 2016 This time the West could demand that some of the money be donated to Ukraine One insider suspects the idea is being considered in Washington Russia could however try to wind down its remaining oil sales to the West Enforcing the measure more widely meanwhile would require transgressors to be threatened with “secondary” sanctionssomething that the West has so far avoided All this suggests that attempts to seize Russian assets while the war rages will struggle to avoid one of three pitfalls Unless Western countries ditch the protections they offer to foreign individuals and states they risk spending many years in court If they do ditch them however the trust underpinning their economies and societies could be endangered More creative ideas meanwhile may invite Russian retaliation and anger the rest of the worldThat does not mean Russian treasure will remain untouchable for ever Most reparations tend to be agreed once war ends often as a condition for unfreezing foreign assets Mr Putin still seems far from considering peace But if he ever comes round to it letting some money go to Ukraine may be the price he has to pay for seeing some of his own assetsincluding maybe a multi-million-dollar superyachtreturn home Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter 
 Jun 5th 2022,Europe economy grapples with an acute energy shock,For the best part of a decade rock-bottom interest rates seemed like a fact of life in the euro zoneas did low inflation Now consumer prices are rising at an annual rate exceeding 8% well above the European Central Bank target of 2% Members of the bank governing council have signalled their intent to raise rates soon a message they were expected to reaffirm at a monetary-policy meeting on June 9th as we went to press But the ecb finds itself in a tricky position: of contending not only with surging prices which might warrant rapid rate rises but also gloomier growth prospects which might warrant patience Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe root cause of both developments is a severe energy-price crunch Prices of oil and natural gas had already been rising before Russia invasion of Ukraine; the war sent them soaring higher still These price rises have played a much bigger role in pushing up consumer-price inflation in Europe than in America where stimulus has also been a culprit Energy prices in the euro areawhich rose at a whopping annual rate of 39% in Mayare contributing about four percentage points to headline inflation compared with two in AmericaThe effects are starting to spill over to other prices “Core” inflation which excludes food and energy prices was higher in the euro zone in May than economists had expected German producer prices rose at a record clip of 335% in April compared with last year driven not just by energy but also energy-intensive goods such as concrete and chemicals The result is a big hit to firms’ costs and households’ purchasing power In how much danger does it put the euro area economy? One consequence of the energy shock is lower household incomes in real terms Wage growth has been picking up modestly across the zone but still trails behind inflation Some employers have made one-off payments to workers to compensate them for surging prices without incurring higher recurring wage costs Even then however annual pay growth in the Netherlands where the labour market is tight stood at just 28% in May In one sense this is good news for the ecb because it reduces the risk of a wage-price spiral But it may feed into lower consumption weakening the rest of the economy in turnA moderation in demand only adds to a heap of woes for the manufacturing sector where confidence is already in steep decline Supply disruptions as a result of China recent lockdowns and high energy prices are hurting businesses with Germany and eastern Europe looking most vulnerable to an industrial slowdown New orders for the zone manufacturers in May fell for the first time since June 2020 indicating weaker demand Export orders declined at their fastest pace in two years Economists are therefore pencilling in slower growth over the rest of the year But few expect an outright recession just yet That is because some parts of the economy confront the energy shock from a position of strength rather than weakness Many services firms are still reaping the rewards from the end of Omicron-related lockdowns Southern countries are benefiting the most given their reliance on tourism; in Spain arrivals of sun-seeking northerners almost reached pre-pandemic levels in April Overall business sentiment in services remains strong with many firms reporting a growing backlog of work Jobs are still plentiful too Across the bloc there were three vacancies for every 100 jobs in the first quarter of 2022 a high level by historical standards Firms’ hiring expectations are solid albeit slightly weaker since the start of the war in Ukraine More than one in four businesses in Europe say that a lack of staff is preventing them from producing moreA hoard of savings built up during lockdowns should also provide consumers with some cushion against the energy shock According to our calculations such “excess” savings in France and Germany amounted to a tenth of disposable incomes in the first quarter of 2022 see chart These buffers will blunt the impact of the energy shock But they will not offset it altogether Excess savings for a start are not evenly distributed Poorer people in rich countries and most households in poorer countries have precious little left In Slovakia for example the savings rate never rose much during the pandemic “Consumption weakness will come from lower-income households” says Jens Eisenschmidt of Morgan Stanley a bank Retail sales in real terms have moved sideways for monthsMany governments have put together spending programmes to shield households from high energy prices According to Bruegel a think-tank in Brussels Germany France and others are spending between 1% and 2% of gdp Not all of that is well-targeted however Much of it is going on relief for better-off households that do not need it; other measures have involved meddling with prices with some of the benefit going to energy suppliersEven if the euro area is spared a recession then the energy shock will be a drag on growth The ecb faces an unenviable dilemma With every increase in inflation on the back of food and energy prices the European economy is getting weaker For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 2nd 2022,China dilemma over a curious breed of financial firm,China local-government financiers have a complex identity Tasked with developing land and doing public works they act on behalf of and with approval from city and provincial authorities Yet at the same time they represent large companies known as local-government financing vehicles lgfvs which have the ability to raise billions of dollars from global investors The thousands of lgfvs around the country owed an estimated 53trn yuan $83trn equivalent to 52% of annual gdp in debts last year Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKConflicts of interest have naturally arisen for the bosses of these hybrid firms In some cases they have been caught giving chummy private companies lucrative stakes in government projects Others have used their official status to guarantee bank loans for friends In Sichuan province a government financier was recently found to have lent out state funds to private firms at rates as high as 20% a year In Hunan province a boss was caught charging companies that work with the government consulting and paperwork fees Such practices might fly in the private sectorbut not with anti-corruption investigatorsThe central government is taking new interest in such dodgy dealings More than 40 high-ranking officials at lgfvs have been put under investigation or detained since the start of the year The Ministry of Finance has warned provincial authorities about the risks associated with corruption in the quasi-state sector The renewed attention on graft at lgfvs betrays growing concerns about the role the companies play in generating economic growth along with the piles of debt they have amassed in the processlgfvs are a uniquely Chinese problem Invented in the 1990s to get round rules that banned local governments from raising debt the companies became one of the most important sources of economic growth over the past two decades as they carried out vast numbers of public projects Their status as non-government entities allowed them to borrow heavily from investors in China and abroad One of the oddities of lgfvs is that it is city and provincial authorities that are on the hook for those debts But lgfvs’ borrowings are not included in official government budgets making it hard to gauge riskThe latest scrutiny brings with it two complications For a start it comes at an awkward moment The economy has been hit hard by recent lockdowns to contain covid-19 In response China leaders have announced plans for infrastructure spending this year to help achieve a lofty gdp-growth target of 55% lgfvs would typically play a key role in funding and contracting much of the building activity across the country But the crackdown on corruption and other restrictions means that managers will be less likely to take risks Normally this would be considered a good thing This time however an unwillingness to take on new projects could come at the cost of precious gdp growth at a time when the Communist Party can ill afford itMoreover tighter oversight has had the unintended effect of exposing lgfvs to currency risk The firms must gain regulatory approval to issue bonds within China Greater scrutiny over their use of funds has led to onshore-debt issuance by lgfvs falling by 22% in the first four months of 2022 compared with the same period last year This has pushed the companies into the riskier offshore market: dollar-bond issuance by lgfvs soared by about 150% during the same period according to Pengyuan a rating agency But few of these companies earn dollar revenues making it harder to repay the bonds A default would send a shock wave through the bond market Such dangers explain why Beijing technocrats want to reduce the importance of lgfvs especially as local governments can now issue bonds directly reducing the need for fiddly workarounds For as long as the growth target is in peril though lgfvs will be going nowhere For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 2nd 2022,The return of the inventory cycle,Remember the Great Moderation? This refers to the period before the global financial crisis of 2007-09 during which there was a marked fall in the volatility of gdp growth in rich countries Explanations for it ranged from wiser monetary policy yes really to globalisation In fact much of it was down to something more mundane: smaller inventories One authoritative study found that more than half the improvement in the stability of rich-world growth was explained by diminished inventory cyclesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe classic stockbuilding cycle in which inventory changes add to the momentum of gdp on the way up through over-ordering and on the way down through stock clearances is showing signs of a revival Some big American retailers notably Walmart have reported large increases in stocks In part this is the result of errors in forecasting demand But it also reflects an increase in the desired level of inventories As just-in-time production gives way to just-in-case stockpiling the scope for greater volatility in gdp and in corporate earnings is increasingTo understand why inventories are rising again it helps first to understand why they fell Improvements in computing mean that firms have more detailed and timelier information about demand from consumers Such changes made large precautionary stockholdings redundant A related factor is carrying cost Interest rates were high in the 1980s when businesses first began to favour leaner inventories And a dollar in stock is a dollar that cannot be used profitably elsewhere Accompanying this was the widespread adoption of just-in-time manufacturing with its emphasis on flexible supplyFor the leanest companies inventory consists of whatever FedEx or ups is carrying for them Or it did until recently The tech-and-trade wars between America and China challenged assumptions about the security of supply The pandemic and now the war in Ukraine upset them completely The pattern of demand suddenly shifted as locked-down consumers could not spend on dining out or live entertainment; instead they spent more on goods that could be ordered online and delivered to their door Meanwhile shortages of workers and of key inputs notably semiconductors meant that some orders could not be fulfilled Businesses lost sales for want of inventory Logistical snafus became a board-level discussionThe result inevitably has been an overcorrection Having lagged behind spending inventories got ahead of it The share prices of Walmart and Target fell sharply in mid-May when the two retailers revealed they had been left with large stocks of unsold goods after misjudging the strength of demand Even the mighty Amazon has been blindsided as the e-commerce share of retail sales which exploded in the pandemic has fallen back towards its pre-covid trend The cyclical effects of all this will have to be reckoned with Some retailers may be holding the wrong stock for the time of year They will either have to store it mark down prices to clear it quickly or move it on to discount retailers that specialise in selling out-of-season stock Inflation will be lower than it would otherwise have been Some companies that have over-ordered will cut back on purchases to allow stock levels to adjust to the trend in spending Albert Edwards of Société Générale a French bank reckons that the pain will be felt more in China as “demand for Chinese imports gets hit hard just when the Chinese authorities are struggling to revive their moribund economy”Yet there is something more profound at play Just-in-time production assumes a largely frictionless worldof open borders predictable demand and low transport costs This can no longer be relied upon Inventory is a form of insurance against unexpected delays And though insurance is costly company bosses seem willing to pay for more of it The trade-off between efficiency and self-insurance between just-in-time and just-in-case has shifted markedly towards the latter And larger inventories imply greater scope for inventory cycles in the futureThere is a paradox here The more companies seek to self-insure by holding more stocks the more volatile gdp and thus corporate earnings is likely to become over time American retailing might thus be offering a preview of a particular futureof jumpier revenues and more frequent profit warnings The Great Moderation is going into reverse Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Is China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 2nd 2022,Should China spend more on infrastructure?,Rarely can so much have been used by so few During Shanghai long lockdown which mercifully eased this week the city impressive infrastructure stood in splendid isolation from most of the citizens it is meant to serve The metro all 831km of it was eerily quiet The two airports which handled 120m passengers in 2019 operated at 99% below their normal level The famous mag-lev train neither magnetised nor levitated Six-lane highways provided an ocean of road space for handfuls of scooters China is renowned for creating “ghost cities”: new sparsely populated districts that gradually come to life as people move into them Shanghai lockdown reversed this process turning a lively metropolis into something undead Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis surreal underuse of existing infrastructure notwithstanding the government best hope for reviving the economy is to add more of it Much more Spending on transport water conservation and renovating old neighbourhoods will be a “strong driving force” for the economy helping to employ China 290m migrant workers said Li Keqiang the prime minister in an emergency teleconference with thousands of local officials on May 25th The government will also “vigorously” promote 102 “major projects” listed in the country five-year plan such as flood prevention ultra-high-voltage power lines and four-lane expresswaysincluding one to a city in Yunnan renamed Shangri-LaIf Omicron resurges recurring lockdowns may prevent China spending its way out of trouble this year But even if everything goes to plan a successful stimulus will raise a deeper question Does China need all that additional infrastructure? Or will the extra spending leave behind superfluous “white elephants” as undisturbed by human traffic as the airports roads and railways of locked-down Shanghai?The question is tricky to answer because infrastructure in China is hard to measure or even define The definition used by the National Bureau of Statistics nbs often leaves out areas such as gas and electricity as well as social sectors like education and health care Worse the official investment figures designed with central planners in mind are not consistent with modern national accounting Nor owing to shifts in classification and reporting thresholds are they consistent with themselves over time As Carsten Holz of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology once noted if one intended to make this data “as unusable as possible one could probably not do a better job than the nbs does”In a paper published by the World Bank in 2020 Richard Herd nonetheless estimates that China stock of infrastructure and government capital rose from 64% of gdp on the eve of the global financial crisis in 2007 to 107% in 2016 the most recent figure in his paper This new prominence of infrastructure and housing in Chinese investment may help explain the country productivity slowdown over the past decade Another measure by the imf adds up all the investment undertaken by China central and local governments According to this method the stock of public capital was even larger: 151% of gdp in 2019 among the highest shares in the world Both of these measures compare the scale of China infrastructure with the size of its gdp This convention makes some sense: a bigger economy needs a larger backbone to support it Conversely a small economy where people are few in number or limited in their means can fit into a smaller infrastructural frame If few people can afford cars flights or smartphones a country will have less need of roads airports and 5g towers According to this logic infrastructure is a kind of “input” that should be sized according to the scale of production But gdp is not the only relevant comparison Indeed saying that a country infrastructure should be kept in proportion to its gdp is tantamount to saying that poor countries should have poor infrastructure Some common components of infrastructure are more like amenities than inputs to production A cleaner environment a faster bus trip or a more comfortable train journey are things people of all income levels can appreciate On this view what matters is the amount of infrastructure per person regardless of their incomeSadly China infrastructure is less impressive when compared with the size of its vast population For example it has 120km of motorways per 1m people compared with 179km in France and 326km in America And it has 106km of railway per 1m people compared with 236km in Britain and over 400km in Germany China metro lines are more than 20 times as long as those in France But China population living in cities of over 500000 people is also more than 20 times as large China also has only 44 intensive-care beds for every 100000 people according to some estimates compared with 14 in Americaa catastrophic shortage of medical infrastructure that helps explain its lack of tolerance for covid outbreaks Indeed there are 37 economies in the imf database that have a higher stock of public capital per person than China Presumably those economies do not think that their extra infrastructure is entirely superfluous The longer road to Shangri-LaCritics of China proposed infrastructure stimulus worry that it will crowd out other more productive forms of spending But in China covid-wracked economy other spending is unusually weak Without government help the level of demand might not be enough to fully employ the country labour and capital including its existing infrastructure A recession can impose the same kind of compulsory idleness on an economy as a lockdown The time and energy that China workers will devote to extending power networks waterways and roads to Shangri-La might otherwise be lost to the economy for ever Wasteful spending is a curse in China But underspending can be the most elephantine waste of all Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How economic interdependence fosters alliances and democracy May 28thHow to unleash more investment in intangible assets May 21stThe world needs a new economic motor Could India fit the bill?

 Jun 1st 2022,What America next recession will look like,These days it is hard to turn a corner without bumping into predictions of an American recession Big banks prominent economists and former officials are all saying that a downturn is a near certainty as the Federal Reserve wrestles inflation under control Three-quarters of chief executives of Fortune 500 companies are braced for growth to go negative before the end of 2023 Bond yields and consumer surveys are flashing red Google searches for “recession” are soaring Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe track record is certainly ominous As Larry Summers a former treasury secretary has observed whenever inflation has risen above 4% and unemployment has dipped below 4%two thresholds that when breached indicate economic overheatingAmerica has suffered a recession within two years It is well across both thresholds now For much of last year the Fed and investors alike believed that inflation would fade as the pandemic subsided No one believes that now There is broad agreement that supply snarls and energy-price surges notwithstanding demand is also excessive and that tighter monetary policy is needed to return it to a normal level The question is how tight and therefore how much the economy could suffer: the higher the Fed has to raise rates the more punishing the downturn will be Investors are pricing in pain as indicated by the fall in stocks since the start of the yearIf America does slip into a recession how might it play out? One way of trying to divine the path of a downturn is to consult history America has suffered 12 recessions since 1945 Many observers point to similarities between today predicament and the early 1980s when Paul Volcker Fed crushed inflation causing a deep recession in the process Others look at the downturn that followed the energy crises of the 1970s echoed by the surge in oil and food prices today Still others point to the dotcom bust in 2000 mirrored by the collapse in tech stocks this yearBut these parallels have serious flaws Inflation is nowhere near as entrenched as at the start of Mr Volcker era Growth is far less energy-intensive than in the 1970s And the economy faces more complex crosswinds now than it did after the bust of 2000 The unusual nature of the deep covid-induced downturn in 2020 and the roaring recovery in 2021 when fiscal and monetary stimulus flooded the economy limits the relevance of past episodesA better way to think about a recession if it comes is to look at America as it is today Consider three different facets: the real economy the financial system and the central bank All three working in concert suggest that a recession would be relatively mild Households and businesses’ balance-sheets are mostly strong Risks in the financial system appear to be manageable The Fed for its part has been too slow to respond to inflation but the credibility it has built up over the past few decades means it can still fight an effective rearguard action There is however a sting in the tail: when the recession ultimately ends the consequences of the past few years of living dangerously with inflation may make for a sluggish recoveryStart with the resilience of the real economy which may well be the most important line of defence in a downturn The general population is on a sound financial footing a welcome change from the overextended consumers of the past Household debt is about 75% of gdp down from 100% on the eve of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 Even more striking is how much less Americans pay annually to service their debts Because so many have shifted to cheaper mortgages as interest rates have fallen in recent years their annual debt payments now add up to about 9% of disposable income about the lowest since data were first collected in 1980Moreover many households have larger-than-normal cash buffers thanks to the stimulus payments of the past two years plus their reduced spending on travel restaurants and the like at the height of the pandemic Overall Americans have excess savings of about $2trn 9% of gdp compared with before covid They have started to use some of this cash as living costs rise but still retain a useful cushionIn any recession one big concern is how many people will lose their jobs Unemployment tends to rise during recessions: in the median post-1945 downturn in America excluding the brief covid recession the peak jobless rate rose by nearly three percentage points see chart 1 A rise in unemployment seems more economically necessary today as a way to relieve some of the upward pressure on wages and dampen inflation Could things play out differently though? The labour market has by some measures never been so tight: a record 19 jobs are available for every unemployed person This has fuelled optimism that companies could in effect cancel their job ads without firing people Jerome Powell chairman of the Fed has expressed this hope “There a path by which we would be able to moderate demand in the labour market and have vacancies go down without having unemployment going up” he said on May 4th Hurting me softlyIn practice though the labour market is unlikely to adjust so smoothly Mr Summers has drawn attention to the concept of the Beveridge curve which portrays a basic relationship: the more vacancies there are the lower the unemployment rate Since the onset of the pandemic the curve has shifted outwards see chart 2 In other words it now seems to require more vacancies to get to the same unemployment rates as in the pastan indication of faltering efficiency in the economy ability to match the right people with the right jobs One possible explanation is that some people are still reluctant to work because of the health risks from covid Another is regional variation: some states like Utah and Nebraska have giant needs for workers but not enough people are willing to move to themWhatever the precise reason the implication is that it is too optimistic to think that the Fed tightening can reduce vacancies without also reducing employment Yet that does not mean that Mr Powell is all wrong The Beveridge curve could also move back as the recovery progresses and more people re-enter the workforce Say the unemployment rate increases by two percentage points instead of the nearly three points in the median recession That would take the rate to about 55% lower than the average of the past three decades Though painful for those who end up on the dole it would be a good outcome as far as recessions go By contrast 11% of Americans were out of work by the time Mr Volcker had finished tightening Even if most people are fairly well insulated from a recession they are still likely to curtail their spending as the economy goes south Belt-tightening would in turn translate into less revenue for businesses A key question is how those lower earnings will interact with high debt levels: unlike households companies have ramped up their borrowing over the past decade Non-financial business debt stands at about 75% of gdp not far from a record highReassuringly many companies sought to lock in rock-bottom rates during the pandemic In 2021 companies reduced debt coming due this year by about 27% or $250bn mainly by refinancing their existing debt at lower rates and for longer durations That makes them less sensitive to an increase in interest ratesLess reassuringly riskier companies also took advantage of easy money Bonds that are rated bbb the lowest rung of investment-grade debt now account for a record 57% of the investment-grade bond market up from 40% in 2007 When a recession strikes the ratings on many of these bonds could slip a notch or two And when bonds go from investment-grade to speculative or junk status they become far less appealing for a universe of investors such as pension funds and insurance firms That increases the chances of a flight to safety when the mood sours Even so thanks to the starting point of low funding costs there are limits to how bad things might get In a pessimistic scenariowhere a recession collides with higher input costs and rising interest ratess&p a rating agency forecasts that about 6% of speculative-grade corporate bonds will go into default next year That would be well up from the 15% rate now but half the 12% rate in 2009 Intriguingly the sector today holding the most low-quality debt is media and entertainment featuring many leisure companies such as cruise lines A recession would sap demand for their services But as worries about covid recede there is also a pent-up desire to get out and have fun again The paradoxical result is that a swathe of low-rated companies may be positioned to fare better than most during a downturnHow well fortified is the financial system America second facet? Headlines in recent years about Basel 3 capital standards for banks may have caused more than a few pairs of eyes to glaze over But these rules have served a purpose forcing large financial firms to hold more capital and more liquid assets Banks went into 2007 with core loss-absorbing equity worth about 8% of their risk-weighted assets Today it is more like 13% a much plumper margin of safety “A recession would not look like it did after the financial crisis The system is just not levered like it was back then” says Jay Bryson of Wells Fargo a bankNew threats have inevitably emerged Prudential regulations have pushed risky activities into darker corners of the financial system Non-bank lenders for instance issued about 70% of all mortgages last year up from 30% a decade ago Ideally that would spread risks away from banks But bank lending to these non-banks has also boomed creating a web of opaque linkages Insurers hedge funds and family officesin effect investment firms for the ultra-richhave also taken on additional risks They carry more debt than 15 years ago and are among the biggest investors in lower-rated corporate bondsEmblematic of the new kind of danger are collateralised loan obligations clos These are typically created by syndicating loans pooling them and then dividing them into securities with different ratings depending on their payment profiles The value of outstanding clos has reached about $850bn making it the biggest securitised credit market in America And high-risk leveraged loans form a growing share of clos which are partly converted into investment-grade assets through the alchemy of securitisation The parallels with the dodgy mortgage-backed securities of the financial crisis are obvious Yet the similarities can also be overstated The clo market is about half the size of the riskiest mortgage-securities market in the early 2000s clos connect investors to a wide range of industries not just property They also tend to be longer-term investments more resistant to market ups and downsMoreover an important stabiliser for the financial system will be the relative solidity of America most important asset market: property An exuberant surge in house prices over the past two years means a decline in sales and values may be on the cards But property is also dramatically undersupplied Sam Khater of Freddie Mac a government-backed mortgage firm estimates that America has a shortage of nearly 4m homes because of a slowdown in building over the past 15 years It is far better for the financial system to enter a recession with a giant underinvestment backlog than with an overinvestment hangover as was the case in 2007The final factor in assessing the impact of a recession is monetary policy As of March the median forecast by members of the Fed rate-setting committee was that inflation would fall to close to 2% in 2024 without interest rates having to exceed 3% It seems a fair bet that rates will go quite a bit higher James Bullard the relatively hawkish president of the St Louis Fed reckons that the central bank will need to increase rates to 35% by the end of this year A simple rule of thumb which combines the Fed desired real rate of interest and expected inflation suggests even higher nominal rates may be needed If the real neutral rate which neither stimulates nor restrains growth is 05% then the Fed would probably want to hit a real rate of about 15% to rein in inflation Add on short-term inflation expectations of 4% per year as indicated by consumer surveys at present and that suggests that the Fed may need to lift its nominal rate to 55% “There is a substantially greater probability that we’ll need higher rates than the Fed now envisions or the market now predicts” says Mr SummersPut differently the Fed is embarking on a journey with a clear destination low inflation an obvious vehicle interest rates but hazy guesses about how to get there how high rates must go It will know the correct path only by moving forward and seeing how the economy reacts It has barely taken its first steps raising rates by three-quarters of a percentage point over the past three months and setting out a plan for shrinking its assets But it may be pleased with the results so far clearly visible as financial markets rush to price in future tighteningFor all the Fed missteps of the past year investors still have respect for it a precious legacy of the past four decades starting with Mr Volcker leadership in which it kept a lid on inflation Equities which were looking bubbly have tumbled in value The impact on mortgages has been dramatic: 30-year fixed rates have risen above 5% the highest in more than a decade Yet credit spreads have widened only somewhat an indication that lending markets are not too stressed Taken together this looks like an orderly sell-off and an early success for the Fed Although inflation expectations as measured by bond pricing still point to annual inflation of 3% over the next five years they have come down by about half a percentage point since MarchMr Bullard case for optimism is that much of the work of taming inflation can be done by resetting expectations at a lower level The real economy would then not need to bear the weight of the adjustment The key objective for the Fed is therefore to prove to investors that its vows to quash inflation are credible “It is more game theory and less econometrics” he says The Fed record over the past couple of months since belatedly training its sights on inflation opens up the possibility that it may be able to tame prices without a punishingly high increase in rates That in turn would make for a lighter recessionWhy worry then? For one thing even a mild recession hurts Imagine the unemployment rate does rise by two percentage points as in our relatively hopeful scenario That would imply job losses for about 3m Americans The political consequences may be even more dramatic The recession in 1990 shows up as a mere blip in economic trends but it helped pave the way for Bill Clinton victory over George HW Bush A mild recession in 2023 could put paid to Joe Biden beleaguered presidency perhaps helping usher Donald Trump back into the White HouseThis will make the policy response to a looming recession much more controversial If as expected the Republicans seize control of Congress from the Democrats in mid-term elections this November there would be little chance of a muscular fiscal stimulus as growth slows Republicans would see little reason to bail out Mr Biden especially if the financial system holds upThe task of easing would fall squarely on the Fed But having just fought to contain an overheating economy and bring inflation to heel the central bank would be queasy about revving up demand too much And if the current cycle of rate increases stops at a low level the Fed would not have much room to cut rates anyway The next step would be once again to unleash quantitative easing ie purchasing assets such as government bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates It would however be fearful of the optics of “printing money” so soon after whipping inflation and just as a contentious election campaign gets under wayThe upshot is that policymakers are likely to have a limited arsenal if the next recession is just round the corner Given the strengths of the economy todayflush consumers solid businesses and safe banksthe next downturn ought to be mild But even a mild recession must be followed by an upturn for the economy to return to full health And with fiscal policy on the sidelines and monetary policy badly hobbled the chances are that America would face a painfully slow recovery After two years of focusing on high inflation low growth may move back to centre-stage as the economy principal problem For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 31st 2022,Why the oil price is spiking again,In the 1970s Arab states used the “oil weapon” of embargoes to punish Western governments for supporting Israel On May 30th the heads of the 27 eu member governments agreed to turn the weapon on themselves as part of a fresh round of sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine As well as cutting off Sberbank Russia largest bank from the swift cross-border payment system the package will also ban purchases of Russian crude oil and refined products such as diesel by the end of the year There would the eu said be a “temporary” exemption for oil delivered through pipelines The price of a barrel of Brent crude leapt above $120 on the news its highest level since MarchListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn principle the decision is highly significant As well as demonstrating unity and the bloc willingness to bear economic pain to punish Russia it cuts one of the few remaining trade ties with the Kremlin It also imperils one of Russia most lucrative sources of foreign-currency earnings The eu is Russia biggest market for crude buying about half the country oil exports There are reasons however to be sceptical that the move will deprive the Kremlin of much foreign currency For a start the ban applies only to seaborne oil transported via tankers That is the price of unity: excluding oil delivered by pipelines was necessary to find a compromise with Hungary which is both more sympathetic to Russia than most eu countries and critically dependent on the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline a name meaning “friendship” in Russian Hungary imports about 65% of its crude from RussiaSeaborne oil makes up a similar share of Europe imports from Russia But the ban is likely to have a limited impact on the oil market Many tankers are already subject to “self-sanctioning” in parts of the West Dockworkers have refused to unload ships carrying Russian cargoes and oil majors have been worried about the hit to their reputations from accepting shipments Western financiers are stepping back from writing insurance contracts Insurers based in Russia allies could partly replace them but have shallower pockets A big question is whether Russian seaborne crude once placed under sanctions will go unsold So far Russia oil exports have risen even as the country has come under sanctions According to analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank much of the increase has gone to India which has not issued sanctions of its own Another question is whether Europe does eventually ban piped Russian oil which is harder to redirect to other countries Poland and Germany have said they will cease importing via the Druzhba pipeline Yet it is hard to imagine Hungary dropping its opposition to a wider ban Viktor Orban the country populist prime minister has demonstrated his willingness to block eu decisions before Thanks to a hefty discount on Russian crudethe Urals benchmark is trading significantly below Brentmol a Hungarian oil group reports “skyrocketing” marginsPartial though the embargo may be such is the tightness of the oil market that prices still surged Demand for fuel is strong as the pandemic subsides and consumers start driving and flying again and as governments try to shield voters from the impact of higher energy costs China easing of coronavirus restrictions in recent days has also added to the thirst for oil The prices of industrial metals including iron ore and copper have rallied too Meanwhile the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries opec and its allies which include Russia have shown little sign of increasing production just yet The group was due to meet on June 2nd as we went to press and was not expected to depart from its plan to gradually increase supply to levels seen before the pandemic although prices dipped on reports that it was mulling a plan to exclude Russia from its production targets allowing Saudi Arabia and others to pump more to make up for any lost output Tight supply and robust demand together translate into higher prices for consumers at the pump To make matters worse a shortage of refinery capacity in America has raised prices for petrol and diesel even further than the cost of crude The surging dollar adds to costs for Europe and emerging markets notes Francisco Blanch of Bank of America None of this is welcome news in an already inflationary environment According to figures published on May 31st inflation in the euro area rose to 81% in the year to May higher than economists had expectedThe Arab embargoes of the 1970s caused short-term pain for the West but also spurred a drive for fuel efficiency that ultimately reduced its reliance on oil European governments today may find themselves hoping that the short-term pain for consumers similarly gives way to the long-term gain of energy security Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

 May 29th 2022,The changing American consumer,Asked recently about Amazon sprawling network of warehouses Brian Olsavsky the firm finance chief did not mince words “We have too much space right now” As consumer demand surged during the pandemic the online retailer doubled its capacity from 193m square feet 18m square metres at the end of 2019 to 387m square feet two years later Today it has a glut which the company says is costing it tens of millions of dollars a day Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRetailers are bracing themselves for a slowdown as central banks raise interest rates But Amazon troubles reflect another crucial development for the global economy: a shift in spending from goods back to services reversing a pandemic-era trend This switch should ease pressure on global supply chains and lower inflation But it has been slow and uneven Confined to their homes during the worst of the pandemic consumers in the rich world splurged on appliances cars and furniture The binge was most notable in America where it was fuelled by three rounds of “stimmy” cheques People bought substitutes for the services they could no longer enjoyan exercise bike say to make up for closed gyms Perhaps as a result of having a little extra cash they also treated themselves to things like watches and luxury products A year into the pandemic the composition of consumer spending had changed dramatically By spring 2021 goods accounted for 42% of household spending in America up from 36% before the pandemic; services accounted for 58% down from 64% a drop worth more than $900bn per year Several other Western countries experienced a similar rise in goods consumption though few witnessed a bigger boost than America Daan Struyven and Dan Milo of Goldman Sachs a bank compare the evolution of goods spending in real terms across 23 oecd countries America outperformed all but two The latest data from the oecd suggest that the Nordic countries also splurged On average though they spent about 5% more on goods in 2021 than pre-pandemic trends would have suggested compared with 10% in America The spending spree where it occurred helped lift economies out of recession But it also contributed to an inflation headache A deluge of new orders overwhelmed global supply chains which were already strained by pandemic-related disruptions leading to clogged ports and shipping delays With demand outstripping supply goods prices rose America Bureau of Labour Statistics reckons that goods prices boosted consumer-price inflation by 49 percentage points in the year to April 2022 having reduced it by 01 points in the 12 months before the pandemic Now spending is starting to shift in the other direction Data published on May 27th showed that spending on goods fell in the year to April and is now 9% above its pre-pandemic trend down from a high of 16% last year Spending on services is up by 7% in the same period and is just 3% below pre-pandemic trends But some services have been quicker to recover than others Messrs Struyven and Milo of Goldman Sachs note that while “fun” spending categories with pent-up demand such as food services air travel and hotels have rebounded over the past year others have lagged behind Services that cater to white-collar professionals have been slow to recover Spending on public transport is about 24% below where it would have been without the pandemic; laundry and dry-cleaning revenues meanwhile are 20% below trend Even some essential services have been slow to recover Spending on doctors’ and dentists’ services is about 15% below trend; child care is down by 22% Appetite for many non-essential goods by contrast shows little sign of abating Spending on jewellery and recreational vehicles is 53% and 43% above trend respectively Spending on pets is up by 23%One question is whether the composition of consumer spending will return to pre-pandemic norms The hope is that this eases bottlenecks and helps bring down inflation Yet several uncertainties lie ahead The process looks likely to be slow If recent trends in America continue goods and services spending will not return to pre-pandemic levels until perhaps the third quarter of next year And some habits could stick: the rise of remote working say may have permanently changed the consumption mix keeping the relative demand for goods higher than it was before the pandemic Hovering over all this is a potentially souring economic backdrop as people become gloomier about their finances Consumers especially those in America powered an extraordinary goods boom over the past couple of years What they do next is much less certain For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 26th 2022,Carbon markets are going global,Carbon markets for years short of puff have at last become one of the most widespread tools in the fight against climate change By the end of 2021 more than 21% of the world emissions were covered by some form of carbon pricing up from 15% in 2020 Ever more businesses have to pay regulators for the right to release a tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere Investors are getting interested too: trading on these markets grew by 164% last year to €760bn $897bnListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat is undoubtedly great news Carbon prices ensure companies that burn more fossil fuels are at a competitive disadvantage while green innovation is rewarded The revenue from the sale of carbon permits meanwhile can be reinvested in renewable energy or other virtuous ventures as governments see fitThe problem is that very few markets work as intended Of the 64 carbon taxes and emissions-trading systems etss that existed in 2021 only a tiny minority covering 38% of emissions priced the gas above $40 a tonne which the Carbon Price Leadership Coalition a group of businesses and governments estimates as the minimum social cost of carbon a measure of the damage done to global welfare by increasing emissions And that may be too generous already: some economists put it at more than $200 Many carbon markets are too cheap to make a differenceMost schemes operate on the principle of “cap and trade” Regulators set a total level of permitted annual emissionsthe capand auction these allowances to the companies included in the scheme Businesses can then trade the allowances between themselves putting a price on carbon dioxide Some etss also allow financial firms such as hedge funds to trade purely for profit on their own accountThe best markets put a high price on carbon thanks to a low cap that goes lower over time providing a strong incentive to go green They also cover a broad spectrum of economic activity allowing agents to trade off between burning petrol in cars coal in blast furnaces or natural gas in power plants The wide scope ensures that trading systems find the cheapest way of reducing emissions lowering the overall cost to society of fighting climate changeMany schemes however fall short on both counts The reason is obvious: a well-functioning ets demands political courage Like taxes carbon markets transfer resources from the private sector to the state which irks those standing for small government Higher carbon prices can also help to push up consumer prices angering voters while hurting the margins of firms that donate to political parties How ambitious carbon markets are is “an expression of political will” says Dallas Burtraw who chairs the independent committee overseeing California trading scheme All too often that will is missingChanging political winds have sometimes dealt a fatal blow to fledgling carbon markets Australia for example junked its own scheme in 2014 after the centre-right Liberal party made repealing the “carbon tax” a plank of its election campaign More often political heat leads governments to do all they can to keep prices low see chart On May 18th the European Commission pressed by member states worried about soaring energy prices said it would sell an extra 200m permits there are currently 145bn in circulation Carbon prices on the eu scheme the world second-biggest promptly fell from €90 $97 a tonne to around €80 Other schemes have been flooded with permits from the start China ets launched last year is the world biggest But with a price nearing 60 yuan $9 it does little to reduce emissions says Yan Qin of Refinitiv a data firmThe second problem is that swathes of the economy are often excluded Industrial firms argue that including them in a robust ets gives an unfair advantage to exporters from countries with a lower carbon price which is why the eu and others offer home-grown champions a certain amount of permits for free Although meant to prevent “carbon leakage” where steel firms say relocate from areas with strict emissions rules to those with looser standards such perks make schemes less effectiveConsumers too are often shielded from high carbon prices Transport and buildings where higher costs would be passed on to voters directly are excluded from the eu scheme Others do better: the Californian system the most comprehensive of the bigger etss covers 80% of the state emissions Proceeds from the sales of carbon permits are partly used to subsidise purchases of electric carsOther markets are even more limited in scope The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative rggi backed by 11 north-eastern American states only covers power generation So does China national system given the size of the Chinese economy it still covers 74% of global emissions Sometimes it is the way emissions are counted that is the problem China does not put a cap on the total amount of emissions which can still rise along with electricity demand but on the carbon intensity of power generation Its ets is also bedevilled by poor data collectionMaking carbon markets work better is more of a political challenge than an economic one Neither lowering caps on total emissions nor covering more sectors requires a deep rethink of carbon markets’ designs The difficulty rather is building and preserving support for measures that make most economic activities costlier The same applies to other climate-friendly measures notes Ben Caldecott of Oxford University: Britain has long failed to raise petrol taxes in line with inflation costing the government billions Cheeringly however the momentum around carbon markets looks self-sustaining The eu is considering what it calls a “carbon border-adjustment mechanism” which would see importers into the bloc pay the difference between the relevant foreign carbon price and the eu Not only would that remove the justification for free allowances for manufacturing firms inside Europe; it would also encourage countries that want to export to the bloc to bring their carbon prices closer to the euCreating bigger markets by linking two or more etss can also help plug carbon leaks That is of course justifiable on scientific grounds: a tonne of carbon is as harmful in one country as it is in any other It also makes carbon markets more liquid which helps form truer prices Accordingly regional patchworks have emerged California ets has been linked with Quebec since 2014 Switzerland ets merged with the eu in 2020 Pennsylvania will become the 12th state to join the rggi in July And although Britain chose to run a separate ets after leaving the eu rejoining the regional scheme should be rather painless As more of the world economy is covered by etss and carbon border taxes gain favour it will be laggards rather than early adopters that risk becoming uncompetitive That threat seems to be working After resisting for years Japan is set to try out a national carbon market in September Some American lawmakers are also starting to look again at carbon pricing if only because their country tends to be greener than many of its trade partners and carbon border taxes could be a handy excuse for protectionist measures The key to building support for decarbonisation says Mr Burtraw is to “create winners” In a country where China-bashing tends to be more popular than environmentalism it will do no harm to the cause if points can be scored at the expense of an arch-rival For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly

 May 26th 2022,The credit market hasn’t cracked yet,At their best capital markets hold up a mirror to the real economy They rise and fall in tandem with companies’ fortunes encouraging investors to direct money towards the firms most likely to make a return on it But the arrow of causality can also fly the other way A dysfunctional market can choke off the supply of capital even to healthy firms forcing them into default for no better reason than that financial conditions have tightenedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe worst instances of this occur when the credit market comes unstuck as it did in the financial crisis of 2007-09 That adds an ominous ring to the unusually sharp losses credit investors have endured recently Based on total returns American investment-grade bonds are down by 14% since September European ones have dropped by around 10% their worst peak-to-trough plunge The credit spread or premium paid by risky “high-yield” borrowers compared to Treasuries has spiked from three percentage points in late December to nearly five with around half that increase coming in May Firms from Carvana an American car retailer to Morrisons a British supermarket chain have struggled to issue debt Is it time to panic?To understand why not start with credit spreads Those for American high-yield bonds began 2022 close to all-time lows Even after their recent rise they remain below their long-run average and far from the levels seen in 2008 and during the covid convulsion in 2020 see chart Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics a consultancy says the tightening is more reminiscent of the growth scares of 2015-16 and 2018 than of a credit crunchA tsunami of corporate defaults remains unlikely Few of the riskiest borrowers have to repay their debt in the next 18 months Of America $15trn-worth of high-yield bonds just 45% falls due before 2024; the figure is 64% in the euro zone Most issuers need only worry about earning enough to meet their interest payments rather than finding new lenders to roll over their debt Moody a rating agency reckons the global default rate will hit 3% over the 12 months to April 2023higher than the 19% for the year to April 2022 but below the historical average of 41%Those firms that do need to refinance are likely to find a receptive market A monthly survey by America National Association of Credit Managers found financial conditions in April to be slightly tighter than in late 2021 but looser than at any time before that going back to 2004 As the Federal Reserve starts winding down its $58trn portfolio of Treasuries from June 1st some liquidity is likely to drain from the market For now however cases like Carvana and Morrisons look like outliersTwo risks remain One is that corporate profits disappoint so much that borrowers are unable to pay even their interest The bigger one is that risk-averse investors perhaps spooked by fears of a recession pull their money from bond funds en masse and hoard cash instead That would leave such funds with less to lend to new issuers Worse still they may be forced to fire-sell existing debt to fund redemptionsShould that happen the experiences of Carvana and Morrisons point to a safety valve Ultimately both firms managed to issue their debt by turning to private lenders and offering sweetened terms Between 2008 and 2021 the assets managed by such lenders tripled to $12trn Unlike traditional bond funds they don’t offer investors daily withdrawals meaning they are less susceptible to swings in sentiment and more able to deploy capital when the market is stressed They are sitting on more than $420bn of “dry powder” or unspent cash Daniel Lamy of JPMorgan Chase a bank does not expect them to hold fire for very much longer For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 25th 2022,How economic interdependence fosters alliances and democracy,On his whirlwind tour of Asia concluded on May 24th President Joe Biden conducted himself with the awkward urgency of a man trying to correct a costly error China may be reeling but the ambivalent reaction outside rich democracies to America late search for solidarity reveals how Washington global influence has faded relative to Beijing Mr Biden proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework unveiled on May 23rd seems an acknowledgment of why that is: for too long America had all but abandoned efforts to forge new economic ties in the regionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEstablishing a causal link between economic interdependence and the balance of geopolitical power is no simple matter however That economies often trade more with countries that share similar political values and interests is clear enough Yet it could be the case that strategic concerns tend to drive economic relationships not the other way around or that other shared featuressuch as income levels or culturebring countries closer in both economic and political terms Two recent papers help to pick apart what causes what A first by Benny Kleinman Ernest Liu and Stephen Redding of Princeton University considers whether economic interdependence fosters greater political alignment To answer the question the authors build a model in which countries sometimes take costly actions such as providing military aid to an ally in order to boost growth in countries with which they share political ideals and aims For those benevolent countries the incentive to be generous is partly rooted in the expectation that as the economy of the allied country grows they will receive an economic dividend Yet in the world the authors depict the reward is not fixed If a country economic fortunes become less entangled with some places and more with others then the relative pay-off from making costly political investments in those places changesand so over time will patterns of political friendship and enmity Economic interdependence in other words causes political rapprochement The authors reckon that China early liberalisation by driving a one-off surge in the country economic engagement with the world provides evidence for this proposition In assessing economic interdependence they focus on one measure: how productivity growth in one country affects real incomes in others Economic heft alone does not ensure that other places’ fortunes are bound up with your own Instead both rapid economic growth and extensive involvement in global supply chains can amplify a country economic influence on its trading partners Though initially modest China global economic influence had by the late 2000s overtaken America: the effect of Chinese growth on the incomes of its trading partners was larger than that of Uncle Sam indeed nearly double it by 2010 From 1980 to 2010 the paper finds the more economically enmeshed a country became with China the more political alignment ensued as captured by patterns of un voting the forming of formal alliances and similar metrics The authors find further support for their model by looking at global trade shifts associated with collapsing air-freight costs Because shipping by sea must flow around continents whereas aircraft follow great-circle routes the falling cost of air freight in the three decades to 2010 had uneven effects on bilateral trade flows around the globe This variation offers another way to test how growth in economic interdependence leads to political alignmentand the test again is conclusive This would seem to back oft-aired concerns that China rise has not just redrawn the geopolitical map but also helped to erode democracy worldwide Yet here the news is encouraging New work by Giacomo Magistretti of the imf and Marco Tabellini of Harvard University also exploits falling air-transport costs to tease out the causal effect of trade on both attitudes towards democracy and the overall political orientation of a country They find that stronger economic ties indeed facilitate the transmission of political valuesbut only if said values are democraticThe effects are big People who grew up during periods when their home economy traded comparatively more with democracies appear to be much more drawn to open regimes than those who came of age under opposite circumstances The difference in attitudes is equivalent to that between the support reported by residents of Sweden a bunch of hardcore democrats and those of China who are more tentative Pro-democracy populations in turn translate into more open institutions An 80% rise in trade with democratic countries over a five-year period raises a country Polity score which measures how democratic a country governing institutions are on a scale from -10 to 10 by four points: the difference roughly between Russia and Britain Strikingly trade with autocracies seems to have no such effect Excluding America or China from the analysis does not alter the resultsBye AmericaWhy should trade with democracies work this way? The data do not permit firm conclusions But evidence suggests the spur to democratisation does not stem from faster economic growth or rising levels of education Neither does it result from increased migration Instead the authors’ favourite theory assumes that trade with democracies boosts a country “democratic capital”: it fosters an appreciation for the value of democracy which helps cement a social consensus in support of democratic institutions That seems plausible if perhaps a little vagueBoth trade and geopolitics will look different in the years ahead than they did during the post-war era of American hegemony and globalisation But economic ties are likely to retain their capacity to cultivate allies and shore up support for democracy If Mr Biden wishes to bolster America national security he might consider giving freer trade a chance Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to unleash more investment in intangible assets May 21stThe world needs a new economic motor Could India fit the bill?

 May 24th 2022,America new Asian economic pact: just don’t call it a trade deal,A mere three days after being sworn in as president in January 2017 Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership tpp a 12-country free-trade deal he had railed against on the campaign trail On May 23rd 488 days after his own swearing-in President Joe Biden tried to reverse some of the damage by unveiling a new pact the 13-country Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ipef That Mr Biden took so much longer to launch his Asian trade policy illustrates one basic truth: it is far easier to tear up agreements than it is to craft them anewListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInevitably one way to look at the ipef is by way of comparison to the tpp which lives on in reduced form absent America Some bits sound rather familiar One selling-point for the tpp was that it was a “21st-century trade agreement” complete with high standards for workers’ rights and e-commerce rules The ipef is also “a 21st-century economic arrangement” according to Jake Sullivan America national security adviser The original tpp members accounted for nearly 40% of global gdp roughly the same share as the current ipef partners Most crucially China is still excluded The ipef like the tpp is an attempt to build a trading structure in Asia that enshrines both America economic principles and its economic powerwelcomed by many in the region as a counterbalance to China heftThat however is where the similarities end Mr Trump success in winning support with his calls to stop countries “ripping off” America has made many in Washington leery of ambitious free-trade deals So rather than starting work on a pact that would require approval from Congress Mr Biden team has designed a framework that is more malleable and may avoid that political death-trap In announcing the launch Katherine Tai the United States Trade Representative ustr pledged to “keep Congress close” in shaping the ipefa far cry from putting it to a voteMalleability has a few big downsides It limits what America can offer A cut in tariff rates a plank of most free-trade deals is a non-starter because it would require congressional support America still vows to push for strong labour and environmental standards but unable to offer more access to its vast market it lacks a key bargaining chip The durability of the ipef is also in doubt Were Mr Trump to return to the Oval Office in 2024 he would not need three days to ditch the frameworkThe Biden administration has tried to make a virtue of these limits Rather than conceiving of the ipef as a conventional deal it has declared that the pact will rest on four pillars with trade promotion just one The other three goals are to make supply chains more resilient; to promote infrastructure investment and clean energy; and to form new rules on taxation and anti-corruption It is tempting to dismiss such a wide-ranging agenda as too vague to amount to anything But paradoxically a near-stumble at the launch of the framework illustrated that it could in theory have force to its contents: America had to tone down the language in its founding documents otherwise some in Asia would have balked at signing themMatthew Goodman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies a think-tank notes that the focus on topics such as digital trade competition policy and bribery makes for a good menu for the ipef “These are issues that are very much in the interest of our partners in the region” he says At the same time breadth poses a challenge Instead of just having the ustr as the lead negotiator as in normal trade talks the Commerce Department is in charge of the non-trade portfolio That risks turning it into a multi-headed beastFor now many in the region are most pleased by the symbolism The wounds from America tpp exit are still raw Since Mr Biden election victory allies have waited and waited for America to devise a new Asian trade strategy At last it has arrived even if it is more notable for its political constraints than its economic potential “We are just happy to have them at the table” says one Australian official For more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 22nd 2022,Foreign investors are fleeing China,Jing’an century a housing development with ponds and lush greenery in north Shanghai should have been bustling as workers put the finishing touches on flats Instead the area is silent A two-month lockdown of the city of 25m people has forced Yanlord the developer to halt construction on the site Homebuyers have been on edge for months as some of the country largest developers default on bonds and struggle to deliver homesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow Yanlord until recently deemed in decent shape is telling customers they will not receive their properties on time At least 20 housing developments across the city have announced similar delays Many other projects have been forced to stop selling units The lockdown has been so severe that roadblocks and police checkpoints have mushroomed Workers materials and sales agents have been unable to reach construction sites Meanwhile Yanlord pre-sales of homes have slumped to less than 20% of the level a year agoChina property crisis is not new But growing fears among foreign investors of a grand policy disaster are The combination of a nosediving housing market and Xi Jinping uncompromising zero-covid policy is just one recent conundrum that has led foreign fund managers to question whether China is losing its pragmatic approach to managing the economy Mr Xi insistence on using prolonged lockdowns to rid China of the Omicron variant and his backing for Russia war in Ukraine strike many investors as ideological Add in the timing of his crackdown on tech groups such as Alibaba an e-commerce company and on the leverage of property giants such as Evergrande and it is not hard to see why some of the world largest investment groups are questioning the quality of leadership in Beijing Many attribute this and other campaigns to preparations for this autumn Communist Party congress at which Mr Xi is expected to be granted another five years in office The events of 2022 could shape how global investors view China for years to comeIn little over a year Mr Xi policies have had a profoundand painfulimpact on global markets They have knocked $2trn from Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong and New York Chinese initial public offerings in these two cities have nearly ground to a halt this year China property firms have sold just $280m in high-yield dollar bonds so far in 2022 down from $156bn during the same period last year Within China the value of yuan-denominated financial assets held by foreigners fell by more than 1trn yuan $150bn in the first quarter of 2022 the biggest drop ever The Institute of International Finance iif a bankers’ group in Washington forecasts that $300bn in capital will flow out of the country this year up from $129bn in 2021 Onshore markets were one of the linchpins of China relations with the outside world The belief that they would continue to open up helped to maintain links with Western financiers hoping to strike it rich Even as relations between America and China soured during the Trump years a craving for onshore securities took hold of many of the world biggest financial groups As a trade war dampened global sentiment regulators in Beijing began expediting long-promised reforms eventually allowing foreign financial groups to wholly own their onshore businesses The policies were a clear sign that Beijing meant business And the West reciprocated In 2018 msci added Chinese shares to its flagship emerging-markets index Other index inclusions followed creating a flood of foreign capital into onshore Chinese securities Between the start of 2017 and a peak at the end of 2021 foreign financial exposure to yuan-denominated assets more than tripled to 108trn yuanThat elation has fizzled Many foreign investors simply grew too enthusiastic about China and chose to ignore the risks says Hugh Young of Aberdeen an asset manager But the market is waking up The view from many investors is that although China has never been more open to foreign capital it has also not been this ideologically inflexible in recent memory China support for Russia has fed concerns over its claim on Taiwan which it vows eventually to take back by any means necessary Geopolitical concerns such as this are part of a broad recalibration of the risks associated with China “Policy risk has increased markedly” says Neil Shearing of Capital Economics a research firm That has led investors to demand a higher risk premium on Chinese assetsSome leading investment groups are starting to air these views in public BlackRock a giant asset manager that has been expanding rapidly in China said on May 9th that it had shifted its six- to 12-month view of Chinese equities to “neutral” from “modest overweight” Julius Baer a private bank said in April that it was ending a five-year call that Chinese equities would eventually become a “core asset class”This shift has contributed to a foreign sell-off of onshore stocks and bonds The unpopularity of yuan-denominated bonds has also been driven by a weaker currency and higher interest rates in America The value of foreign-held equities in China fell by nearly 20% in the first three months of the year or by about 755bn yuan Much of the drop was due to a fall in stock valuations; the csi 300 a key index is down by more than 17% since January But foreign investors are also scaling back their exposure Total foreign equity holdings have ebbed by about 2% so far this year calculates Gavekal a research group As a share of China stockmarket they fell from about 43% at the end of 2021 to just below 4% in March An interest-rate cut by the central bank on May 20th did little to buoy sentiment Several portfolio managers expect outflows to continue until there is more clarity around economic policyThe gloomy mood has been painful for China small and diminishing cohort of liberal technocrats who are still promoting the idea of an open China that is at least mildly sensitive to the concerns of global investors For years regulators have used carefully timed reforms to reward loyal long-term investors As sentiment soured in April they succeeded in delivering long-awaited private-pension reforms in an attempt to woo asset managers It was a salve regulators had been holding on to in the expectation that sentiment would worsen early this year says one fund manager Many investors see 2022 as a bellwether year for the direction of policy The optimistic outlook is that this gloomy period of ideology policy missteps and slow growth is part of the preparation for the party congress in the autumn Once that passes pragmatists will have more control of policy Zero-covid will end Support for the economy and tech firms will returnThis camp includes many of the investment managers who have slogged it out in China for decades Global banks have been telling investors for 20 years that the Chinese market is a one-way bet Only a war over Taiwan or a hot conflict of that nature could upend that narrative says one foreign banker in ChinaThe pessimistic view is that Mr Xi is serious about the direction in which he has taken China over the past two years and that the future will be far more ideological s&p a rating agency warned on May 19th that policy shocks to education housing labour and social welfare could continue for years Global investors have been slow to grasp the significance of China policy changes says Nikolaj Schmidt of T Rowe Price an investment manager It is unlikely things will return to normal soonMr Xi zero-covid policy and the unrelenting lockdown of Shanghai have also raised concerns about China leadership Some investors worry that the country has turned its back on growth; that zero-covid could be a sign of a factional struggle in Beijing; or that it will eventually lead to one “When investors hear they’re getting dragged into politics that when they get nervous” says Sean Debow of Eurizon Capital Asia an asset managerOne probable outcome in the months ahead is a growing divergence between the investors outside China and those with large offices inside the country Many groups that have worked for decades to open up in China are continuing to hire staff Investors that have accessed the onshore market through Hong Kong by contrast may continue to reduce their exposure If anything investing in China will only become more divisive this year For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 19th 2022,Why crypto bruising comedown matters,It has been a vicious year for financial markets and more punishing still for crypto assets The market capitalisation of crypto has slumped to just $13trn from nearly $3trn in November On May 18th bitcoin traded at around $29000 a mere 40% of its all-time high in November; the price of ether another cryptocurrency has collapsed just as spectacularly Six months ago Coinbase an exchange and the leading crypto-industry stock was worth $79bn Now it is valued at just $14bn and the firm is “reassessing its headcount needs” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe sell-off comes as the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates Tech stocks high-yield bonds and other risky assets have also swooned But crypto bruising comedown is interesting for a deeper reason: it has exposed weaknesses in the plumbing of the system The problems lie with the market for stablecoins a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another currency often the dollar Added together all stablecoins the largest of which are tether and usd coin usdc are worth around $170bn These act as a bridge between conventional banks where people use dollars and the “on-blockchain” world where people use crypto The biggest such coins are also used by exchanges as a base for trading between cryptocurrenciesFrom May 9th terra then the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalisation began to unravel The implosion put pressure on tether which is meant to be pegged one-for-one with the dollar On May 12th its price dipped to 95 cents Some $91bn in tether has since been redeemed for cash The technology and the jargon associated with crypto may be newfangled but to students of financial history these events look familiar They resemble the confidence crises that precede bank runs Every stablecoin has a mechanism to maintain its peg The simplest and safest method is to hold a dollar in a bank account or in safe liquid assets like Treasury bills for every stablecoin token The token can be traded freely by buyers and sellers; when a seller wants to offload their stablecoin they either sell it on the open market or redeem it for its dollar value from the issuer who then destroys the token usdc and tether use versions of this methodOthers like terra are called “algorithmic stablecoins” because they use an automated process to support the peg Their main distinguishing feature however is in how they are backed Terra is backed by luna a cryptocurrency issued by Terraform Labs which also runs terra The idea was that holders of terra could always redeem it for one dollar worth of newly minted luna On May 5th when luna was trading at $85 a piece that meant a terra holder could redeem it for 00118 lunas If for some reason terra was trading at less than $1 arbitrageurs could swoop in buy a terra redeem it for luna and sell that for a profitThat system worked as long as luna had some market value But on May 9th the price of luna began to slide And that in turn put pressure on terra pegcausing a rush to redeem The supply of luna ballooned On May 10th 350m tokens existed By May 15th 65trn did As the price of luna collapsed terra also went into free fall Its price is now hovering at around 10 cents Luna is worthless Do Kwon the founder of Terraform has tried to resuscitate terra He has turned the blockchain off and on again “burned” tokens and attempted to split the blockchain But nothing has worked so far Terra implosion has had wider and more worrying repercussions: it has prompted flight from tether Those fleeing may have felt anxious about the lack of detail regarding tether backing The company once said it backed its tokens with “us dollars” a claim New York attorney-general said in 2021 was “a lie” Now the firm says its tokens are “backed 100% by Tether reserves” This appears to be some mix of cash Treasuries and corporate debt but the company has refused to disclose the details claiming that its asset mix is its “secret sauce” As with many past bank runs where depositors fled to safety holders have sold off terra and tether and rushed to tokens perceived to be of higher quality One example is usd coin which holds only cash or Treasuries and publishes regular audited reports to that effect Dai another stablecoin backed by crypto and managed by algorithms has managed to maintain its peg Still that other stablecoins have survived might be small comfort if tether does not If tether really is backed by illiquid assets or perhaps assets that have fallen in value this year then the more some holders redeem its tokens the less remains in the pot for others The implosion of the world biggest and oldest stablecoin would be much more catastrophic than was terra Tether is not only a financial bridge between crypto and conventional moneyie dollars in bank accountsbut also between all kinds of crypto pairs that are traded on exchanges The three biggest and most liquid cryptocurrency pairs on Binance the biggest exchange for instance are bitcoin and tether; ether and tether; and Binance own stablecoin busd and tetherTether redeems only its big users who are pulling $100000 or more from it at a time and even then at its discretion Nonetheless redemptions have continued apace over the past week The loss of the peg on May 12th was a reflection of the stinginess of that system Smaller holders who wanted out had to sell the token on the open market The stablecoin has not fully recovered its peg For a year it traded at or above $1; since May 12th it has traded slightly below it Crypto most important bit of plumbing is still leaking For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 19th 2022,India once-vaunted statistical infrastructure is crumbling,The modern Indian state has a proud statistical heritage Soon after the country gained independence in 1947 the government resolved to achieve its development through comprehensive five-year plans The strategy though economically inadvisable nonetheless required the creation of a robust data-gathering apparatus In 1950 PC Mahalanobis the leading light of Indian statistics designed the National Sample Survey which sent staff to the far corners of the vast country to jot down data regarding its mostly illiterate citizens The survey complexity and scope seemed “beyond the bounds of possibility” reckoned one American statistician Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOf late however admiration has been replaced by alarm India statistical services are in a bad way Across some measures figures are simply not gathered; for others the data are often dodgy unrepresentative untimely or just wrong The country tracking of covid-19 provides a grim example As the pandemic raged across India officials struggled to keep tabs on its toll Officially covid has claimed more than half a million lives in India; The Economist excess-deaths tracker puts the figure far higher between 2m and 94m India government has also hampered efforts to assess the pandemic global impact refusing at first to share data with the World Health Organisation who and criticising its methods The preference for flattering but flawed figures is pervasive In education state governments regularly ignore data showing that Indian children are performing woefully in school and instead cite their own administrative numbers which are often wrong In Madhya Pradesh a state in central India an official assessment showed that all pupils had scored more than 60% in a maths test; an independent assessment revealed that none of them had Similarly in sanitation the central government says that India is now free of open defecation meaning that people both have access to a toilet and consistently use it Anyone who takes a train out of Delhi at dawn and looks out of the window however might question the claim When it comes to poverty arguably India biggest problem timely figures are not available Official estimates are based on a poverty line derived from consumption data in 2011-12 despite the fact that more recent but as yet unpublished numbers exist for 2017-18 By contrast Indonesia calculates its poverty rate twice a year India government explains its approach by pointing to discrepancies between recently gathered data and national accounts statisticsbut many suspect the true reason is that newer data would probably show an increase in povertyIn some cases flawed data seem more a problem of methodology than malign intent India gdp estimates for instance have been mired in controversy ever since the statistics ministry introduced a new series in 2015 a change that was in the works before the current government entered office Arvind Subramanian a former government adviser calculated that the new methodology overestimated average annual growth by as much as three to four percentage points between 2011-12 and 2016-17 Although current advisers insist that the official methodology is in line with global standards other studies have also found problems with the calculations The erosion of India statistical infrastructure predates the current government but seems to have grown worse in recent years Narendra Modi the prime minister has previously bristled at technocratic expertise and number-crunching “Hard work is more powerful than Harvard” he said in 2017 India data woes are also troubling for what they suggest about the ability of the state to provide the essential public services needed to foster long-run growth The statistics ministry short of staff and resources is emblematic of the civil service Data-gathering has become excessively centralised and over-politicised A National Statistical Commission was set up in 2005 and tasked with fixing India data infrastructure But its work has been complicated by turf wars and internal politics;

It has been bandied around quite freely in recent years applied not just to the usual suspects such as Russian or Iranian assets fenced off by financial sanctions but also to less obvious candidates Jim Cramer of cnbc a tv channel described oil stocks as uninvestible in January 2020 calling them the new tobacco Not so long ago the same was said about big banks and the whole of southern EuropeThe odd thing is that the word has become more common even as the world has become more investible Thanks to financial innovation and globalisation far-flung assets are far easier to buy than they used to be Back in 1988 msci emerging-markets equity index included only ten countries with a combined market capitalisation of just over $50bn The index now includes 24 countries with a market value of $69trn At the end of last year the value of global investible assets reached a record high of $179trn according to State Street an asset manager That is equivalent to 186% of world gdp in 2021 up from 116% in 2000Even in his unedited report Mr Yao did not argue that it was impossible to hold Chinese internet stocks Indeed he advised global investors to remain “neutral” on 11 of them So what was on his mind? He worried that the depositary receipts of some internet firms might be delisted from American exchanges because China has been reluctant to open the books of its auditors to American regulators This in itself would not make them uninvestible because the shares of most of these companies can also be bought in Hong Kong as Mr Yao himself pointed out But he saw this regulatory row as the latest manifestation of the geopolitical risks faced by China which became more salient after Russia invaded Ukraine Because of these risks he said global investors were likely to shun Chinese internet firms over the next 6 to 12 months however cheap they became During this “stage” he argued these stocks could no longer be valued by simply projecting their earnings and cashflow Only after foreign investors had departed would his “valuation frameworks” regain relevance presumably because the remaining investors locals and China specialists would be less sensitive to Sino-American relations He recommended revisiting the sector only when this new stage arrivedWhen would that be? The answer he admitted depended on “many unpredictable factors outside our forecast capability” It turns out he was right In a more upbeat report on May 16th he said that the second stage had already arrived well ahead of schedule Thanks to some encouraging noises on the delisting dispute Mr Yao believes that geopolitical risks have receded enough to give his valuation framework some purchase once again He duly offered new higher price targets for 18 companies His editors were then right that “uninvestible” was the wrong word “Unanalysable” would have been better if even uglier It is not that Chinese internet stocks could not be bought merely that they could not be valued using Mr Yao preferred framework which could not accommodate geopolitical risk Unfortunately few assets these days are entirely free of such risks Anyone taking a view on commodity prices and thus on inflation and therefore interest rates is also taking a view on war and peace If more investible assets are not to become unanalysable stockpickers may have to invest in a broader view of the world Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why Italy borrowing costs are surging once again May 14thWho wins from carnage in the credit markets?

 May 19th 2022,How to unleash more investment in intangible assets,When russia invaded Ukraine tangible things at first seemed all too important Bombs and bullets were what mattered; commodity markets were roiled; supply chains were upturned As the war has gone on however intangible factors have asserted their importance too The managerial and logistical know-how of the armed forces on either side as well as technological advantages like Ukraine deployment of Bayraktar drones have altered the course of the war So too has the goodwill that Ukraine has attracted from people around the world which has in turn led foreign governments to lend the country more support Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea that intangible assets though hard to see and measure are critically important to foster is the main message of a new book by Jonathan Haskel a Bank of England policymaker and Stian Westlake of Britain Royal Statistical Society “Restarting the Future” is their second book The first “Capitalism Without Capital” published in 2017 argued that the economics of intangible assets helped explain stagnating economic growth and rising inequality The new book goes a step further asking how the bottlenecks holding investment in intangibles back might be loosenedthereby fostering a more efficient and faster-growing economy Their work is part of a wave of writing on the future pace of growth which includes Dietrich Vollrath “Fully Grown” and Robert Gordon “The Rise and Fall of American Growth” Intangible investment includes the research and development conducted by firms as well as things like marketing design and branding In the late 1990s by some measures spending on intangibles in America overtook investment in tangible plant and equipment But the pace of spending has slowed since the financial crisis The authors note that annual growth in intangible capital in rich countries tended to be around 3-7% between 1995 and 2008 Over the subsequent decade however it barely surpassed 3% in any single year That did not just reflect slower economic growth Intangible investment also stopped rising as a share of gdp which poses something of a conundrum considering that corporate profits were strong Although the burst of overall investment in the past year or so has been impressive cross-country data on intangibles are not yet available Nor is it clear that the investment surge has done enough to alter the sluggish trendThe nub of the problem say Messrs Haskel and Westlake is that the economic and financial arrangements that exist to support investment are geared towards spending on capital goods not intangibles They point out that bursts of economic growth such as those in medieval Italian city states and in China between the 10th and 13th centuries have often faded precisely because institutions failed to generate the right incentives and activity Part of the solution this time say the authors is to encourage the financing of investment in intangibles A study by the oecd which looks at 29 developed economies from 1995 to 2015 suggests that intangible-heavy sectors are more productive in places with more developed financial systems where they can access finance more easily Differences in financial development as measured by a combination of equity-market capitalisation and total credit to gdp can explain why annual labour-productivity growth in a sector like computer equipment where two-thirds of assets are intangible has been a percentage point higher in more financially developed countries like Japan than in places like PortugalVenture capital vc has been a preferred source of equity funding for firms conducting the most intangible activity such as biotechnology and consumer-tech But that has been disproportionately available to American companies with a plan for extremely rapid growth In many parts of the world a lot of business investment is still debt-financed and more dependent on the use of physical assets as collateral America vc industry took off after pension funds were allowed to invest in less liquid investments in 1979 That may help explain why business investment in America has held up better than in many other places The authors therefore advocate for larger investment vehicles that pool risk for individual lenders elsewhere in the world like the Long-Term Asset Fund launched in Britain last year which helps pension funds gain exposure to long-term illiquid assets Ending the tax advantages of debt financing by removing the tax deductibility of interest payments say would help level the playing-field between tangible and intangible investment Other prescriptions relate to how and where investment occurs Patent law for instance should not prevent the combination of existing ideas More important still is the role of cities which the authors note are cauldrons of intangible investment: they make it easier to form the relationships that make intangibles happen encourage new ideas and create a larger pool of beneficiaries when investments spill over Making cities work therefore with better land-use and zoning policies is vitalCan’t touch this “Restarting the Future” may be emblematic of a shift in economists’ thinking on growth In the 2010s debates raged over how best to address persistent shortfalls in demand In the inflationary-looking 2020s the emphasis is on unleashing the economy supply potential But where researchers such as Mr Gordon and Mr Vollrath regarded the bursts of rapid growth in the 20th century as the exception not the rule Messrs Haskel and Westlake are more hopeful of a return to headier rates of growth Mr Gordon argued that the digital economy was a busted flush when it came to growth; Mr Vollrath saw slower growth as a symptom of economic success a larger services sector and reduced geographic mobility By presenting solutions “Restarting the Future” offers a more optimistic visionas long that is as governments follow its advice Read more from Free Exchange our column on

 May 19th 2022,Offset markets struggle in the face of surging commodity prices,The loamy soil and dense jungle of the Sumatran rainforest in Indonesia can store an average of 282 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare If a group of climate-conscious airline passengers were to find a hectare of such forest at risk of being cut down for palm oil and were able to stop that happening they would offset the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by 175 passengers flying economy class from London to New York and backListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDemand for such carbon offsets is forecast to rocket over the next couple of decades as businesses attempt to make good on their promises to reach net zero carbon emissions Last year an estimated $1bn was spent on offsets McKinsey a consultancy predicts that the size of the market could expand by a factor of 15 by 2030 and 100 by 2050 Although a few projects use novel technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the air altogether and store it underground most offsets promise to subsidise renewables or pay for carbon sinks such as forests to be restored or preserved Such “nature-based” offsets can include protecting wetlands in Colombia or restoring peatland in ScotlandBut the market is not working The price of a carbon offset is far too low The opportunity cost of leaving land uncultivated is rising A hectare of Sumatran rainforest for instance could produce around 25 tonnes of palm oil a year and palm-oil prices have risen to $1520 a tonne from around $1000 a year ago But the price of nature-based offsets has fallen this year to $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide according to contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Deforestation remains economically rational Because a palm-oil plantation still captures around 170 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare leaving the land uncultivated offsets only 112 tonnes An offset price of $10 means that if the accounting is done properly selling offsets yields revenue of only $1120not enough to compensate for the potential loss of about $3800 in annual sales of palm oil At current prices says Ariel Perez of Hartree Partners a trading firm the only agricultural activity that is less profitable than preserving forests is harvesting rubber in West Africa For as long as the price of an offset remains below $20 cattle farming in the Amazon will remain attractive Why has the price of offsets fallen? Some cap-and-trade schemes in which companies must buy permits for their emissions allow for a certain amount of emissions to be offset By and large however offsets are not required by regulation Firms and individuals seeking to reduce their carbon footprints choose to buy them meaning that the demand for offsets is largely driven by ethical or public-relations imperatives As the war in Ukraine began and attention turned away from climate change offset prices declined Another problem is that there are few internationally agreed rules for offsets A report published earlier this month by Carbon Direct a consultancy said that “the voluntary carbon market largely consists of projects of questionable quality” A surplus of older and less reliable offsets hangs over the market depressing prices It is not possible to truly know what would have happened had an offset not been paid for “Most projects over-report and some don’t reduce emissions at all” says Barbara Haya of the University of California Berkeley “It really hard for people to know what is real and what isn’t”Some attempts are being made to bring clarity Proposals from the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets an independent committee are expected later this year They are likely to emphasise the need for “additionality” meaning that the reduction in emissions claimed must be a direct result of the offset Paying for green-energy installation for instance would not count as a genuine offset if the project were viable without the offset payment Nor would a forest that was never going to be cut down in the first place Checking that offsets meet the criterion though will remain a daunting task For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 May 19th 2022,Even China official economic figures look bleak,When china was locked down during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 economic forecasters had to make two predictions: how much would the economy suffer? And how much of this suffering would the official statistics be allowed to reflect? When China reported a historic 135% decline in industrial production in January and February 2020 compared with a year earlier it surprised many forecasters not because it diverged from their bleak view of the economy but because it challenged their cynical view of the statisticiansListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow that China is squirming under its most stringent lockdowns since early 2020 the same conundrum has returned How bad will the economy get? And how faithful will the data be? An early answer to both questions arrived this week The data were worse than expected and therefore worthier than feared On May 16th China reported that industrial production fell by 29% in April compared with a year earlier Compared with the previous month it fell by over 7% according to the National Bureau of Statistics The number was the most consequential surprise since the spring of 2020 according to a measure by Goldman Sachs which considers both the scale of the forecast error and the significance of the indicator Retail sales fell by 14% compared with a year earlier once adjusted for inflation Catering fell by more than 22% and car sales by over 30% in nominal terms In locked-down Shanghai sales of cars were “about zero” according to the Shanghai Automobile Sales AssociationSome of the most spectacular declines were in the all-important property sector Sales of new homes fell by 42% and housing starts by over 44% Even China unemployment figures long mocked for their uncanny stability were morbidly interesting In 2018 China rolled out a new unemployment survey in its cities This superseded an older spectacularly uninformative measure which counted the number of people who qualified for and were able to claim unemployment benefits The new survey showed unemployment rising to 61% in April still a little below its peak of 62% in February 2020 But in 31 big cities unemployment is now 67% whereas it reached only 57% in 2020 This suggests that Omicronor the policy response to ithas hurt China larger cities disproportionately The pattern of economic pain is different this time It remains to be seen whether these grimly realistic monthly indicators will translate into a similarly unflattering official gdp figure for the second quarter When the pandemic first struck China had yet to commit itself to an official growth target for the year That perhaps gave it more leeway to report a big drop in first-quarter gdp This year by contrast China leaders have already set a target of around 55% and promised as recently as April 29th to try to meet their economic goals It is just not clear how On May 15th China authorities said the floor on mortgage rates would be cut for first-time buyers But that will make little difference if people cannot go out to view properties The government has also placed great emphasis on infrastructure investment But this increased by only 43% in nominal terms in April compared with a year earlierfar short of the 18% pace that Natixis a bank thinks it needs to reach if China is to grow anywhere near 5% this yearUntil the authorities relax their covid controls their efforts to revive growth are likely to be ineffective They must therefore be hoping that Omicron recedes fast enough to allow growth to catch up later in the year Alternatively if China cannot bring itself to abandon its growth target it may have to fiddle its gdp figures That would be a pity Many of China economic indicators may be shrinking dramatically But their credibility edged up this week For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 17th 2022,A baby-formula shortage feeds criticism of corporate heft and price gouging,Shoppers have become all too familiar with the fragility of supply chains In America the latest product missing from supermarket shelves is infant formula Whereas previous shortages affecting everything from cars to couches presented an inconvenience a lack of nourishment for babies creates serious health risks So the administration has swung into action On May 16th the Food and Drug Administration fda said America would loosen restrictions on imports of formula Two days later President Joe Biden invoked the Defence Production Act to boost domestic production Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThere are several explanations for the shortage The biggest problem has been a halt to production at a facility in Michigan since February when officials began investigating infections in four babies possibly caused by its milk-based powder A lack of packaging delays to the import of ingredients and staffing vacancies have also contributed to the headache As much as 43% of formula products were out of stock across America in early May according to Datasembly a data firm Some politicians and analysts have also pointed to two deeper problems in the American economy supposedly exposed by the shortages: corporate concentration and price gouging The former is a valid concern; the latter is a distractionJust four companies Abbott Gerber Perrigo and Reckitt Benckiser make nearly all of America formula The production stoppage occurred at a factory owned by Abbott which controls around 40% of the market It is an illustration of how reduced competition seen in about three-quarters of American industries over the past 30 years can serve the economy poorly Concentration in the formula market has been exacerbated by regulation About 98% of formula consumed in America is made domestically because of the fda stringent approval process for foreign factories And more than half is purchased through a nutrition programme for low-income families which in turn buys from a single supplier in each state In 2007 when California switched its contract from Abbott to Mead Johnson now owned by Reckitt Abbott market share there fell from 90% to 5% while Mead rose from 5% to 95% On May 13th a group of Democratic senators called for an antitrust review of the industry If that were to happen it would not solve the shortages at hand but it could put the market on sounder footingMore dubious are claims about the severity of price gouging Mr Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether “unscrupulous profiteers” were scooping up formula in shops and reselling it for hugely marked-up prices And there have indeed been instances of such anti-social behaviourBut for some in the Democratic Party these allegations about pricing now fit into a broader narrative that corporate greed lies at the root of high inflation Elizabeth Warren a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and several colleagues introduced a bill on May 12th that would “prohibitprice gouging during all abnormal market disruptions” They cited a study by the Economic Policy Institute a left-wing think-tank which argued that fatter profit margins have driven more than half of price rises since 2020 Mr Biden has also seized on greed as an explanation for high prices On May 13th he tweeted that making the wealthiest companies pay “their fair share” would bring down inflationIn theory the fiscal drag that would come from higher taxes without any offsetting increase in government spending could reduce inflation as well as growth But if corporate greed explains high inflation why did so many prices only start to soar well after the pandemic began? It is not as if companies just discovered a love of profits Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon was right to criticise Mr Biden tweet as “misdirection” accusing him of trying to muddy the water in the debate over prices Indeed something far more basic explains the run-up in inflation: a surge in stimulus-fuelled demand compounded by disruptions to supply For individual products the signal sent by higher prices is the most effective way to bring supply and demand back into balance In the case of baby formula it encourages domestic companies to make more and foreign producers to run the gauntlet of approvals Much like formula itself higher prices can play a part in healthy development For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

It is the world sixth-largest economyas China was in 2000 And its output today stands broadly where China stood two decades ago China went on to manage an average annual growth rate of about 9% India grew by just under 7% per year over the same period It might easily have done better though were it not for policy mistakessuch as Prime Minister Narendra Modi shock decision to withdraw some banknotes in 2016and macroeconomic vulnerabilities including an overextended financial sector The government may have learnt from the first; both policymakers and the banks have worked to address the second Before the war in Ukraine the IMF had reckoned that India might grow by 9% this year Some optimists argue that in the right circumstances India could manage such rates on a sustained basisA closer look however suggests that India is not a substitute for China One problem is that the world economy is much larger than it used to be such that a given rise in India GDP raises global growth by less Sustained annual growth of 9% would vastly improve the lives of Indians and meaningfully tilt the balance of global economic and political power But it would not mean that the world economy would revolve around India as it did around China over the past two decades India contribution to global growth would remain smaller than that of America and Europe combined for examplePerhaps more important global economic conditions may be considerably more forbidding than those that enabled China rise From 1995 to 2008 the value of world trade rose from 17% of global GDP to 25% The share of goods exports participating in global value chains rose from about 44% of world exports to 52% China was at the forefront of both trends It was the most dominant trading country since imperial Britain according to an analysis of “hyperglobalisation” published in 2013 by Arvind Subramanian of Brown University and Martin Kessler of the OECD a rich-country think-tankIndia by contrast is a trade minnow On the eve of the pandemic it accounted for less than 2% of global merchandise exports It hopes to raise that share by investing in infrastructure providing public subsidies to manufacturers and negotiating trade deals with uncharacteristic enthusiasm But times have changed World trade has fallen as a share of global GDP since the early 2010s Economic nationalism could stymie a recovery India may nonetheless hope to increase its exports by capturing market share from other economiesincluding China But businesses and governments that were once willing to rely heavily on China in the name of efficiency have become more cautious Their reluctance to become too dependent on any one source of supply could check India ambitionsDominating global supply chains may not be the only route to economic influence India is a precocious exporter of tech and business services; though its GDP is only one-sixth that of China its services exports only just lag behind the latter Research published in 2020 by Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva and Rikard Forslid of Stockholm University argues that technological change is expanding the range of exportable services and providing more opportunities for workers in poor countries to compete with services workers in the rich world But while tech and business services may continue to thrive in India their expansion may be limited by an inadequate system of education which performs well on measures of enrolment but not of learning outcomes and by the protected nature of rich-world service sectors which may be better insulated against foreign competition than were industrial workers against Chinese importsSubcontinental surgeEven if India manages a growth rate of nearer 6% than 9% that would be nothing to sneeze at It would make India the world third-largest economy by the mid-2030s at which point it would contribute more to global GDP each year than Britain Germany and Japan combined Indian demand for resources would then drive commodity prices; its capital markets would tantalise foreign investors A large English-speaking population and a democratic political system if India can keep it may allow Indian tech and cultural exports to wield more global influence than did China at similar income levelsBut the world by then will have recognised if it has not already that the rise of China was a unique event Indian growth will be world-changing But you should neither hope for nor fear a reprise of the Chinese experience Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why long-term economic growth often disappoints May 7thHow would an energy embargo affect Germany economy?

 May 14th 2022,Even outside America inflation is starting to look entrenched,INFLATION DOMINATES the American popular psyche to an extent not seen since the 1980s when prices were last rising at the current pace Much like complaining about the weather or last night basketball play-offs moaning about higher prices has become a conversation starter According to figures published on May 11th consumer prices rose by 83% in April compared with the previous year A day earlier President Joe Biden called fighting inflation his “top domestic priority” Newspapers are publishing four times as many stories mentioning inflation as they did a year ago; several polls suggest that Americans believe inflation is a bigger problem for their country than the war in Ukraine But America is not alone Inflation is also becoming baked into everyday life in other parts of the rich worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Economist has gathered data on five indicators across ten big economies”core” inflation which excludes food and energy prices; the dispersion in inflation rates for the sub-components of the consumer-price index; labour costs; inflation expectations; and Google searches for inflation To gauge where inflation has become most pervasive we rank each country according to how it fares on each measure and then combine these ranks to form an “inflation entrenchment” scoreContinental Europe so far at least seems to have escaped the worst of the scourge Inflation is leaving barely a trace on Japan But it is entwining itself around Anglophone economies Canada is faring slightly worse even than America Britain has a big problem on its hands see chartA few factors explain the differences Total fiscal stimulus across Anglophone countries in 2020-21 was about 40% more generous than in other rich places according to our estimates It was also more focused on handouts to households such as stimulus cheques That may have further stoked demand Monetary policy in the euro area and Japan was already ultra-loose before the pandemic limiting the amount of extra stimulus central banks could provide Britain inflation may also reflect an idiosyncratic factor: Brexit It turns out that breaking with your largest trading partner causes costs to riseThe simplest component of our ranking is the rate of core inflation This measure gives a better sense of underlying price pressure Among our ten countries America leads the pack though core inflation is above average pretty much everywhereA second measure of dispersion helps capture how broadly based price pressures are Headline inflation being driven by one or two itemssay the cost of a restaurant mealis less worrisome than if the price of everything is going up quickly We divide a country consumer-goods basket into as many as 16 components then calculate the share where the inflation rate exceeds 2% In Japan just a quarter cross that threshold But in Australia more than two-thirds do JPMorgan Chase a bank breaks down Britain consumer-price index into 85 components and finds that inflation rates for 69% of them are running above their 1997-2019 averagesInflation could also spiral if workers demand higher wages to compensate them for rising prices and firms raise their prices in turn Unit labour costs which measure the relationship between what workers are paid and the value of what they produce are rising far faster than their long-run average in many countries On May 5th America statisticians revealed that these rose by 7% in the first quarter compared with a year ago up from a pre-pandemic average of around 2% Michael Saunders of the Bank of England has noted that with pay deals being struck at up to 5% a year but productivity growth of only around 1% Britain unit-labour-cost growth is probably “well above the pace consistent with the inflation target [of 2%]”Our last two measures assess households’ expectations The higher these remain the more likely it is that inflation becomes embedded One proprietary data set provided to The Economist by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a rare reliable cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations In May 2021 a respondent in the median rich country thought inflation over the next 12 months would be 23% Now they expect a rate of 45%; Canadians an even higher 6% A measure of Google searches also suggests the subject is weighing on people minds Britons now search more frequently for “inflation” than they do for Taylor Swift For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 14th 2022,Digital payments have gone viral in Brazil,FOR YEARS Brazilians had little incentive to abandon cash Wiring 50 reais $10 to a friend would set you back an extra 16; swiping a credit card 2% of the cost of your purchase For e-commerce firms this made doing business particularly cumbersome Customers wanting to buy something online but not wanting to incur the costs of a digital payment could choose instead to print a payment slip boleto take that slip to a shop or post office and hand over the cash The problem for e-commerce firms however was that not everyone who printed a boleto ended up going to a shop to fork over the cashmeaning that many transactions were never completedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThen came Pix an instant-payments system operated by the central bank Launched in November 2020 it has transformed the way Brazilians make payments The platform allows consumers and merchants to send and receive money via a QR code without having to share details of their wallet fintech provider or bank In April around 118m people used the platformor more than two-thirds of Brazilian adults In the last quarter of 2021 they made a staggering 39bn payments Already Pix has surpassed debit and credit cards as the most popular method of payment in Brazil One in five transactions now takes place on the platform mobile appAs an idea Pix is not new or unique India Unified Payments Interface UPI began life in 2016 Other countries have established similar schemes Nonetheless Pix has been a remarkable success For years the central bank sought to make Brazil financial system more competitive digital and inclusive Pix has helped achieve those aims Its rapid adoption could also contain lessons for othersSeveral factors explain why Pix has been so popular For a start it is easy to use Setting up an account takes a matter of minutes A user identifying “key” can be a CPF a sort of tax ID a phone number or a randomly generated string of digits Sending money to recipients at another bank is quick and painlessPolicymakers also acted to encourage adoption Unlike its Mexican counterpart whose Pix equivalent has been less successful Brazil central bank compelled big banks and fintech firms to join its platform During the covid-19 pandemic it mandated that emergency payments made by the government should also be available through the app In this way up to 30m unbanked Brazilians received a cashless payment for the first timeMost payments are of small value and take place between individuals The ubiquity of Pix is such that beggars often ask for money with a QR code These transactions are possible because they are so cheap Pix is free to use for individuals and is by far the lowest-cost option for firmsThe introduction of Pix has had a mixed effect on the country banks Current-account service fees charged by Brazil five biggest lenders were almost 27bn reais lower in 2021 than the year before But banks insist that Pix also presents them with opportunities For one thing as society goes cashless they are spending less on transporting lorryloads of banknotes And although it is not necessary to have a bank account to use Pix the platform seems to encourage people to open one According to Mastercard a credit-card giant Brazil reduced its unbanked population by as much as 73% during the pandemic There are now more potential customers to sell credit products to says Julio Paixão of Bradesco one of the big five banksOne of the biggest surprises is that despite the astronomical success of Pix the number of credit-card transactions has continued to grow Pix is not just serving as a substitute for other cashless payment methods but increasing themThere have been some unforeseen problems Since Pix has been introduced the number of “lightning kidnappings” has surged as criminals forced users to transfer large sums of money In response Pix has introduced a night-time limit on transactions Staff at the central bank have been on strike on and off since early April raising concerns about the operability of the system Others worry about the possibility of a data breach though so far there do not seem to have been any By and large however shortcomings are being rapidly addressedThe central bank has plans for further expansion By the end of this year Pix should be available offline and further integrated into open banking a system that allows customers to share their transaction data with fintechs Soon there will be an option to pay for things in instalments And in the coming years there are plans to make the app available abroad which would facilitate remittances and other cross-border paymentsThe success of platforms such as Pix may have far-reaching implications Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements the central bank for central banks considers them “a huge leap” towards the adoption of central bank digital currencies CBDCs A retail CBDC requires a register of users and their real names and a full record of who pays what to whom and when he explains With Pix you have all that already as well as the technical standards that govern the exchange of information; it is 80% of the way to a CBDC he reckons Brazil central bankers who are working on a CBDC of their own seem inclined to agree The Pix revolution could be just the beginning For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 May 14th 2022,China extraordinary export boom comes to an end,LAST MONTH a yellow-striped freight train rumbled into Budapest carrying solar-power equipment air-conditioning kit and other bits and pieces It had travelled for 16 days all the way from Shandong a province in eastern China As part of China Belt and Road Initiative freight trains now serve more than 50 cities in Europe and Asia from Shandong They are called “Qilu” trains a nod to the ancient Qi and Lu kingdoms that flowered in that part of China in the Confucian eraListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina exports whether by rail road sea or air have made rapid progress in the past two years They rose by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 Over 5000 Qilu trains have left the station since 2018 But in April China export growth slowed to a desultory chug In dollar terms exports were only 39% higher than a year earlierEven that modest increase was something of a miracle It came despite China increasingly surreal battle against covid-19 which has locked down Shanghai one of the country biggest trade hubs and imposed onerous restrictions on mobility elsewhere According to Nomura a bank stringent limits remain in 41 cities accounting for almost 30% of GDP Towns have been so anxious to avoid outbreaks that officials have sealed lorry drivers into their cabs while they wait to pick up cargo at motorway checkpoints These kinds of precautions have also gummed up international trade In mid-April 506 vessels were waiting outside Shanghai port according to Windward a shipping-analytics firm compared with 260 in FebruaryOptimists had hoped that China export machine could weather occasional outbreaks of the Omicron variant Workers they pointed out could isolate themselves on the job living where they work in a so-called “closed loop” But no modern factory is entirely self-contained; every “closed” loop must remain open to its suppliers And if any loop in the supply chain succumbs to the virus it can disrupt production in all of them Tesla car production in Shanghai has for example been hampered by a shortage of wiring harnesses from a virus-hit supplier according to Reuters a news agencyTo increase trade by any amount in these conditions is impressive But the headline 39% expansion reported by China customs agency on May 9th was more nominal than real More detailed statistics published later in the month are likely to show that the price of China exports rose by perhaps 8% or more in April compared with a year earlier according to UBS a bank If so the volume of China exports must have shrunk last monthThese price increases have raised fears that a locked-down China will exacerbate inflation in its trading partners particularly America The alarm is often exaggerated Goods made in whole or in part in China made up less than 2% of American personal consumer spending in 2017 according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco China covid-related bottlenecks could have larger ripple effects say by allowing rival manufacturers to raise their prices Most American inflation however is made in AmericaIndeed China exports may be more a victim of America woes than a cause of them America slowdown is contributing to weaker demand for China goods on top of self-inflicted disruptions to their supply Surveys of purchasing managers have revealed falling export orders every month so far this year And China official statistics showed declining exports last month of the computers and household appliances that were in such high demand when the West too was locking itself downNot everything is slowing however China imports from Russia have continued to grow since Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine as sanctions have hindered Russia access to Western markets The offerings included 50 carriage-loads of barley carried to Shandong province on a Qilu train For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 14th 2022,Which housing markets are most exposed to the coming interest-rate storm?,STOCKS ARE sinking a cost-of-living crisis is in full swing and the spectre of global recession looms But you wouldn’t know it by looking at the rich world housing markets many of which continue to break records Homes in America and Britain are selling faster than ever House prices in Canada have soared by 26% since the start of the pandemic The average property in New Zealand could set you back more than NZ$1m $640000 an increase of nearly 46% since 2019Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor more than a decade homeowners benefited from ultra-low interest rates Now however changes are brewing On May 5th the Bank of England having forecast that inflation in Britain could exceed 10% later this year raised its policy rate for the fourth time to 1% The day before America Federal Reserve had increased its benchmark rate by half a percentage point and hinted that more tightening would follow Investors expect the federal funds rate to rise above 3% by early 2023 more than triple its current level Most other central banks in the rich world ranging from Canada to Australia have either started pressing the monetary brakes or are preparing to do soMany economists believe that a 2008-style global property crash is unlikely Households’ finances have strengthened since the financial crisis and lending standards are tighter Scarce housing supply together with robust demand high levels of net household wealth and strong labour markets should also support property prices But the rising cost of money could make homeowners’ existing debt burdens difficult to manage by increasing their repayments while putting off some prospective buyers If that hit to demand is big enough prices could start to fallHomeowners’ vulnerability to sharp rises in mortgage payments varies by country In Australia and New Zealand where prices jumped by more than 20% last year values have got so out of hand that they may be sensitive to even modest rises in interest rates In America and Britain where markets are a little less torrid interest rates may have to approach 4% for house prices to fall reckon analysts at Capital Economics a consultancyAlongside price levels three other factors will help determine whether the housing juggernaut simply slows or comes crashing to a halt: the extent to which homeowners have mortgages rather than own their properties outright; the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages instead of fixed-rate loans; and the amount of debt taken on by householdsConsider first the share of mortgage-holders in an economy The fewer homeowners who own their properties outright the greater the impact of a rate rise is likely to be Denmark Norway and Sweden have relatively high shares of mortgage-holders see table A relaxation of lending standards in response to the covid-19 pandemic turbocharged borrowing In Sweden tax breaks for homeowners have further fuelled the rush to secure mortgages while a dysfunctional rental market characterised by overpriced and illegal subletting has pushed more tenants into home ownership All this puts Nordic banks in a tricky position In Norway and Sweden housing loans make up more than a third of banks’ total assets In Denmark they account for nearly 50% of lenders’ books Sharp falls in house prices could trigger lossesHome and dryBy contrast with the Nordics where home ownership has been fuelled by the growth of mortgage markets many households in central and eastern European countries bought homes without taking on debt in the 1990s because property was so cheap In Lithuania and Romania more than four-fifths of households are outright owners Mortgage-free households are also more prevalent in southern Europe notably Spain and Italy where inheritance or family support is a common route to home ownership Germans for their part are more likely to rent than own their homes Rate rises will consequently have less direct impact on pricesThe structure of mortgage debtthe second factoralso matters Rising interest rates will be felt almost instantly by borrowers on variable rates which fluctuate with changes in policy rates; for those on fixed rates the pain will be delayed In America mortgage rates tend to be fixed for two or three decades In Canada nearly half of home loans have rates that are set for five or more years By contrast lending in Finland is almost entirely priced at floating rates In Australia around four-fifths of mortgages are tied to variable ratesJust looking at the proportion of borrowers on fixed versus variable rates can mislead however In some countries mortgage rates may often be fixed but for a period that is too short to protect borrowers from the interest-rate storm In New Zealand fixed-rate mortgages make up the bulk of existing loans but nearly three-fifths are fixed for less than a year In Britain nearly half the fixed-rate stock is for up to two yearsResilience to rising rates will also depend on the quantum of debt taken on by householdsour third factor High indebtedness came into sharp focus during the global financial crisis As property prices fell households with towering mortgage repayments relative to their incomes found themselves squeezed Today households are richerbut many are saddled with more debt than ever While Canadians added C$36trn $28trn to their combined pile of savings during the pandemic buoying their net wealth to a record C$159trn at the end of 2021 their ravenous appetite for homes has pushed household debt to 137% of income The share of new mortgages with extreme loan-to-income ratios ie exceeding 45 has also risen prompting Canada central bank to issue a warning about high levels of indebtedness in November last yearFinancial regulators in Europe are equally worried In February the European Systemic Risk Board warned of unsustainably high mortgage debt in Denmark Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway and Sweden In Australia homeowners’ average debt as a share of income has swollen to 150% In all these countries households will face heftier monthly repayments just as soaring food and energy costs eat into their incomesAll shapes and sizesBring this together and some housing markets seem set for more pain than others Property in America which bore the brunt of the fallout from the subprime-lending crisis appears better insulated than many large economies Borrowers and lenders there have become more cautious since 2009 and fixed rates are much more popular Housing markets in Britain and France will fare better in the short term but look exposed if rates rise further Property in Germany and southern and eastern Europe appears less vulnerable By contrast prices may be most sensitive to rate rises in Australia and New Zealand Canada and the NordicsOne floor for house prices is that in most countries demand still vastly outstrips supply Strong job markets hordes of millennials nearing home-buying years and a shift to remote working have all increased the demand for more living space New properties remain scarce which will sustain competition for homes and help keep prices high In Britain there were 36% fewer property listings in February compared with the start of 2020; in America there were 62% fewer listings in March than the year beforeNor does the alternative to owning a homerentinglook particularly attractive Across Britain average rents were 15% higher in April than in early 2020 In America they rose by a fifth in 2021 with bigger rises in hotspots such as Miami where they jumped by almost half Rent controls cause a different sort of pain Prospective tenants of such properties in Stockholm face an average waiting time of nine yearsAs the era of ultra-cheap money comes to an end then demand for housing is not about to collapse Yet one way or another renters and homeowners will face an intensifying squeeze Correction May 23rd: An error in the table has been corrected The second column shows the share of households with a mortgage not the share of homeowners with a mortgage SorryFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 13th 2022,Russia is on track for a record trade surplus,WITHIN DAYS of Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine Russia financial system seemed on the verge of collapse The West imposed a range of financial sanctions notably on the Russian central bank foreign-exchange reserves that sent the rouble plunging and led citizens to withdraw cash frantically Then the central bank raised interest rates imposed capital controls and injected liquidity into the banking system and some of these misfortunes reversed Although a chunk of Russia currency reserves remains frozen the country still generates about $1bn a day from its energy exportsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia has stopped publishing detailed monthly trade statistics But figures from its trading partners can be used to work out what is going on They suggest that as imports slide and exports hold up Russia is running a record trade surplusOn May 9th China reported that its goods exports to Russia fell by over a quarter in April compared with a year earlier while its imports from Russia rose by more than 56% Germany reported a 62% monthly drop in exports to Russia in March and its imports fell by 3% Adding up such flows across eight of Russia biggest trading partners we estimate that Russian imports have fallen by about 44% since the invasion of Ukraine while its exports have risen by roughly 8%Imports have collapsed partly because sanctions on the Russian central bank and the expulsion of some lenders from the SWIFT interbank messaging network have made it harder for consumers and firms to buy Western goods Elina Ribakova of the Institute of International Finance IIF a bankers’ group says that regulatory uncertainty was also a big factor at first as Western firms were unsure which Russian banks came under sanctions Logistical disruptions including decisions by Western firms to suspend deliveries to Russia mattered too The early depreciation of the rouble also dampened Russian demand for imports says Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics a consultancyRussia exports meanwhile have held up surprisingly well including those directed to the West Sanctions permit the sale of oil and gas to most of the world to continue uninterrupted And a spike in energy prices has boosted revenues furtherAs a result analysts expect Russia trade surplus to hit record highs in the coming months The IIF reckons that in 2022 the current-account surplus which includes trade and some financial flows could come in at $250bn 15% of last year GDP more than double the $120bn recorded in 2021 That sanctions have boosted Russia trade surplus and thus helped finance the war is disappointing says Mr Vistesen Ms Ribakova reckons that the efficacy of financial sanctions may have reached its limits A decision to tighten trade sanctions must come nextBut such measures could take time to take effect Even if the EU enacts its proposal to ban Russian oil the embargo would be phased in so slowly that the bloc oil imports from Russia would fall by just 19% this year says Liam Peach of Capital Economics a consultancy The full impact of these sanctions would be felt only at the start of 2023by which point Mr Putin will have amassed billions to fund his war For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 12th 2022,The crypto infrastructure cracks,IT HAS BEEN a vicious year for financial markets and more punishing still for crypto assets More than half the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has been wiped out since November On May 12th bitcoin traded at around $29000 just 40% of its all-time high in November; ether has slumped by a similar amount The share price of the leading crypto-industry stock Coinbase an exchange is half what it was a week ago falling 26% in a single day after it reported earnings and disclosed that users’ deposits on its platform were not necessarily protected in the event that the firm went bust The sell-off comes at the same time as tech stocks high-yield bonds and other risky assets have swooned as the Federal Reserve has begun raising interest ratesMuch of the technology and the jargon of the crypto-sphere is bewildering still to most people in traditional finance Yet the dynamics of recent days bear the hallmarks of spectacular financial collapses of old Take what has happened to stablecoins a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another currency sometimes a conventional one like the dollar These are part of the plumbing of the crypto system: they act as a bridge between conventional banks where people use dollars and the “on-blockchain” world where people use crypto It is stablecoins’ interaction with traditional finance that has led regulators to fret about the impact they could have on financial stabilityAdded together all stablecoins the largest of which are tether and USD coin operated by Circle are worth around $170bn Terra a smaller stablecoin that had a market capitalisation of $187bn a week ago has unravelled in recent days Even tether peg came under pressure on May 12th The events resemble the confidence crises that have preceded every bank runEvery stablecoin has a mechanism to maintain its peg The simplest and safest method is to hold a dollar in a bank account or in safe liquid assets like Treasury bills for each stablecoin token The token can be traded freely by buyers and sellers; when a seller wants to offload their stablecoin they can either sell it on the open market or redeem it for its dollar value from the issuer USD coin uses this methodOthers like terra are called “algorithmic stablecoins” because they use an automated process to support the peg But their main distinguishing feature is the way in which they are backed Terra is backed with luna a cryptocurrency issued by the same firm that issues terra The theory was that holders of terra could always redeem it for one dollar worth of luna A week ago when luna was trading at $85 a piece that meant a terra holder could redeem it for 00118 lunas The process was managed by a smart contractlines of code that execute automated transactionsthat created more luna when a terra holder wanted to redeem If for some reason terra was trading at less than $1 then arbitrageurs would swoop in buy a terra redeem it for luna and sell them for a profitThat system worked well enough as long as luna had some market value But on May 9th the price of luna began to slide On May 10th it was worth around $30 The following day it fell to less than $150 At present it is trading at about 3 cents As luna fell people began to sell terra tooand arbitrageurs failed to swoop in to save the peg by redeeming their terra for luna instead staying away The terra peg broke and by May 11th had dipped as low as 30 cents before recovering to 40 centsIt is unclear what will happen to terra now Its market cap has sunk to $45bn Its founders have supposedly propped it up by selling off some of the $35bn-worth of bitcoin they had in reserve and are trying to come up with a new way to restore the peg Its unravelling has had wider consequences For one the broken peg put pressure on other stablecoins notably tether the biggest which briefly dipped to 95 cents on May 12th That jeopardises the plumbing of the crypto system as a whole The perception that these assets might not be stable will deter widespread adoption and damage trust in themPerhaps reassuringly for the crypto universe though the flight from stablecoins has not been indiscriminatejust as in bank runs past where depositors would flee the bad banks for the good Holders have sold off terra and tether which has previously been fined by New York Attorney General for misleading investors about the amount and quality of the assets backing its stablecoin But they have seemingly bought tokens perceived to be of higher quality like USD coin which publishes regular audited reports on what backing it holds The trouble with terra did not even upset the other major “algorithmic” stablecoin daiStill the failure of the terra-and-luna system does not come at an auspicious time That the rout in cryptocurrency has troubled stablecoinsa core part of the crypto-financial plumbingmay augur ill for the resilience of the system writ large And there are strains appearing in the traditional financial system The stock and bond market routs have caused some risky issuers to delay planned debt sales citing poor “market conditions” Others could not attract investors even at double-digit yields The era of free money in America has come to an end and cracks are appearing in all kinds of financial marketsFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 7th 2022,Will an ever feebler currency save or sink Japan economy?,T HE LAST time the Japanese yen dipped below 130 to the American dollar in 2002 China economy was smaller than France Vladimir Putin was meeting Western officials with a smile and Eminem a rapper was atop the pop-music charts The yen slide to that abyss first reached on April 28th and then every day since has been precipitous: it stood at just 115 to the dollar at the start of this year Japanese policymakers have begun to fret leading markets to speculate about whether they will intervene to halt the fall That would probably prove futile: deep forces are driving the yen depreciationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe most important one is the widening gap in interest rates between Japan and America see chart While prices have risen sharply in America inflation in Japan has remained below the Bank of Japan BoJ 2% target And though inflation may touch that mark later this year the BoJ reckons it is being fuelled by one-off increases in costs; idiosyncrasies of Japan labour market have meant limited wage growth As a result even as the Federal Reserve has begun tightening rates the BoJ has maintained its ultra-loose stance At a monetary-policy meeting last week the BoJ reaffirmed that direction pledging to keep buying ten-year bonds to help control the yield curve With more money to be made holding American bonds than Japanese ones investors have snubbed the latter dampening demand for the yenTrade also plays a role in the yen woes Japan current-account balance went into the red in December Rising import costs which the Ukraine crisis has made worse have been the main culprit: fuel and raw materials make up roughly one-third of Japan import bill In order to buy pricier foreign goods importers have been forced to sell more yen Japan borders have remained closed to inbound tourism due to the pandemic further weakening Japan balance of paymentsPolicymakers have traditionally seen a weak yen as a positive for Japan and its powerful export-focused industries Some still do They also now hope a bit of cost-push inflation may help to break Japan entrenched deflationary mindset and to force zombie firms out of the market Yet the yen has sunk to such lows that concerns are mounting Consumers are getting squeezed by rising import prices; the government announced another fiscal-stimulus package in April to ease the pain ahead of upper-house elections expected for July Business sentiment has also turned even in the manufacturing sectors says Baba Naohiko of Goldman Sachs an investment bankOne reason is Japanese firms’ gradual but sustained efforts to mitigate the risks of currency appreciation by offshoring production “The flip side” Mr Baba says “is that they can’t reap as many benefits from depreciation” The stuff that is still exported from Japan tends to be high-value-added goods which tend to be less responsive to changes in exchange rates The pandemic and supply-chain snags have also hampered the export of some of these products such as automobilesSome reckon the yen could continue falling perhaps to 150 to the dollar a level unseen even during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 when it fell to 147 to the greenback Inside the BoJ some have argued for shortening the target of the yield-curve control policy from ten-year bonds to five-year ones a form of soft tightening but that seems unlikely in the remainder of the term of the current governor Kuroda Haruhiko which runs until April 2023 A turning point might come when Japan reopens to foreign tourists as expected following the elections Ultimately though argues Jesper Koll of Monex Group a financial-services firm “the yen fall from grace will stop and reverse exactly when Japanese investors begin buying their mother markets” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 7th 2022,India begins the privatisation of its huge life-insurance company,IN 1956 AS part of its experiment with embracing socialism India created the Life Insurance Company of India LIC by nationalising and lumping together 245 firms The experiment took a while to conclude In 2000 India allowed private firms to sell life insurance again Two decades later it is selling a 35% sliver of LIC on the public market a first step in what is intended to be a full privatisation Orders will be taken from investors between May 4th and May 9th Trading is due to commence on May 17thListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scale of LIC is such that the sale of even this trivial stake will bring in $27bn making it the fifth-largest public offering of the year globally and the largest in India history One of the reasons stated by the company for such a small percentage being sold is that selling more might crowd out investment in other private and public firms in the country capital-constrained market Out of similar concerns market regulators are already considering waiving a provision that currently requires the dominant shareholder of a listed firm to reduce its ownership stake below 75% within five yearsOnce listed LIC will have a market valuation of around $80bn making it the fifth-most-valuable life insurer in the world Yet more striking is how thoroughly LIC dominates the Indian market Its utter supremacy has no equivalent in any other major country: LIC has a staggering 286m policies in force and collects 64% of all of India written premiums the share of the largest insurer in Britain is 23%; in China it is 21% The firm has $507bn in assets under management triple the amount of its 23 private competitors combinedAlthough such dominance gives the firm and its products unmatched scalea big advantage in an industry that runs on trustthe 659-page listing prospectus makes it clear that there are cracks in LIC armour Premiums have been growing by 9% annually over the past five years a good performance but one that pales in comparison to its Indian competitors many of which have been growing at twice that rateAnd government ties may come with costs Investors have long suspected that LIC is often required to invest at least some of its river of premiums in the interests of the state rather than in the pursuit of profits quietly seeding problems Included in the prospectus 47 pages of risk factors are LIC large investment in IL&FS a government-supported infrastructure-investment fund that went spectacularly bust in 2018 and its majority stake in another formerly government-controlled entity IDBI Bank which it bought as its contribution to a 2019 bail-out Also featured are equity investments purchased over the years for 88bn rupees $115m currently valued at 2bn and debt investments of 113bn rupees 54bn of which are classified as non-performing assetsA public listing and the transparency that must accompany it may alter this approach But concerns about hidden problems and continued interference by the government are worrying investors which helps to explain why the offering is being priced so low Until recently there had been expectations that LIC would be valued at three times its “Indian Embedded Value” an approach based on the present value of future profits derived from expected premiums like most other Indian private insurance firms Instead LIC shares are likely to be sold at only 11 times suggesting buyers have serious reservationsStill in time the most salient detail about the listing may have nothing to do with price and size and everything to do with the fact that it happened at all When the newly reelected administration of Narendra Modi first proposed a public sale of a stake in LIC in early 2020 it was derided as an empty political promise Highly publicised efforts to flog other state-controlled assets most notably Air India had flopped multiple times In October of that year however Air India was finally soldto Tata Group from which it had been seized in 1953 LIC return to the markets after almost as long a gap is not without snags But it suggests a cycle may have genuinely if not entirely come to an end For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 7th 2022,The Fed balance-sheet is about to shrink Wall Street is not ready,CONSIDER THE life of a Treasury bill or bond Typically once or twice a week a batch of fresh Treasuries are born Their first home is usually briefly an investment bank's dealing desk Those dealers might hold on to a few for themselves but generally they distribute the bulk to more permanent owners like the bond portfolios of a mutual fund a foreign government or a company or the Federal Reserve A certain slice will swap hands repeatedlysome $700bn or so are traded each business daybut many will stay put for their lifetimes Their deaths are predetermined: they come of age or “mature” as little as one month or as long as 30 years after their birth at which point they are settled and cease to existListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Fed is the single largest holder of Treasuriesits balance-sheet is where many of those securities have found their permanent home Thanks to bond-buying schemes put in place to ease monetary conditions during the pandemic the Fed now holds some $58trn-worth of Treasuries a quarter of the $232trn-worth the government has issued see chartit also holds $27trn-worth of mortgage-backed securities On May 4th however Jerome Powell the chairman of the Fed said it would start shrinking this giant portfolio a process known as “quantitative tightening” QT in June The reversal could spark a repeat of the temporary yet troubling breakdowns that the world most important financial market has suffered in recent yearson a bigger scaleAccording to the policy statement released on May 4th the Fed will reduce its balance-sheet not by actively making sales but by letting bonds that have reached the end of their lives mature without buying a new bill or bond to replace them By September if all has gone to plan the Fed portfolio will be shrinking by $95bn a month split between $60bn of Treasuries and $35bn of mortgage-backed bonds At that pace the Fed balance-sheet will shrivel by more than $1trn over the next year That is “quite the clip” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford UniversityThere are two reasons why investors and policymakers are watching QT closely The first is its potentially vast impact on monetary policy Estimates of the effect of bond-buying on the cost of money varybut any downward pressure on interest rates exerted as the Fed bought up Treasuries is likely to be reversed as its holdings start to ebb Two-year Treasury yields have already climbed from 08% in January 2022 to 27% as investors have come to expect quicker balance-sheet shrinking and faster rate increases On May 4th Mr Powell announced a 50-basis-point rate rise the first increase of that size since 2000 and signalled more would be “on the table at the next couple of meetings”It is also possible that QT will cause the Treasury market to malfunctionthe second reason for concern Its smooth running matters well beyond America: Treasury rates are a crucial benchmark for pricing virtually all other financial assets globally And recent history is not encouraging A series of episodesincluding the “flash rally” of 2014; stress in the repo market a key money market where Treasuries can be swapped for cash in September 2019; and the covid-19 shock of March 2020 in which the Treasury market in effect ceased to function for periods of timehave created serious doubts about how robust the Treasury market isEach of the episodes had slightly different causes Regardless of the robustness of the Treasury market there was little that would have stopped the extreme nature of the covid-19 shock from rocking it The repo crisis was in part the result of some perverse incentives caused by post-crisis regulation that deterred banks from holding Treasuries But both were exacerbated by a deeper issue says Randal Quarles a former vice-chair for supervision at the Fed which is that the Treasury market “has grown out of its waist size”A combination of financial-crisis stimulus fiscal deficits under President Trump and pandemic-era splurge have caused the Treasury market to grow nearly five-fold since 2007 At the same time fresh regulation imposed on investment banks which are the main conduits in Treasury markets such as the introduction of the supplemental-leverage ratio which measures the total size of bank assets relative to the amount of capital they hold has restricted their ability to facilitate Treasury-market activity The rule is not very friendly to low-risk activities such as holding Treasuries A report released last year by the Group of Thirty an economics advisory body warned that “the aggregate amount of capital allocated to market-making by bank-affiliated dealers has not kept pace” with its lightning growthTo combat issues that have cropped up in the past the Fed has taken measures to increase liquidity such as opening up a “standing facility” for selected intermediaries to swap Treasuries for cash But few think that this is a panacea for dysfunction Mr Duffie favours replacing the current market structure which relies on broker-dealers with a central-clearing system This would make it easier for market participants to interact directlyfor one mutual fund say to sell to another without relying on a bank to intermediate the transaction But the fix would be no match for “the scale of the problem” says Mr Quarles A more urgent task he argues is to loosen the regulatory shackles hampering investment banks from supporting the market That is unlikely to happen soon: there is little appetite in Washington for weakening bank regulationIn the absence of an obvious fix the unknowable fallout from the Fed pull-out is adding to the uncertainty created by rising rates stagflation and geopolitical ructions Liquidity in the Treasury market is already thinning: the “yield error” captured by the Bloomberg Treasury liquidity index which measures the difference between the yield a Treasury is traded at and a measure of fair value is 12% higher than it was in January It has more than doubled since August 2021 The growing possibility of renewed dysfunction could deter investors from dealing further making it yet likelier that the market seizes up The once-placid life of Treasury bills and bonds could get more chaotic for a while For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 7th 2022,Why long-term economic growth often disappoints,FROM THE point of view of the 1950s America economic progress over the 70 years that followed has been a huge disappointment Futurists foresaw a world of super-pills space farms and cities encased in glass Science and technology would engineer unending riches and everything consumers could ever want Yet the speed of gains achieved during the Space Age it turned out soon ebbed: between 2000 and 2019 America real income per head grew by 12% a year on average down from 2% between 1980 and 1999 and 25% in the 1950s And instead of flying cars Peter Thiel a venture capitalist once jibed “we got 140 characters”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA new paper suggests such disappointment is not warrantedbecause it stems from an equally huge misunderstanding of how economic progress happens Thomas Philippon a professor of finance at New York University argues the post-war experience was unusual Looking at American data going back to 1890 and British data from 1600 to 1914 he finds that when technological progress is properly understood the world has been on broadly the same path for centuries In the grand scheme of things in other words there has been no slowdown at allMost economists’ starting point for thinking about growth is Robert Solow 1956 paper “A contribution to the theory of growth” Mr Solow model for predicting a country long-term wealth relies on what he dubs the “production function” It is a mathematical black box: on one side labour and capital go in; out the other come all the consumer goods and services that contribute to people standard of living One way of growing is obvious: shove more labour and capital into the box But that cannot deliver improvements for ever Adding more labour means the output is divided between more workers And capital wears out so more investment is needed over time just to stay putInstead long-term growth can only come from improving the black boxthe way in which labour and capital are combined The fancy name economists give to this is total factor productivity TFP though they sometimes refer to it with more intuitive labels such as technology or knowledge You might think of it as a recipe On one side lie labour and capital the ingredients On the other is the finished dish: economic output TFP is an attempt to measure how effective the recipe is at combining the ingredients which in turn depends on factors including the level of education on offer to the population the quality of business management and the depth of scientific know-howMr Solow assumed that the annual contribution of TFP to GDP would grow exponentially This may have been for purely mathematical reasons: he wanted his model economy to grow at a fixed rate of say 2% a year which required ever larger gains as GDP got bigger to keep the pace of growth constant Later economists including Paul Romer like Mr Solow a Nobel prizewinner have tried to work out the chemistry underpinning TFP presumed exponential growth Their theories usually contend that some investment goes not into capital but into research and development And because knowledge can be freely copied they observe this investment has an increasing marginal product meaning that each prior bit of research makes the next bit of research more effective Knowledge thus cascades out creating more knowledge as it does akin to how a virus spreads in the early stage of an epidemicThe problem according to Mr Philippon is that TFP does not actually grow exponentially Using the most popular data sources for long-term growth he compares predictions from two different models to observed trends in TFP A linear patternwhich he calls “additive growth”consistently fits better with how progress has actually unfolded Contrary to existing theories that suggests previous research does not make the next idea any easier to find It also explains why as Mr Philippon puts it some economists keep predicting some future wave of innovation that just never comesThis is not a counsel of despair While the rate of growth in percentage terms may be slowing Mr Philippon model predicts that the size of any increment is roughly constant Societies do get richerbut just not as fast as generally thoughtEncouragingly Mr Philippon also finds evidence of moments when the rate of TFP growth does temporarily accelerate and the annual increment gets higher His paper plots one such moment in Britain between 1650 and 1700 and another around 1830 consistent with when historians date the first and second Industrial Revolutions He also finds one in America around 1930 which he credits to the adoption of electrification Such moments only seem to take place about every century or so But they do help to explain Mr Solow mistake: it would have been easy for him as he was living through one of these periods of acceleration to fall for the illusion of exponential progressThe ways of growth are inscrutableMr Philippon statistical analysis does not speak to TFP deeper conceptual problems One is that capital is hard to value There is usually a difference between its historical cost suitably depreciated and the discounted value of the profits it will eventually produce Unlike labour which can be quantified in hours there is no non-monetary unit with which to value oil rigs and pharmaceutical patents alike After Mr Solow 1956 paper came out a group of economists at the University of Cambridge showed that its method for valuing capital was circular a point Mr Solow followers conceded But the model is still widely used regardlessSimilar problems bedevil TFP itself Statistical techniques that try to measure the concept of “knowledge” typically bundle all the variation in growth that cannot be explained by changes in the workforce or investment into the black box Hence TFP other less flattering namethe “Solow residual” Rather than a reliable metric of society level of knowledge TFP so far seems to remain in the words of a Solow critic a “measure of our ignorance” Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How would an energy embargo affect Germany economy?

Most European buyers have already ruled out paying directly in roubles But Moscow is offering a compromise Buyers would open two accounts with Gazprombank a lender that is not under sanctions They would pay euros into the first and ask the bank to convert the sum into roubles and deposit the money into the second account which would then be wired to GazpromMany European countries dislike the plan which would look as though they were giving in to Russian bullying and risks creating legal headaches They will fall into three groups One which includes Belgium Britain and Spain imports little or no gas directly from Russia and may refuse to compromise Another group includes big buyers such as Germany and Italy which will struggle to replace imports quickly; they may take the deal A third set of waverers includes countries that are only partially dependent on Russia and may also have contracts that are soon to expireEven this situation would create uncertainty One country being cut off could have knock-on effects on others for instance if gas transits through it to other places Nor is it clear who will take the Russian compromise or whether Russia might eventually turn the taps off anywayIf Germany say were cut off gas markets would go haywire European prices are already six times higher than they were a year ago They would soar to new peaks luring more LNG from the rest of the world and causing prices elsewhere to rise in turn Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies a think-tank reckons a full shutdown of Russian gas to Europe may well cause a global recession Russia game of poker is getting scarierand those losing their shirts could include bystanders too For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

 Apr 30th 2022,Are emerging economies on the verge of another “lost decade”?,EMERGING ECONOMIES hoping to grow their way into the ranks of the rich have faced a seemingly never-ending series of setbacks in recent years Trade tensions a pandemic supply-chain snarls inflation and war have together dealt them serious blows Over the past three years more than half the population of the emerging world lived in countries where income growth in purchasing-power-parity terms lagged behind that in Americathe first such episode since the 1980sListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe IMF forecasts that economic output across emerging markets will expand by 38% this year and 44% in 2023 Both figures have been revised down sharply since last year and fall short of the 5% average annual rate in the decade before covid-19 As the contours of the post-pandemic landscape start to come into focus a lost decade for the world poorer countriesa period of slow growth recurring financial crises and social unrestlooks increasingly plausibleEmerging economies have experienced many ups and downs before In the 1960s and 1970s they enjoyed rapid growth which fed optimism about the prospects for the world poor But the good times were followed by what William Easterly of New York University described as the lost decades of the 1980s and 1990s Over the ten years to 1990 annual growth in GDP per person in the median emerging economy fell below zero see chart From the late 1990s onwards a new boom began which reset expectations about the economic potential of the developing world More recently though the pendulum has swung back again and growth has proved harder to come by Emerging markets face structural impediments such as tougher financial-market conditions and changing trade patterns reminiscent of those that confronted them in the 1980s and 1990sFinancial pressures pose the most acute threat In the early 1980s the Federal Reserve raised interest rates dramatically as it sought to tame inflation For poor economies that had borrowed heavily in the preceding years the ensuing tightening in financial conditions and strengthening of the dollar were too much to bear Waves of debt and banking crises followedSome of those conditions seem familiar today Both public and private debt in the emerging world rose steadily as a share of GDP during the 2010s and rocketed during the pandemic Public-debt ratios across middle-income economies now stand at record highs and indebtedness in the poorest countries has risen towards the debilitating levels of the 1990s Of the world 70-odd low-income countries more than 10% including Chad and Somalia already face unsustainable debt burdens Another 50% including Ethiopia and Laos are at high risk of being in a similar position according to the World Bank A decade ago only about a third of poor countries were in or at high risk of debt distressRussia invasion of Ukraine has fuelled surges in food and energy costs Wheat and oil are both about 50% more expensive than they were a year ago For importing countries this increases the fiscal costs of food and energy subsidies drains hard-currency reserves and weighs on economic growth Rising prices also intensify pressure on central banks in the rich world to tighten monetary policy Investors expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by nearly three percentage points in 2022; that would be the largest rate rise in a single year since the early 1990s Add in the effect of a shrinking Fed balance-sheet and the tightening this year could be the most dramatic since the 1980sMarkets are already heaping pressure on vulnerable emerging economies As capital flows to America to take advantage of higher rates the dollar is strengthening: it is up by more than 10% over the past year Funding costs in the emerging world are rising with it The yield on the hard-currency debt of the median emerging economy has risen by more than a third since the summer The share of issuers with bonds trading at distressed levels has more than doubled to just over a fifth according to the IMF That includes Ukraine as well as Egypt and GhanaMore countries will probably follow the lead of Sri Lanka which on April 12th defaulted on its hard-currency government debt Nonetheless the systemic crises that were a feature of the previous lost decades may be avoided Many middle-income economies have bolstered their financial defences since the 1980s by beefing up foreign-exchange reserves for instance Investors have become more discerning reducing the risk of wider contagion The bigger worry instead is that debt loads will hit growth by limiting governments’ room to cut taxes and invest in education and infrastructure Local banks that have lent heavily to governments may find their capacity to lend to private borrowers impaired if the bonds they hold lose value Home-country government debt now makes up about 17% of bank assets across emerging economies up from 13% in the early 2010s and well above the 75% average in rich countriesAnother headwind comes from global trade Developing economies’ fortunes have long risen and fallen in line with it From 1960 to 1980 goods trade as a share of world GDP doubled from 9% to 18%; during the lost decades by contrast it stagnated Trade then soared again as global supply chains expanded across East and South-East Asia in particular But that interconnectedness is once more at risk Geopolitical tensions national campaigns for self-sufficiency and concerns about supply-chain reliability may weigh on trade reducing poor economies’ opportunities to borrow technology and know-how from foreign firms and sell to the rich worldThe global economy will also suffer from the sputtering of the largest emerging market of them all and the world primary growth engine: China Between 1970 and 2000 America and Europe accounted for nearly half of global GDP growth The sharp and sustained slowdown in rich-world growth that began in the 1970s thus weighed heavily on the global economy and the prospects for the emerging world Fortunes turned in the 2000s however as an explosive expansion in China led it to contribute more to global growth than America and Europe combined A modest deceleration in China to GDP growth rates of around 5% would not doom the global economy to stagnation Draconian covid lockdowns a protracted property-market bust and the potential costs of geopolitical misadventures however could do great damageSome emerging markets stand to benefit from an era of stagnation Firms wary of dependence on China could move production to other low-cost places Rich countries hoping to prevent poorer ones from drawing closer to Russia and China could lower trade barriers and increase investment abroad boosting growth prospects in the process High commodity prices while they last will buoy the fortunes of food energy and metals exportersOverall however the higher debts and forgone investment in human and physical capital of the past few years will take a heavy toll The IMF forecasts that GDP across the emerging world will remain some 5% below its pre-pandemic trend at the end of 2024 By comparison GDP in most of the rich world is expected to be less than 1% below trend Without bold initiatives to lower debt burdens invest in public goods and expand trade such mediocre performance might be just a taste of what is to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 30th 2022,A divergence in consumer surveys adds to recession worries for America,AMERICANS HAVE much to like and much to dislike about the economy these days Thanks to a red-hot labour market it is unusually easy both to find work and negotiate a pay increase At the same time rising prices have taken a bite out of their earnings in real terms To get a handle on how people perceive these opposing trends analysts can look at surveys that measure consumers’ sentiment about the economy There is however a problem at the moment Like the contradictory trends the two main surveys are presenting different picturesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe first is a survey of consumers by the University of Michigan Started in 1946 it is respected as a leading indicator of whether Americans are planning to spend money or tighten their belts As such it is looking grim The preliminary reading for April was near its lowest point in more than a decadeand crucially was 26% lower than its level a year earlier Falls this sharp are often associated with recessionsThe other survey is the Conference Board gauge of consumer confidence Established in 1967 it is an equally respected snapshot of the American consumer And it is markedly more upbeat A sub-index measuring what consumers think about the present situation is near its highest level since the start of the pandemic though a separate sub-index measuring their expectations is far more subduedThe divergence between the two surveys can largely be explained by their different focuses Both consist of five questions but of a very different kind Two of the questions in the Michigan survey ask respondents about their personal finances and one asks whether they think it a good time to make a big household purchase such as a television These questions are likely to pick up current concerns about inflation The Michigan survey asks nothing about personal job prospects By contrast two of the five questions in the Conference Board survey are specifically about employment conditions Its survey is in other words calibrated to pick up the current optimism about the labour marketUnfortunately for the American economy the rosier Conference Board survey does not simply cancel out the gloomier Michigan alternative Such a big divergence is itself a signal Economists at Deutsche Bank say that compared with the Michigan survey the Conference Board measure tends to be dominated by lagging indicators that perform well late in the cycle making the spread between the current-conditions gauge in the two surveys their favourite indicator of cyclical consumer sentiment It is flashing red today with the gap close to its widest in more than half a century At such a level it signals that the probability of a recession is around 50% over the next yearroughly twice as high as many economists currently estimate Whatever the true figure is it seems clear that consumers are feeling a pinch from inflation and are increasingly anxious about the near future despite benefiting from a strong jobs market todayEconomists look at many other indicators beyond surveys of consumers of course Financial conditions particularly the shrinking gap between yields on long-dated Treasuries and shorter-term bonds are another portent of slower growth Orders for durable goods by contrast point to resilience Ultimately all these indicators confirm what is all too evident from past precedents for such a hot economy: that the Federal Reserve will need ample skill and good fortune if it is to tame price pressures without inducing a recession For more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The implications of low investment yields,IN 1988 STEVE GUTTENBERG a comic actor appeared on a British talk show At one point he was asked why he had not appeared in “Police Academy 5” having starred in the earlier films He replied that in his view all the important philosophical questions had been addressed in the first four moviesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis brings us to the more serious business of investing and a sequel of a very different kind Ten years ago Antti Ilmanen a finance whizz published “Expected Returns” a brilliant distillation of investment theory practice and wisdom His latest book “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns” is an update taking in a decade worth of additional research and data Mr Ilmanen has read all the books and papers sorting the good stuff from the junk He has a gift for explaining clearly and concisely the lessons of this research for investors The new book is as invaluable a resource as the old one If it has a fault it is that it does not quite address all the important philosophical questions A sequel may be necessaryStart though with a recap of the expected-returns framework There are two sources of return on an investment: income and capital gain The income on for instance a government bond is the interest or “coupon” paid once or twice a year Bond prices and yields move inversely So when interest rates fall as they did for much of the past four decades bond investors enjoy a capital gain In essence a capital gain of this kind brings forward future returns You get the income now you were going to get later But as yields fall ever lower the scope for further capital gains becomes more limited So low yields imply low expected returns This bond-like logic holds for other assetsequities property private equity and so on Dividend and rental yields have fallen in response to the secular fall in interest rates Owners of all kinds of assets have experienced windfall gains But today low yields imply low expected returns in the futureWhat now? As Mr Ilmanen sees it low expected returns can materialise through either “slow” or “fast” pain In the slow-pain scenario assets remain expensive and investors receive desultory bond coupons equity dividends and rental receipts for years on end In the fast-pain scenario yields revert to their higher historical averages This implies a spell of brutal capital losses followed by fairer returns thereafter The choice is between well-heeled stagnation and a crashMr Ilmanen is too much of an epistemological sceptic to put all his chips on one scenario He is also too careful an analyst to miss that low inflation made the high-asset-price low-yield 2010s what they were Many of the factors that kept a lid on inflation in that decadeglobalisation efficient supply-chain management tight fiscal policy an expanding global workforceare now attenuating or unwinding Mr Ilmanen hunch is that the 2020s will see something of a reversal of the investment trends of the preceding decade But he generally eschews investing on hunchesFaced with lower expected returns investors have three courses of action: they can take more risk to reach for higher returns; they can save more; or they can accept reality and play the hand they have been dealt as well as they can The first approach may increase returns but also makes them more uncertain Saving more means sacrificing today for the sake of tomorrow a highly personal choice Understandably Mr Ilmanen focus is on the third approach He sets out a chapter-by-chapter analysis of various investment assets and styles He advises how to put them together in a truly diversified portfolio Along the way he explains why market timing is a snare you end up taking too little risk; what the true appeal of private equity is not superior returns; and why portfolio insurance will not save you it is too expensive in the long runThere are shortcomings A quarter of the 500+ references are from authors affiliated with AQR Capital Management Mr Ilmanen employer This weighting gives the book a less independent air than “Expected Returns” Readers would have benefited greatly from a chapter on the implications of low expected returns for different sorts of savers The fast-pain scenario for instance is surely preferable for young savers to whom the book is dedicated Perhaps this and other gaps will be filled in “Expected Returns III” Even Mr Guttenberg has been teasing fans with the prospect of “Police Academy 8” The big philosophical questions are never truly settledRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:A requiem for negative government-bond yields Apr 23rdThe complicated politics of crypto and web3 Apr 16thBonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

tangle of complex interactions The breakdown of a seemingly insignificant link in the chain can disrupt firms that are either upstream or downstream of it causing wider damage In a paper published in 2019 David Baqaee of the University of California Los Angeles and Emmanuel Farhi of Harvard University used a model of complex supply networks to study the oil shocks of the 1970s Linkages between firms and sectors meant that the overall economic effect was quite a bit larger than the direct impact on sectors that used oil Recent research on the effect of social distancing on America by Jean-Noël Barrot then of HEC Paris and his co-authors finds that ripple effects through production networks accounted for more than half of the total economic impactAnother much-studied instance of disruption is the earthquake that struck north-eastern Japan in 2011 As the worst-hit areas only accounted for less than a twentieth of GDP local disruption should not have had a noticeable nationwide effect But it did In a review Vasco Carvalho of the University of Cambridge and colleagues disentangle the impact on the affected areas from the ripple effects along supply chains and find that the latter accounted for more than half the hit to Japanese growthResearchers have also uncovered the types of links and mechanisms that enable shocks to propagate widely The shutdown of a company altogether is one way in which a jolt can create a much bigger economic hit according to a paper by Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi of Northwestern University as well as another study by Mr Baqaee That explains why Alan Mulally then the chief executive of Ford a carmaker urged American lawmakers to bail out his competitors during the global financial crisis Ford feared the collapse of the auto sector suppliers which would cause severe disruptions at its own plants tooIntimate commercial relationships such as those within firms tend to be especially affected because they are harder to replace Another study of Japan 2011 earthquake by Christoph Boehm of the University of Texas Austin and others finds that the American subsidiaries of Japanese firms also suffered as did their suppliers Other research also concludes that the more customised the relationship between firms and their suppliers the bigger the ripple effects Mr Barrot and Julien Sauvagnat of Bocconi University examine 30 years of American natural disasters and find that disruption to just one supplier leads to a loss in sales for a downstream firm of two to three percentage points which considering that most suppliers provide a small portion of a firm production inputs is a sizeable fallSuch findings provide fodder for opponents of an energy embargo in Germany And some estimates of the impact of an embargo also suggest that the short-term disruptions could be large Six leading German research institutes conclude that an embargo could lead to a GDP loss for the country of around 1% this year and 5% in 2023 The Bundesbank estimates a hit of 5% in 2022Yet there are two reasons why things need not be so bad For a start just as past experience shows that supply disruptions can have sizeable near-term effects it also shows that the economy in aggregate has a great ability to adjust In 2010 China banned the export of rare-earth metals to Japan one of the world biggest users of the minerals Japanese firms were able to quickly substitute away from previously cheap rare earths and find alternative supplies according to research by Eugene Gholz of the University of Notre Dame and Llewelyn Hughes of the Australian National University In a study of the potential effects of a Russian energy embargo on Europe Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and his co-authors find that while the hit could be large it would be partly offset by the economy ability to adapt The overall impact they reckon could be in the region of 05-3% of GDPProduction interruptedMoreover it is within the gift of governments to mitigate the short-term pain of supply disruptions EU officials for instance are mulling stricter sanctions on energy imports from Russia The more notice firms receive about the measures which could include a tax on Russian energy the easier adjusting to them is likely to become Past episodes suggest that if policymakers do want to change regulations or trade relationships they should do so consistently and carefully A liberalisation of Indian trade in the 1990s led to little wider disruption because it was gradual helping firms adjust A recent study by Alessandra Peter of New York University and Cian Ruane of the IMF points out that Indian firms were able to find substitutes for inputsGovernments could also take into account the fact that businesses may not do enough to ensure that networks are solid in the near term Matthew Elliott of the University of Cambridge and others find that firms might invest in the robustness of their supply chains if they have a business case to do so But they might not seek to ensure the resilience of the wider network because they do not stand to reap the rewards from such investment Encouraging firms and households to shift away from using fossil fuels as a tariff would do could enhance that resilience Managed well Germany supply disruptions need not

 Apr 23rd 2022,Does high inflation matter?,IT STARTED IN America but the surge in inflation has spread to the rest of the rich world Consumer prices across the OECD club of mostly rich countries are rising by 77% year on year the fastest pace of increase in at least three decades In the Netherlands inflation is nearing 10% even higher than in America while in Estonia it is over 15% How forcefully should central banks respond to the inflationary surge? The answer depends on how much damage inflation is causing And that depends on whom you askListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInflation is regarded as costly because it erodes people savings and distorts price signals And there are unquestionably instances when it has brought an economy to its knees During Weimar Germany period of hyperinflation in the 1920s people savings evaporated eliminating the middle class and paving the way for the rise of fascism Inflation also spiralled out of control in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe As price signals broke down millions went without foodBut in more moderate inflationary episodes such as the current one the evidence for economic carnage is weaker One common worry is that increases in prices outpace rises in wages causing people real incomes to decline This has almost certainly been happening across rich countries in recent months American real hourly earnings fell by nearly 3% in the year to MarchOn the whole though economists see a tenuous connection between inflation and workers’ real living standards Sometimes prices rise faster than wages; sometimes they do not British real wages grew strongly during the inflationary era of the 1970s According to a study published in 1975 American workers whether unionised or not had seen inflation-busting pay rises in the preceding decade The Economist has looked at data for 35 OECD countries going as far back as 1990 In years when inflation exceeded 5% we find real wages rose on average Inflation can also help the unemployed find jobs even as it hurts people already in work After the global financial crisis of 2007-09 sterling depreciated lifting inflation in Britain and reducing real wages Companies could then afford to hire more workersThe notion that inflation messes with price signals another putative economic cost is also exaggerated at moderate levels Capitalism allocates resources via movements in relative prices: if the price of cars rises compared with that for bicycles more cars should eventually be produced The worry is that inflation disrupts this process making it harder to discern the “true” relative prices of cars and bicyclesIn a paper published in 2018 however Emi Nakamura of the University of California Berkeley and colleagues examine price dispersion for the same sorts of products over time Looking at the period of high inflation in the 1970s they find “no evidence that prices deviated more from their optimal level” than just before the pandemic when inflation was far lower The “strong conclusions about [the] optimality of low inflation rates [in this regard] need to be reassessed” they concludeSophisticated papers such as these back up a broader body of work going back decades that questions the link between inflation and growth A paper published by the IMF in 2014 noted that “few empirical studies have even tried to find costs of single-digit inflation” In 1996 Michael Bruno and William Easterly then both of the World Bank found “no evidence of any relationship between inflation and growth at annual inflation rates less than 40%” The next year Paul Krugman wrote that “even though inflation is universally regarded as a terrible scourge efforts to measure its costs come up with embarrassingly small numbers”So does the rich world current bout of inflation have minimal costs or even none at all? The trouble for economists is that there is a world outside their research Few people know or care about their results But they know what they think about inflation: they utterly implacably loathe itInflation seems to hold a special place in the public consciousness Our analysis of English-language newspapers and blog posts suggests that during the 2010s media organisations mentioned inflation 50% more frequently than they mentioned unemployment even though joblessness during that decade was a far bigger economic problem In the 1990s Robert Shiller of Yale University asked people in a number of countries about their opinions on inflation and compared them with the views of economists He found that ordinary people held much more extreme views on the subject than the academics who study it for a livingPeople believe that inflation makes them poorer They worry it makes it harder to plan And they believe that inflation is a sign that unscrupulous companies are taking advantage of them two-thirds of Americans ascribe the recent rise in inflation to corporate greed Economists by contrast are more equivocal in their answers More than half of Americans “fully agreed” that preventing high inflation was as important as stopping drug abuse or maintaining educational standards compared with just 18% of economists In the same survey Mr Shiller found that 46% of people wanted the government to lower the price level after an inflation spike ie to engineer deflation something few economists would recommendGet realPerhaps policymakers should just ignore the views of ordinary people If experts find that inflation has surprisingly low costs then what more information is needed to guide policy? Another way of looking at it however is that the psychological costs of high inflation are real and that central bankers and governments should take them into account Fighting inflation by forcefully tightening fiscal or monetary policy is often seen as a hard-nosed choice because it cools the economy and risks provoking a recession In fact it is one of the most populist policies out there Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:What bigger military budgets mean for the economy Apr 16thChina has a celebrated history of policy experiments Apr 9thWill dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

 Apr 23rd 2022,China two-front fight to quash the virus and revive its economy,THE FORTUNES of the world second-biggest economy hinge on two kinds of hesitancy The first is over vaccines China elderly are surprisingly reluctant to get inoculated against covid-19 That has saddled the country with a vulnerable population that could die in large numbers if the government abandons its controversial “zero-covid” policy But this uncompromising stance which tries to stamp out any outbreak of the virus obliges China to impose ruinous lockdowns on some of its most productive cities including Shanghai where some residents have been confined to their homes for over 30 daysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThese limits on movement are wreaking economic havoc Even before the worst restrictions were imposed retail sales shrank by 35% year-on-year in March in nominal terms according to figures released on April 18th Catering services fell by more than 16% Unemployment in China 31 biggest cities is now 6% higher than in 2020 points out Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management Overall GDP grew surprisingly fast by 48% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier But that was mostly because of strength in the first two months of the yearThis quarter could look decidedly worse Ting Lu of Nomura a bank thinks GDP could shrink China rulers are not hiding their concern Earlier this month Li Keqiang the prime minister told local authorities that they should show greater “urgency” in stabilising the economyYet a second kind of hesitancy has marked the government response to the slowdown: a reluctance to stimulate the economy as forcefully as in the past On April 15th the People Bank of China PBoC said it would reduce the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve But it cut these requirements by only 025 percentage points for most banks half as much as expected And it has still not lowered its key policy rates since January before the latest covid outbreak took hold Instead this macro-institution has resorted to micro-management issuing no fewer than 23 instructions to encourage lending for particular purposes such as elderly care transport and grain purchasesWhat is holding the PBoC back? It says it will “refrain from a deluge of strong stimulus policies” and “strike a balance between internal and external equilibria” It may worry that the monetary easing required to preserve growth would jeopardise China external balance with the rest of the world In particular the PBoC may fear that capital would flee if it cut interest rates too boldly just as America Federal Reserve raises rates sharply China has already suffered net capital outflows from its equity markets in recent months as Russia invasion of Ukraine forced foreign investors to face up to geopolitical dangers they would rather not contemplateIf China remains hesitant to ease monetary policy more dramatically it must rely on fiscal stimulus But even here it faces impediments and reluctance The finance ministry for example still has a prudish unwillingness to report a big headline budget deficit Hence much of the extra public spending needed to stabilise growth this year will be carried out by local governments and special funds that do not appear in the headline figuresUnfortunately local authorities are themselves under renewed financial scrutiny Last July the banking regulator issued “Document No 15” instructing banks not to increase the hidden debts of local governments These rules were later shelved But the threat of a future crackdown remains Another directive issued by the finance ministry required local governments to pick spending projects more carefully if they wished to finance them with bondsDespite these intrusions local governments probably have enough money as a group reckons Hui Shan of Goldman Sachs a bank They have carried over unspent funds from last year and received transfers from the central government But the money is not evenly spread “Some provinces have projects but no money others have money but no projects” she saysIn those parts of the country battling covid the limits on stimulus may be logistical rather than financial Lockdowns and other restrictions interfere with the manpower and supply chains necessary for public construction projects Fighting covid may also monopolise officials’ attention Yes local officials are being urged to stabilise the economy with “urgency” But they are also being sacked for losing control of the virus That skews incentives towards cutting infections rather than expanding infrastructure It is hard to be a covid hawk and a fiscal doveIt is possible for stimulus to bypass such bureaucracy In America fiscal easing took the form of “stimmy” cheques paid directly to households China lacks an equivalent system for distributing government largesse The next best thing in theory is cutting income taxes which leaves more money in people pockets to spend But as only a minority of Chinese pay income tax such cuts would have little impact The closest alternative is lower taxes on smaller firms some of which are not much more than household operations anyway Thus about a third of fiscal easing this year will take the form of cuts in taxes and fees for small and medium-sized enterprises according to Goldman SachsAgain however covid poses an obstacle The retailers and other small enterprises targeted by these tax cuts are often the same firms hit hardest by lockdowns and other restrictions If the zero-covid policy deprives a firm of its customers relieving it of taxes is scant consolation A company with zero income does not care what tax rate it paysChina may therefore have to wait until this covid wave subsides before it can revive its economy in earnest And even then it must hope that the economic comeback is not immediately halted by another outbreak Until China elderly become less hesitant about vaccines its economy will stay resistant to stimulus For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

When nominal yields on newly purchased bonds were tumbling and inflation was low investors at least saw the benefit of capital gains on their existing holdings bond prices move inversely to yields Now bond investors must suffer both negative real returns on newly bought bonds and a decline in the value of their stock of holdingsSome assets such as American high-yield corporate bonds and some emerging-market corporate debt benefited when investors first searched for yield The recent change in financial conditions complicates the outlook for them High-yield bonds for example are more likely to offer positive real yields But rising interest rates and the higher possibility of recession make those assets riskier too Some emerging-market bonds may gain favour: China is one of the few countries where short-term real interest rates are positive; Brazil Mexico and South Korea issue inflation-linked debt with yields in positive territory But hedging against currency risk could eat up the entire returnEquity in both public and private markets and underlying assets where returns have some sort of link to nominal economic growth rather than to interest rates alone may be more attractive Assets that carry some pricing powersuch as rental property and commodity and infrastructure investmentsare also likely to be favouredEven as nominal bond yields undergo their most dramatic rises in a generation the picture for real yields will remain familiar to investors acquainted with the pressures of the past decade Unless the world big central banks become drastically more hawkish about inflation and engineer an economic recessionmuch as Paul Volcker then the Federal Reserve chairman did in the 1980sthe scramble for real income could prove to be a decisive force in marketsRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The complicated politics of crypto and web3 Apr 16thBonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

 Apr 23rd 2022,New research spells out the benefits of diverse supply chains,OVER THE quarter-century before the pandemic global manufacturing was transformed by the emergence of complex supply chains through which firms could efficiently produce all sorts of goods at low cost and enormous scale The pandemic put these supply chains through the wringer causing wild swings in demand while forcing repeated lockdowns that frustrated both production and distribution The result has been a surge in shipping delays shortages of critical components and soaring pricesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGovernments have become keener to boost domestic production the better to reduce their vulnerability to disruptions in foreign supplies But new work by the IMF suggests that this would be misguided Supply chains held up better during the pandemic than is often assumed it argues and greater self-sufficiency is likely to leave countries more vulnerable to future shocks not lessThe covid recession was unusual Trade in goods fell sharply at its onsetby 12% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to late 2019but then bounced back faster than has been common in recent downturns To better understand these gyrations the fund economists built a model that predicts trade patterns based on levels of spending within economies They found large differences between the amount and type of trade predicted by the model and what actually happened during the pandemica sign of covid-related weirdnessThe virus distorted trade in part through its effects on domestic economies Places that experienced higher caseloads and more restrictive lockdowns imported more goods than expected given the blow to overall GDP for instance That in part reflects a shift in demand away from services and towards goods such as home electronics and protective equipment Covid also interfered with the production of some goods at home which then needed to be imported insteadBut lockdowns in some places also had spillover effects elsewhere During the first half of 2020 the researchers note about 60% of the decline in a country imports could be explained by lockdowns in its trading partners These ripple effects hit goods that were reliant on long supply chains the hardest But the drag was smaller when the places that were locked down had greater capacity to telework And crucially the effect of restrictions declined over time as working patterns and supply chains adapted Exporters in places that ended strict lockdowns earlier saw big gains in market share with bigger increases occurring in the production of supply-chain-intensive goodsA lack of data means that the fund analysis stops in mid-2021 after which a series of unfortunate events from stranded ships to war led to port backlogs and rising costs Nonetheless the fund reckons the model might suggest how best to protect an economy against disruptions The answer is not by reshoring production but by diversification: sourcing inputs from a wider variety of countries and using components that can easily be substituted for if supply problems ariseIn most countries the vast majority of components used to make goods tend to be sourced domestically About 69% of parts in Europe and more than 80% in the western hemisphere are produced at home for example If a firm were to choose to import a critical component instead it would face a more diverse choice: the market share of the average exporting country in the average industry is a little under a third Re shoring would therefore tend to reduce the diversification of a supply chain rather than increase it by making production even more dependent on a single country: the home economy That could prove costly The fund estimates that in the face of a big disruption one that causes a 25% drop in labour supply in a single large producer of critical inputs the average economy could be expected to suffer a fall in GDP of about 1% Greater diversification stands to reduce the damage by about halfEncouraging diversification is a tricky matter The fund suggests that lowering barriers to trade and investing in infrastructure could help Geopolitical tensions sadly mean that openness to deeper integration is in short supply But the gains to be made at least are now clearer For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Apr 23rd 2022,After getting inflation so wrong can the Fed now get it right?,IT WAS A simple stunning admission “We have had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted” said Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve last month Many factors explain the latest burst in inflation with snarled supply chains tight job markets generous fiscal stimulus loose monetary policy and more recently the war in Ukraine all part of the fabric But one thread runs through them all Investors analysts and crucially central bankers believed that high inflation in America had been consigned to history a problem more for academic studies than for current policyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNo one now doubts that inflation is a problem for today Consumer prices rose by 85% in March compared with a year earlier a four-decade high Belatedly the Fed has swung into action As recently as mid-2021 most members of its rate-setting committee believed that it would not raise interest rates at all this year see chart 1 At its meeting in March however Fed officials concluded that they would raise rates by nearly two percentage points in 2022 setting America up for one of its steepest tightening cycles in a quarter of a century How did the Fed get it so wrong? And does its sharp shift mean that it is at last getting it right?Explanations for the Fed mistake fit into three related categories: a failure of imagination a technical trap and institutional inertia In failing to see how bad things might get the Fed was hardly alone When inflation perked up a year ago most analysts and investors pointed to dislocations from the pandemic With people avoiding crowded places demand for goods such as cars and computers had boomed just as companies were struggling to make them As covid-19 faded away so would inflationNot all economists were so optimistic Notable among them was Larry Summers a former treasury secretary In February 2021when prices were still quiescenthe warned that President Joe Biden $19trn covid-relief bill might “set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation” Others including Olivier Blanchard a former chief economist of the IMF and Jason Furman an economic adviser to President Barack Obama added their concerns “At a minimum the Fed should have been much more even-handed in assessing that inflation might come down but that it might also stay high” says Mr Furman Indeed as prices rose interest rates fell in real terms which only added fuel to inflationA common refrain of the Fed critics is that the central bank was caught fighting the last war The recovery from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 was long and drawn out with inflation staying subdued Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton an asset manager thinks this misled the Fed “The idea was that inflation expectations were so well-anchored that a free lunch was available You could have a massive expansion of fiscal and monetary policy and still no impact on inflation” she says This time though the economy was not emerging from a deep financial crisis Rather the pandemic was more akin to a natural disaster from which recoveries tend to be much swifterA more technical explanation for the Fed mistake was its new framework for monetary policy unveiled in August 2020 known as “flexible average inflation targeting” Boiled down the idea was to let the economy run hot to make up for colder periods so that inflation averages 2% over time Bill Dudley a former president of the New York Fed argues that this framework has merit but that its implementation was clumsy The Fed wanted to be certain that inflation would stay above 2% for a while and that the job market was in rude health before lifting rates “The flaw was putting yourself in a position where you tied your hands so you almost had to be late with tightening” says Mr DudleyEven for those more inclined to be forgiving there is concern about how long it took the Fed to alter its course “Committees have inertia” says Adam Posen president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank in Washington “Ideally central banks should be completely shameless about saying ‘oops we made a mistake We’ve got to fix it’ But they’re not” Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the Fed made it hard for itself with its open-ended asset-buying programme or quantitative easing QE The Fed was nervous about how to halt QE without upsetting markets By contrast the Bank of England had a fixed end point for its QE “Everyone expected it to end on a certain date unless there was big news in a different direction” Ms Forbes saysAt some level the Fed has now corrected its three mistakes It is alert to the reality of inflation; it has in effect shelved its average-inflation framework; and institutional momentum has moved towards tightening so that even its erstwhile doves sound relatively hawkish Alongside a steep path of rate increases the Fed is expected to start shrinking its balance-sheet next month “It is not clear that moving any faster would gain you more credibility or more inflation reduction But it is clear that it would massively increase the likelihood of recession” says Mr Posen As it stands the Fed has never before managed to reduce inflation from such lofty levels without inducing a downturn Mr Powell himself conceded last month that a soft landing would be hard to pull offEven so some still sense over-confidence The median forecast of the Fed rate-setting committee has been branded as “immaculate disinflation”: according to its projections in March inflation is expected to come down to 23% on the Fed preferred gauge in 2024 despite short-term interest rates reaching only 28% Put crudely this implies that real rates will be barely positive and yet inflation will somehow fizzle outMr Dudley says the next test for the Fed may come in 2023 Given the ebbing of pandemic distortions inflation may well tick down over the rest of this year That however will not get America back to an annual inflation rate of 2% Instead it may be closer to 4% with companies still struggling to hire workers in an overheated economy If the Fed lets up at that point in its tightening America could be primed for trouble warns Mr Dudley “Underlying inflationary pressures will gradually drift higher and the Fed will be forced to respond more aggressively later” he says “The risk for a hard landing goes up the more it procrastinates”Mr Furman is less worried thinking the Fed will go further with its tightening if inflation remains uncomfortably high next year “When reality is different from what they think they themselves will make the necessary changes” he says Still he would like the Fed to be clearer now that its tightening “has no preset stopping point” and will keep going as long as inflation is elevated After a year of erring on the side of optimism and getting it wrong it is an appeal for more humility For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 16th 2022,The complicated politics of crypto and web3,“IT’S VERY attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly” wrote Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin in an email in 2008 to Hal Finney a developer describing the appeal of the “e-cash” he planned to launch The attraction stemmed from bitcoin potential role as a currency free from verification by centralised third parties and from oversight by governments Bitcoin would instead be verified cryptographically and governed by its usersListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBitcoin doubtless appeals to those on the right At a conference in Miami on April 7th Peter Thiel the co-founder of PayPal a firm he once imagined as a young libertarian could supplant the world monetary system waxed poetic about bitcoin potential He views the technology as inherently political saying in 2020 that “if AI [artificial intelligence] is communist crypto is libertarian” AI represents the advance of centralised machines making top-down decisions; crypto requires many individuals and computers making decisions from the bottom upMr Thiel is not alone in thinking there is something inherently right-wing about crypto Marc Andreessen co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz a venture-capital firm agrees with the characterisation In 2021 he wrote that crypto could represent a “right-wing tech” that is both more decentralised and more comfortable with entrepreneurialism than the tech industryMr Andreessen is most animated by the opportunities stemming from “distributed consensus” Until now he argues collaborative online effort either adopted corporate norms from the real world or worked as open-source projects with no money involved By comparison crypto allows for new kinds of incentive systems where participants can be paid without a real-world company needing to exist Take Helium a decentralised wireless network for instance It encourages individuals to install “hot spots” in their homes for use by nearby internet-connected devices by compensating them in HNT a crypto token The more the hot spot is used the more tokens are paid outSuch architecture is commonly called “web3” a nod to its potential to be the next phase of the internet Chris Dixon of Andreessen describes the infrastructure as making it possible for organisations to be owned by token-holders who then vote on governance matters Modern tech firms are incentivised to build mammoth platforms that show users as many ads as they will bear By contrast developers and users of a web3 application could earn rewards for building and interacting with the platform In this world users would be able to vote on how Facebook or Twitter algorithms work Crucially they would also gather up their share of the profitsAt first glance the idea that these applications or projects can be built or contributed to by anyone is the stuff of freedom-loving libertarian dreams But the way projects themselves are being run has quite a lot in common with left-wing ideas Antonio García Martínez a former manager at Facebook and the author of “Chaos Monkeys” a book about Silicon Valley culture says that “you will never hear a venture capitalist sound more like a communist than when they are talking about web3” Blockchain-based enterprise might not be quite what Marx had in mind But the model behind it seems closer to the idea that the community should own the means of production distribution and exchange than modern capitalism doesThere is a comedy to venture capitalists talking like communitarian socialists notes Tomicah Tillemann of Haun Ventures a crypto fund As a former adviser to Joe Biden he is no libertarian Still a real shift is under way Virtually everyone agrees that the big-tech model is flawed he says Mr Thiel and his ilk loathe its de-platforming of right-wing voices; the left takes aim at its concentration of power and wealth Messrs Thiel Andreessen and Tillemann all see crypto as a serious threat to the status quoThe truth may be that web3 is simply nascent enough that people across the political spectrum see in it whatever they want If crypto really does make it possible for developers or users to build any kind of economic system then the applications that flourish will be the ones that work best Perhaps those will be libertarian Utopias where the Satoshis of the world retain their privacy But they could just as well be social-democratic metaverses with automatic wealth taxes and virtual paternalistic officialsRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Bonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

 Apr 16th 2022,What bigger military budgets mean for the economy,IN THE WAKE of the war in Ukraine military budgets around the world are about to get bigger This is most notable in Europe where the threat of Russian aggression looms largest Germany Italy and Norway among others have already decided to spend more on defence America and China the world two biggest military spenders are also ramping up their allocations Pressure on smaller countries to do likewise seems inevitable What are the economic consequences of this push? When governments spend more on soldiers and arms they have less available for other things A common assumption therefore is that extra spending on armies is harmful to growth and development But the relationship is not so straightforward In some cases bigger defence budgets may in fact yield substantial economic benefitsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat there is a trade-off between spending on the army and on say roads or hospitals is a lesson that students of economics internalise early on The classic model for illustrating the concept of opportunity costs is guns versus butter: the more you produce of one the less you can of the other In any given year that simple model holds true Governments have finite budgets which can only be pulled in so many different directionsIt is thus easy to see how spending on defence taken to an extreme could be corrosive for an economy If a government shortchanges the education system in order to buy shiny new weapons the long-run impact on productivity and ultimately growth would be baleful Some economists think America is nearing that danger zone The RAND Corporation an influential think-tank supported by the Air Force not exactly known as a peacenik outfit published a report in 2021 laying out two risks First when the government allocates money to defence at the expense of infrastructure that may undermine long-run growth prospects since America has a pressing need for better roads ports and more Second defence spending contributes to the public-debt load In both cases the analysts conclude anything that erodes America economic strength will ultimately hurt the armed forcesPerhaps there is something to the point that these trade-offs are damaging to the economy at America levels over the past decade its military budget averaged more than 4% of GDP second-highest in the OECD club of wealthy countries But a complication emerges when examining trends over time The OECD member that spends the most on defence at about 6% of GDP is Israel It also consistently boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the group By contrast Japan is one of the lowest military spenders as a share of GDP in the OECD and one of the slowest growers In fact it is almost impossible to discern a pattern in the data: there are also countries such as Ireland with military budgets similar to Japan and growth records similar to Israel A basic regression reveals no consistent relationship between GDP growth and military spending for the 38 countries in the OECDA sprawling body of research has come to a similar albeit more nuanced conclusion In a discussion paper at Monash University in 2014 Sefa Awaworyi Churchill and Siew Ling Yew examined 42 separate studies Effects are generally quite small but they found two distinct categories: military expenditure in poorer countries is often detrimental to growth whereas in wealthier countries it is more likely to be beneficial One possible reason they suggest is weaker governance in developing countries; a big military budget is a juicy target for corrupt officials Another possibility relates to the gun-versus-butter framework The potential returns on civilian investments from health care to education are so great in poor countries that military spending has a particularly high opportunity cost In rich countries with good schools and hospitals the opportunity costs ought to be lowerOne way in which defence spending might be said to boost the economy is as a jobs programme If the armed forces were a corporation they would be America largest employer with 2m workers counting active-duty personnel and civilians beating Walmart and Amazon That said it would be an eye-wateringly expensive jobs scheme running at nearly $400000 per employee a yearDefence spending may deliver better returns as an undeclared form of industrial policy In a paper last year Enrico Moretti of the University of California Berkeley and two colleagues looked at government funding for research and development R&D with a focus on defence spending in OECD countries On average they found that a 10% increase in government-financed R&D leads to a 5% increase in privately financed R&D in the targeted firm or industry Moreover there are knock-on benefits for productivity If France and Germany raised their defence spending to roughly the same level as in America Mr Moretti estimates that their productivity growth rates would be slightly higher as a resultDividends of deterrenceAn obvious objection is that the government could achieve the same results by supporting R&D in general without pumping money into the armed forces In an economic sense that may be true But there is a political constraintnamely how to marshal support for experimentation that may fail Public support for defence is less susceptible to mood swings Without having to worry about its next grant application the American military system has been free to churn out innovations from duct tape to the internet without which modern life would be scarcely imaginableImportant as it is to trace the impact of military spending on growth or innovation such exercises risk missing the wider context as demonstrated by Russia war in Ukraine A foundational element for any successful economy is peace and stability giving firms the confidence to invest and people the space to flourish Textbooks may talk of guns or butter But in a world unsettled by revanchist powers the truth is that it is both guns and butter A strong defence is regrettably a necessity for a strong economy Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:China has a celebrated history of policy experiments Apr 9thWill dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

 Apr 16th 2022,Xi Jinping bold plan for China next phase of innovation,THINGS ARE looking bright for Zhuzhou The city of 4m people in landlocked Hunan province has often caught the runoff of industrial business from the more populous provincial capital Changsha to its north In the 1990s it became a regional hub for chemicals and metals production But that caused horrible environmental destruction; more than 1000 polluters were eventually shut down with dire economic consequences Zhuzhou inland economy has remained behind that of coastal cities Over the past decade its moderate growth has been typical of the mid-tier cities that dot China interiorListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow however its officials talk as if it were a tech hub Hundreds of artificial-intelligence AI robotics and data companies have sprung up in the past year Local planning documents reflect the exuberance of a boomtown in the making something Zhuzhou could only watch from afar in the 1990s as eastern ports became richThe documents refer to “great changes not seen in 100 years” a phrase that has been used by Xi Jinping China president to signify the start of a new era He believes China is on the verge of a revolution in which dozens of cities will begin producing breakthroughs in robotics cloud computing and automation Zhuzhou officials also believe they are poised to reap the rewards of Mr Xi “common prosperity” campaigna plan to redistribute wealth from richer regions to poorer ones and from the dominant internet platforms to consumers and workersMr Xi strategy is best understood as a weighty bet that China is on track to become the world centre of innovation over the next decade A shift towards homegrown tech is altering the geographical layout of China manufacturing machine New investment and migration are being rerouted from rich coastal hubs to inland cities such as Zhuzhou A second feature is an unprecedented rise in the number of new tech companies The government is nurturing thousands of groups big and small in the fields of data science network security and robotics Mr Xi and his advisers are also taking firmer control over markets Their ability to direct capital flows is already evident in how private-equity groups invest in ChinaThis shift comes at a definitive moment The narrative that America and the West are in decline and that China is rising appears frequently in state media And yet China has not been more inward-looking since it was condemned internationally after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 The business hub of Shanghai a city of 25m people has been locked down as Mr Xi seeks to eradicate covid-19 His support for Russia during the war in Ukraine has raised the potential for more sanctions on Chinese firms These conditions seem only to strengthen his desire for self-relianceMr Xi is building an incubator state: an economy that relies heavily on government nourishment to create productivity gains with domestic research and technology In doing so he is also signalling a premature break with the technological convergence that has served China well since the 1980s when foreign companies began setting up factories using advanced technologies This tech was eventually transferred to local firms or reverse-engineered at little costThe payoff argues Raymond Yeung of ANZ a bank was the realisation of productive efficiencies One crucial feature of the convergence model was that it presented few risks China needed only to continue liberalising and foreign companies only to continue to bring in capital and high-tech gear to reap the rewardBut the era of convergence is drawing to a close China total-factor productivity growth languished at just above 1% per year between 2010 and 2019 Tech transfers are now far more restricted by America Mr Xi can surely imagine the sanctions devastating Russia being aimed at China The response has been to end reliance on foreign tech and to refocus the growth model on what can be created at homeHigh-stakes gambleRather like a venture-capital investor taking high-risk high-reward bets Mr Xi will shoulder more risk in this era His plan requires the creation of big globally competitive groups akin to Huawei a telecommunications giant “But they will have to develop lots of Huaweis” says Mr Yeung If the investments do not produce returns the plan will have saddled the economy with yet more debt and too little growthPast Chinese leaders have focused their reforms in coastal cities where manufactured goods could easily reach ports Shenzhen 700km south of Zhuzhou became emblematic of China rise as the factory of the world in the 1990s Some of that business crept westwards to cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing Mr Xi time in power at first focused on boosting consumption which also favoured the largest coastal cities On his watch Alibaba and Tencent based in the eastern and southern entrepôts of Hangzhou and Shenzhen respectively rose to prominence as engines for consumption and were often hailed as such by Party officialsThis has changed rapidly over the past two years Mr Xi is reorienting the economy back towards manufacturing The move away from consumer-internet tech or soft tech was made clear in the 14th five-year plan published in 2021 It emphasised instead rapid development in hard tech or areas such as AI semiconductors industrial software and big-data processing The new industrial policy does not require easy access to portsThe efforts could redraw China economic map An emphasis on manufacturing had pushed migrant workers not just to coastal towns but also to inland cities where new factories could be built cheaply says Chi Lo of BNP Paribas a bank The last great pulse of inland migration began in 2001 when China joined the WTO and lasted until 2013 when Mr Xi came to power and consumption became the focus for growth The past eight years witnessed a shift with migration out of inland centres to cities in the east Mr Lo believes China is near the start of another wave of inland migration that will power Mr Xi new industrial revolutionMigration is essential if the new tech firms are to be staffed A review of company-registration data by The Economist shows that firms dealing in big data AI the internet of things robotics cloud computing and clean energy are setting up at an unprecedented pace in China interior Many of the new hubs are capitals of poor provinces But many smaller cities too such as Zhuzhou are also experiencing explosive growth in tech firms see chartHefei in Anhui province one of China poorer regions is a city of about 9m It has reinvented itself in recent years as a tech hub with thousands of firms opening in a short period In 2021 alone more than 2500 companies claiming to develop basic AI software set up in the city up from just 370 in 2020 Thousands more say they offer related services The far northern rustbelt city of Shenyang welcomed more than 860 companies that say they are doing robotics research over the past two years up from a combined 170 in the four years before that Some 4400 groups claiming to be involved in the internet of things set up shop in the south-western city of Chengdu in 2021 four times the number in 2020The rapid growth in these cities is closely connected to local-government planning and the offer of generous tax and land incentives Indeed the figures should also come as a warning to planners that the tech boom they have induced is leading to potentially wasteful investments Take data-centre and cloud-computing businesses The pandemic created great demand for consumer-internet firms and in turn data services Local policies encouraged companies of all types to set them up or at least try Property developers needed only to convince local officials to sell them land and power cheaply in order to tap into the lucrative data-centre industry says Edison Lee of Jefferies an investment bankGuiyang a large city in the poor southwestern province of Guizhou witnessed an explosion in data-centre-company registrations in 2020 many with no experience in the area Some have even tried to move into cloud computing which requires more technological input than data centres The wave of innovation in AI robotics and climate tech is carrying with it many wannabes that will drain government funds not add to GDPSeveral investors have questioned where the talent needed to power this boom will come from The government has announced academic programmes to train people up But a shortfall seems clear The rerouting of migrants does not take into account that their skills have not kept up with Mr Xi industrial shift Almost 70% of the labour force has not had one day of high-school instruction notes Scott Rozelle of Stanford UniversityThe government needs more than a startup scene to make its plan work And so it is nurturing a new cohort of champions These are not the consumer-internet groups that dominated China digital economy Instead they are companies engaged in enterprise software industrial digitisation data security and state-owned cloud computing Few investors in Silicon Valley will have heard of Baosight Maxscend Sangfor Supcon or YoueData Many are listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen not New York and Hong Kong They are a mix of state and private firms but almost all are close to the government And they are working to upgrade China industrial infrastructure in order to usher in Mr Xi new revolutionBaosight is a state-owned industrial-software firm It builds the enterprise-resource-planning software and manufacturing-execution systems that are integrating and digitising industrial plants across China These systems aim to drive efficiency within the steel pharmaceuticals and chemicals industries Baosight recently completed work for a state steel group in what was considered the largest most complex integration project of its kind Its market capitalisation has risen three times over since 2018 to 62bn yuan $97bnSangfor Technologies a private network-security and data group based in Shenzhen is helping the government build advanced big-data platforms Supcon also privately controlled builds network ecosystems for state-owned firmsA small but growing number of international investors has cottoned on to these companies Their thinking could not be more different from the past generation of tech-watchers Companies such as Alibaba attracted funding as investors bet that only the private sector could provide the dizzying array of online shopping and financial services that would in turn support hefty valuations for a few big platformsSoft tech hard lineThat thesis has been dealt a heavy blow The government believes the consumer-internet craze widened inequality Companies’ market dominance allowed them to manipulate pricing while hoovering up unregulated personal data Their clout also dwarfed the influence the Party had over the digital economy These imbalances have been “rectified” as officials say by sweeping regulatory crackdownsThe state not only succeeded in knocking tech-market valuations by more than $2trn in the span of about a year It has pushed the giants into submission and decline Many executives such as Richard Liu of JDcom have stepped down Companies are laying off workers; few are pursuing capital-intensive acquisitionsFor the new champions to achieve scale they will need to be globally competitive and gain market share in developed economies Huawei was on this road before it was knocked back by America Mr Xi wants China to produce its own hard-tech companies in order to become more self-sufficient from the hostile West But even if this new phalanx of state-backed tech companies is less reliant on foreign inputs than Huawei it can still be barred from foreign markets denying it the business needed to grow to sufficient sizeHow China new boom is funded has become a vexing question for venture capitalists eager to find the next Alibaba but wary of running afoul of government policy Mr Xi is now six years into a reordering of capital and financial markets China 58trn-yuan shadow-banking market was first targeted in earnest in 2017 A three-year $450bn wave of speculative outbound investment driven by flamboyant tycoons was subdued the same year Meanwhile property developers were cut off from the supply of credit that financed a 20-year frenzyIn 2021 senior officials began referring to the enemy by name: a “disorderly expansion of capital” that has recklessly pursued high returns at the expense of the common good Hundreds of officials and businessmen have been taken down in recent years on corruption charges but only recently have some been accused of being “influenced by capital” Zhou Jiangyong a former Party secretary of Hangzhou the prosperous eastern city that is home to Alibaba is being investigated for such crimes He has also been linked by local media to companies affiliated with AlibabaMr Xi is already offering up a plan for an “orderly development of capital” He personally oversaw the launch of a new stock exchange in Beijing in 2021 that is focused on channelling investments to small tech groups State funds are raising ever more cash and investing in private tech firms The “little giants’‘ programme launched by the Ministry of Industry and Internet Technology is hand-picking thousands of firms that will be granted tax

 Apr 16th 2022,The latest industry to suffer labour shortages: investment banking,AFTER A DISMAL decade bankers of all stripes had reasons to be cheerful last year Eighteen months of soaring corporate dealmaking generated blockbuster fees for mergers and acquisitions M&A desks Their counterparts in debt advisory played midwife to a deluge of newly minted bonds Bouts of high volatility buoyed traders’ revenues Though the dealmaking frenzy may have cooled a little in 2022 lenders are licking their lips at the prospect of sharply rising interest ratesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet the industry faces a talent squeeze Bank bosses used the last earnings season of 2021 to gripe about the problem Deutsche Bank Christian Sewing was “very concerned” about a war for talent; Goldman Sachs David Solomon said it caused “wage inflation everywhere” The subject seemed likely to raise its head again as Wall Street banks reported their first-quarter earnings after we went to pressA survey of 267 financial-services employers conducted in November by Hays a London-based recruitment firm found that 83% had suffered from a skills shortage in the past year More than half attributed that to competition from rivals This is a sector more used to causing shortages than suffering from them sucking in would-be maths teachers and disaffected doctors Nor has its promise of riches dimmed: average pay at Goldman last year was $400000 Why the struggle to hire?One popular line of argument holds that banking is the victim of a generational shift Everyone from hiring managers to university careers services reports that young workers care less about salary and more about work-life balance Most of all they want to work for a company with a clear social purpose All of that puts the recruitment model for traditional financial firmshigh pay in return for gruelling hours and work with a social value that is not immediately obviousat riskThese apparent preferences are hard to square with the behaviour of younger applicants Darren Burns of Morgan McKinley another recruiter says they are becoming more hard-nosed in salary negotiations not less “Decent candidates will line up half a dozen offers when they used to only pursue one” he says They are also more aware of their market value As a result even back-office roles are having their salaries bid up One senior Wall Street banker puts it bluntly: “They say they care less about salary but they absolutely care if the bank across the street is paying more”Banking attractions then do not seem to have lost their appeal Instead the battle for talent is driven by three other factors Start with the scale of the demand for bankers’ work According to Refinitiv a data provider companies announced M&A deals worth $58trn in 2021 64% higher than the year before and easily beating the previous high in 2007 Initial public offerings had a record-breaking year too with newly listed firms raising $608bn And of the $10trn in American corporate bonds 42% was issued in the past two yearsAll that equates to an avalanche of work for investment bankers The industry staffing model meanwhile is ill-suited to spikes in demand “If the large banks aren’t able to pay their best people well they lose them all” explains one headhunter The only way to do that and remain profitable is to be ruthless about headcount running teams with “very little fat” in normal times When business balloons as it did in 2021 those lean teams very quickly end up working at full capacityat which point the only options are to poach people from elsewhere or to turn down business The result is a fierce zero-sum skirmish between banks for skilled staffAt the same time the list of other firms offering bankers eye-watering salaries has lengthened Private-equity funds have long piggybacked off the training offered by the big investment banks luring talent away with better pay and slightly gentler working hours Banks in America are particularly vulnerable with a supersized private-investment industry offering just as supersized compensation Blackstone one of the biggest such firms received 29000 applications for 100 junior-level jobs in 2021 In recent years these have been joined by a growing cohort of dealmakers going it alone and taking firms public via special-purpose acquisition companies M&A boutiques which advise on mergers without the full-service offering of an investment bank entice still more bankers away from bankingThird there has indeed been a shift in workers’ attitudesjust not one that results from them being unwilling to hack the hours of their predecessors Florian Pollner of McKinsey a consultancy describes how in conversations with human-resources bosses a theme that comes up time and again is younger workers’ more modular approach to their careers Instead of looking for jobs for life they seek out roles they can spend a few years in and then leave with broader optionsThat works in banks’ favour for recruiting junior staff: their graduate schemes are still seen as excellent preparation for a career But it also puts pressure on attrition rates in an industry already known for the mercenary outlook of its employeesThese forces are changing the way banks recruit and retain their staff Many have long tried to draw employees from a more diverse pool That task is now more urgent and goes beyond lines like race and gender Mr Pollner sees banks at all levels recruiting from a much broader range of universities than they used toand just as important trying to hire people with personalities “different to the stereotype of the average banker” Retention efforts have a darker side too: an investment manager at a London private-equity fund reports having hired juniors from two separate banks only to have both receive letters from their former employers suggesting they might have to repay bonuses in the end they did notThe net result within investment banking is likely to be a widening gap between the largest and most profitable banks chiefly American ones and “second-tier” firms including European banks The latter have long had to pay more and take greater risk to compensate for not having the prestige and huge domestic market of the Wall Street giants That has sometimes had dire consequences: Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have suffered such frequent losses from scandals and exposure to dubious clients that they have become the butt of industry jokesAs second-tier banks struggle to muster the financial firepower to recruit senior talent that problem will only worsen The fewer skilled staff they attract the less deal-flow they capture and the faster their investment banks must shrink In recent years many European banks have been forced to flee Wall Street or close their racier outfits altogether More of them may become casualties of the talent war raging at the cutting edge of capitalism For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

 Apr 9th 2022,The Federal Reserve prepares for quantitative tightening,QUANTITATIVE EASING or QE once an unconventional tool of monetary policy has become commonplace over the past decade During the pandemic alone the Federal Reserve bought a staggering $33trn in Treasuries and $13trn in mortgage-backed securities as it sought to keep borrowing costs low The reverse process quantitative tightening QT when central banks shrink their balance-sheets has been far rarer The Fed is the only central bank to have truly attempted it and it had to stop abruptly in 2019 because of market ructions So its plan for reducing its assetstrailed in the minutes of its meeting in March published on April 6thtakes it into relatively uncharted territoryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOfficials like to downplay the significance of QT When at the Fed helm Janet Yellen compared it to watching paint dry Jerome Powell her successor says it will operate in the background In truth it is akin to dismantling an auxiliary engine for the economy with only hazy knowledge of the consequencesAs Lael Brainard a member of the Fed board noted on April 5th this round of QT will be more aggressive than the Fed previous iteration With inflation racing ahead and the labour market tight the central bank wants to cool the economy quickly Coupled with interest-rate rises QT is likely to be a drag on growthSo far the Fed has reinvested the proceeds of maturing bonds in order to maintain its stock of assets The minutes suggest it is likely to shrink its balance-sheet not by making active sales but by letting some maturing bonds “roll off” without reinvestment The roll-off may start in May Come July all going well the Fed will raise the maximum roll-off to $95bn per month split between $60bn of Treasuries and $35bn of mortgage-backed bonds At full tilt the Fed could shrink its balance-sheet by more than $1trn over a 12-month period twice as fast as its first go at QT “Even if it done in a predictable way this is a big adjustment for markets” says Brian Sack of DE Shaw an investment firmMultiple rounds of bond-buying by central banks since the financial crisis of 2007-09 have yielded some understanding of how QE works It signals a commitment to ultra-low interest rates It suppresses long-term rates And it supports liquidity ensuring that markets operate smoothlyQT looks like QE in reverse Instead of creating central-bank reserves held by the private sector by purchasing bonds the central bank drains reserves by refraining from reinvesting as bonds mature The three channels through which QE works also operate in reverse First QT sends a signal that rate rises are coming Notably it was in early January when the Fed discussed a faster approach to QT than many had expected that market rates shot upThe second channel QT direct impact on yieldsinvolves heroic guesstimates Some analysts think the Fed will shrink its balance-sheet by $3trn over the next three years taking it to about 20% of GDP down from 36% now Mark Cabana of Bank of America reckons this could equate to anywhere between a quarter point and 125 percentage points of rate increasesa remarkably wide range Mr Powell has also noted the uncertainty about QT: “We have a much better sense frankly of how rate increases affect financial conditions”When the Fed raises interest rates it is raising overnight borrowing rates which then ripple along the yield curve With QT the main impact is on longer-term yields For some economists such as Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this means that QT could be more potent than rate rises since it would target hot segments of the credit market such as mortgages The Fed has said that it will stick with rate increasesthe devil it knowsas its main tool If however QT does hit longer yields it may need fewer rate rises to tame inflationThe final channel is liquidity As the Fed buys fewer bonds there may be fewer transactions overall Indeed a Bloomberg index that measures the ease of trading Treasuries recently worsened to levels last seen at the pandemic start That echoes uncomfortably with the past round of QT which culminated in a liquidity crunch in the overnight-borrowing market But the Fed is better prepared this time There is much more cash in the market to begin with And the Fed has set up an overnight-lending facility which should let banks get funds if needed “The risk of a spike in rates like we had in September 2019 is much much lower” says Bill Dudley former president of the New York FedYet new concerns will emerge The Fed mortgage bonds have long tenors so passive roll-offs would take decades The central bank may have to make active sales which it wants to avoid Another concern is the Fed $326bn in short-term Treasury bills Some observers think it will roll them off supercharging QT; others fear that would stoke volatility But the biggest worry is whether QT will work as intended

 Apr 9th 2022,China has a celebrated history of policy experiments,IN MAY 1919 John Dewey an American philosopher embarked on a lecture tour of China “We are going to see more of the dangerous daring side of life here” he predicted His celebration of learning by doing and social experimentation was enthusiastically received by the country daring reformers and dangerous revolutionaries At least one of his lectures was attended by a young schoolteacher called Mao Zedong “Everything through experimentation” Dewey declared on his tour Chairman Mao would later repeat the line as China rulerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the scattered bases occupied by China communists before 1949 experimentation was unavoidable points out Sebastian Heilmann in his book “Red Swan: How Unorthodox Policymaking Facilitated China's Rise” The communists lacked the manpower or administrative reach to impose uniform policies Instead they introduced new measures such as land reform in model villages or “experimental points” before spreading them across the “surface” of their territory The aim was to learn by doing without doing anything uncontainably calamitous These “model experiences” Mao wrote were “much closer to reality and richer than the decisions and directives issued by our leadership organs”A similar “point-to-surface” approach was embraced by China leaders after Mao Indeed the central government has initiated over 630 such experiments since 1980 according to a recent paper by Shaoda Wang of the University of Chicago and David Yang of Harvard University It has experimented with carbon trading fisheries insurance business licensing and fiscal devolution A report last month by China planning agency referred to pilot schemes covering everything from cross-border e-commerce and housing provident funds to green electricity and recyclable packagingThese trials are not mere formalities The results can go either way About 46% of experimental policies are never rolled out nationwide according to Messrs Wang and Yang An unsuccessful trial can nonetheless yield useful lessons for future reforms Failure as Mao once put it is the mother of success: “a fall into the pit” can yield “a gain in your wit”China has indeed gained a lot from using this method It is a “huge improvement” on a “counterfactual world” in which all central policies are implemented without any experimentation Mr Wang argues The point-to-surface technique is one reason why communist China has survived and advanced even as other socialist regimes have stagnated or collapsed according to Mr Heilmann Such unexpected outcomes are sometimes described as “black swans” In China case he argues red seems the more appropriate colourThis long and celebrated history notwithstanding China is surprisingly bad at policy experiments Its trials are not as clean as they could be skewing the conclusions its leaders draw One problem is their location According to China planning agency “sites should be fairly representative” But contrary to this sound advice 80% of experiments since the 1980s have taken place in localities that are richer than average according to Messrs Wang and Yang Another bias is fiscal When local authorities experiment with an area of policy such as education or agriculture they tend to spend 5% more money on that area than otherwise similar counties that are not taking part in the experimentExperiments can also be skewed by less measurable factors Some local officials for example simply put more effort into these pilot exercises than others This is particularly true of ambitious young cadres who have more scope for promotion because they are still far from retirement age To measure this extra effort Messrs Wang and Yang devise an ingenious proxy They compare the language employed by local governments in describing the experiment Leaders with more room for promotion differentiate their language from the boilerplate used by their upwardly immobile counterparts elsewhereExtra effort more spending and atypical prosperity can all skew the results of a policy experiment Some of these biases may be well known to seasoned policymakers in Beijing But if so national leaders do not act as if they are aware of them They tend to favour successful trials regardless of the true source of that success The more prosperous an experimental site the better the chance the policy will be adopted nationwide Such backing is also more likely if the host county just happens to enjoy a fiscal windfall during the trial period say because a fortuitous cut in interest rates raises land values The central government does not seem to disentangle the merits of an innovative policy from the idiosyncrasies of the places that pilot itA duck dressed up as a swanThis has national consequences When new policies are spread across the surface of the country the localities that most closely resemble the experimental “points” benefit the most judged by their subsequent economic growth Since experimental sites tend to be richer than average the policies that emerge from experimentation may “systematically favour” the richer parts of China Messrs Wang and Yang argue That is not an outcome that Mao or Dewey would have welcomed: inequity through experimentationHow can China reform this engine of reform moving its experiments closer to reality? Another striking calculation by the researchers suggests one useful place to start They point out that local officials are 22% more likely to be promoted if they take part in a successful experiment To improve this technique therefore China leaders will have to fix the politics that attend it In recent years under Xi Jinping experimentation has become “forced and feigned” according to Mr Heilmann Local administrators enjoy little “leeway and they are fearful of making policy and ideological mistakes along the way” There will be no gain in wit if local policymakers fear a fall into the pit Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Will dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

The shocking headlines come at you relentlessly But look out of the window and everything seems calm The only sound is the chirping of crickets You start to wonder said Hicks: where is all this bad stuff happening?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA lot of bad stuff is happening just now most notably a war in Europe There is also inflation and growing fears of recession Government bonds have just had their worst quarter for returns in ages The Treasury yield-curve has inverted: the gap between yields on ten- and two-year bonds recently turned negative an early warning of a downturn The Federal Reserve is growing more hawkish Yet stocks are surprisingly buoyant Even after a few days fairly deep in red ink this week the S&P 500 index of stocks is only 7% below its all-time high This might look like a foolish stockmarket failing to take its cue from a more realistic bond market But the truth is more complicatedThere are lots of plausible explanations for the resilience of stocks An evergreen one is that there is no good alternative to owning them Investors need to put money to work and American stocks are the least-worst option Bonds are a snare As long as inflation is expected to exceed interest rates they are a sure-fire way to lose purchasing power The yield on ten-year inflation-protected bonds is still negative even after the big repricing in bond markets The earnings yield on equities is comfortably higher than this real bond yield And stocks offer some protection against inflation in as much as corporate revenues are indexed to rising consumer pricesIn any event the risk of recession in America is not immediate The Fed has barely started to tighten monetary policy Even a rapid series of interest-rate increases will take time to slow the economy The negative spread between ten- and two-year yields is an early-warning signal not a blaring alarm On average recession hits more than a year after this part of the yield curve inverts In the meantime the equity market typically goes up Looked at in this light the message to take is to hold stocks for nowUnderlying all these rationalisations is a sense that equity investors do not quite believe the Fed will follow through on all the interest-rate increases the bond market is pricing in Perhaps that is why the Fed rate-setters are sounding more and more hawkish in public One strain of this belief gives the Fed too much credit: it says it can easily conquer inflation without crashing the economy Another strain gives it too little credit: this school doubts the Fed stomach to engineer a recession for the sake of price stability If the result of such qualms is that inflation lingers above the Fed 2% target for longer then so be it That would be a bigger problem for bond returns than for equitiesIt is possible to pick holes in all these arguments But it is not quite right to conclude that the stockmarket has failed to adjust to new and harsher realities The best-performing industries in the S&P 500 in the first quarter were those likely to be resilient to stagflation: energy utilities and consumer staples Meanwhile technology stocksflag-bearers of the “secular stagnation” era of low inflation and low interest rateshave had a brutal few months The violence of this sector rotation away from tech has caused remarkably few ripples in the overall stockmarket Nevertheless equity investors were mindful of the world outside their window The Bank of America global fund-manager survey suggests that investors reduced the weighting of technology stocks in their portfolios as far back as November notes Kevin Russell of UBS O’Connor the hedge-fund unit of the Swiss asset manager The stockmarket has been ahead of the bond market on the risks of inflation not behind it he arguesA big question is how far all financial markets are running behind the reality of inflation The phase during which asset prices adjust to the prospects of tighter Fed policy does not seem to have quite run its course And the pattern of the past two years is for one market phase to give way quickly to another Everything is moving faster these days But the relentlessness of scary financial headlines is not a confection of the 24-hour news cycle Instead it is a reflection of a super-charged business cycle which looks setmuch like Bill Hicksto burn brightly and die youngRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Can the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?

 Apr 9th 2022,Omicron is dealing a big blow to China economy,OMICRON MOVES fast That makes it difficult to containeven for China which tries to stomp promptly on any outbreak A cluster of infections in Shanghai for example has forced the government to impose a hurried lockdown for which it seems woefully unpreparedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe variant speed also makes China economic prospects unusually hard to track A lot can happen in the time between a data point release and its reference period The most recent hard numbers on China economy refer to January and February Those surprisingly good figures look dated even quaint For most of that time there was no war in Europe And new covid-19 cases in mainland China averaged fewer than 200 per day compared with the 23107 reported on April 7th Relying on official economic figures is like using a rear-view mirror to steer through a chicaneFor a more timely take on China economy some analysts are turning to less conventional indicators Baidu a search engine and mapping tool provides a daily mobility index for instance Over the week to April 3rd this was more than 48% below its level a year ago The index is best suited to tracking movement between cities says Ting Lu of Nomura a bank To gauge the hustle and bustle within cities he uses other indicators such as subway trips Over the week ending April 2nd the number of metro journeys in eight big cities was nearly 34% lower than a year ago In Shanghai where many subway lines are now closed the number of trips was down by 93% a worse drop than in early 2020The two numbers that worry Mr Lu most track distribution services In the week ending April 1st an index of express deliveries by courier companies was nearly 27% below its level at a similar point last year Over the same period an index of road freight fell by 128% The decline looks especially stark because the measure was rising briskly at the end of last yearUnconventional measures are all the more valuable in China because of doubts about the official data The strong figures for January and February for example are not only old but odd They suggest that investment in “fixed” assets like infrastructure manufacturing facilities and property grew by 122% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier But that is hard to square with double-digit declines in the output of steel and cement The recovery in property investment also looks peculiar alongside the fall in housing sales starts and land purchases When some local governments said that they were double-checking their figures at the behest of the National Bureau of Statistics NBS it became clear that the official statistics look odd even to the official statisticiansChina high-frequency indicators proved their worth in spring 2020 Economists were timid at first in cutting their growth forecasts No one knew exactly how the economy would react or what the NBS would be prepared to report Armed with evidence from high-frequency data forecasters were eventually brave enough to predict a GDP decline in the first quarter of 2020 Indeed it shrank by 68% according to even the official figuresThe timeliness of unconventional indicators makes them valuable in periods of flux Still “there are many traps” says Mr Lu Any short period can be distorted say by bad weather or holidays And annual growth rates can be skewed by past idiosyncrasies Moreover what does a dramatic weekly decline in road freight mean for quarterly GDP growth? It is impossible to say with any precision Many indicators also have only a short history As a PhD student Mr Lu was trained in econometrics “But with only one or two years of data if I used the kind of techniques I learned at school people would laugh at me”To help avoid some of the traps Mr Lu and his team watch “a bunch of numbers” “If seven or eight out of ten indicators are worsening then we can be confident that GDP growth is getting worse” he says Right now he thinks “something must be going very wrong” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterDig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub
 Apr 5th 2022,Are labour markets in the rich world too tight?,LAST MONTH Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve identified the most uncomfortable trade-off in economics “Today labour market” he said at a press conference is “tight to an unhealthy level” In most places and at most times a fall in unemployment or a rise in the number of people in work is welcome But labour markets can become too strained creating worker shortages that stop production and cause wages to spiral which can feed into overall inflationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Powell fears that America has crossed the threshold from good-tight to bad-tight one reason why the Fed is signalling that higher interest rates are on the way Increasingly though labour markets elsewhere in the rich world are also straining at the seamsAlmost nobody saw this coming When the pandemic struck in 2020 most economists believed that the rich world was in for a long spell of high unemployment similar to what happened after the financial crisis of 2007-09 In April 2020 America unemployment rate hit 147% Had joblessness declined at its post-financial-crisis pace the unemployment rate in March this year would have been over 13%In fact it is 36% And America by many standards is a laggard A rise in the number of Americans who have decided they do not want to work at all and who therefore do not count as unemployed means that the share of 15-to-64-year-olds with a job is slightly below its level at the end of 2019 see chart 1 In one-third of rich countries however this share is at an all-time high Even among the other two-thirds which includes America the median shortfall in the employment rate is just one percentage point It adds up to the quickest and broadest-based jobs boom in historyCanada and Germany are among the countries with record employment rates The same is true of France known for its high joblessness The working-age employment rate in Greece is three percentage points above its level in 2019 Across the OECD group of mostly rich countries there are about 20m more jobs than had been forecast in June 2020 The number of unemployed people chasing unfilled vacancies is the lowest it has been in decades see chart 2 Even as pricey energy and rising interest rates provoke concern about the economy there is little sign from “real-time” indicators that demand for labour is droppingWhy is the jobs recovery so fast? One reason is the nature of the shock that hit the economy in 2020 History shows that financial crunchestight monetary policy banking disasters and so oncause prolonged pain But economies usually recover speedily from “real” disruptions such as natural disasters wars and in this case a pandemic In 2005 Louisiana unemployment rate soared after Hurricane Katrina but quickly fell back though part of the adjustment came from people moving away After the second world war European labour markets rapidly absorbed soldiers returning from the front linesGovernment policy has also boosted jobs In 2020 countries including Australia Britain France and Germany launched or expanded job-protection or furlough schemes At the peak over a fifth of European workers remained technically employed even as they twiddled their thumbs When lockdowns lifted they could quickly return to their rolesrather than having to search and apply for work which takes time and thus keeps unemployment elevated America launched a modest job-protection scheme but its efforts were largely targeted at maintaining peoples’ incomes via stimulus cheques and topped-up unemployment benefitsStimulus schemes shored up families’ finances Many households also reined in spending in 2020 allowing them to accumulate huge savings The stockpile is now being spent on everything from consumer goods to housing raising demand for workers in areas such as online retail and property services including an extra 200000 estate agents in AmericaNice workers if you can get themWith labour demand so strong employers are having not only to increase the number of jobs but also to improve their quality Amazon exaggerated when last year it said it would try to be “Earth best employer” but many other companies are promising similar things whether by offering employees better in-office benefits such as tastier cafeteria food or better compensation packages free college tuition In 2021 venture investors put more than $12bn into global HR tech startups roughly 36 times the capital invested in them in 2020 according to PitchBook a data providerBad employers are having a tough time The share of Americans worried about poor job security is near a historical low In Britain the share of full-time workers on a “zero-hours contract” where there are no guaranteed hours soared after the financial crisis but is now falling Many of the gig-economy firms that grew in the early 2010s by relying on an army of underemployed workers are struggling to find staff Whether in London Paris or San Francisco hailing a ride is harder than it used to beThe best measure of labour-market tightness is pay which distils the relative bargaining power of workers and firms into a single number In some places the situation is clearly getting out of hand Wheeler County Nebraska is a heavily agricultural place a long way from anywhere In December unemployment fell to around 05% Jobs at a nearby Chipotle Mexican Grill pay $15-1650 an hour at least twice the federal minimum Some firms claim to be raising wages by 30% or moreSome countries still look decidedly un-Nebraskan Japanese wage growth is easing not accelerating In December the “special wage” which includes winter bonuses and typically makes up about half of total cash wages in that month fell by 1% year on year German wage growth is doing nothing special Canada is respectable but it is hard to make the case that things are out of controlOn average however labour markets across the rich world are clearly getting tighter America is plainly overheating In March average hourly earnings were 56% higher than a year earlier on the headline measure Another gauge suggests that the lowest-paid are seeing bigger rises see chart 3 Goldman Sachs a bank produces a wage tracker that corrects for various pandemic-related distortions It is more than 5% higher than a year ago the fastest rate of increase since the data began in the 1980s Almost all wage measures in America show unusually rapid growth by comparison manufacturing wages rose by an annual average of 41% in 1960-2019Before the pandemic underlying French wage growth was in the region of 1-2% a year Now it is close to 3% Italy looks similar On March 23rd Norway central bank noted that “wage inflation has been higher than projected and wage expectations have risen” Britain is particularly striking On Goldman measure underlying pay there is rising at an annual rate of about 5% Surveys of businesses suggest that even faster growth over the coming year cannot be ruled out Across the G10 large economies as a whole wages are rising by at least 4% a yearIs this sustainable? To most people wage growth of 4% hardly sounds malign But the arithmetic is inescapable At 4% wage growth labour productivity ie the value of what workers produce per hour must grow by at least 2% a year in order to be consistent with an inflation target of 2% Businesses would pass on half their extra hourly wage costs to customers in the form of higher prices but would absorb the other half since they would be selling more goods and services or producing them more efficientlyProductivity growth of 2% a year is not unachievable but it would be a lot stronger than it was before the pandemic Although productivity growth does seem faster than normal our analysis of data from OECD countries suggests that it falls short of 2% It may yet rise as companies reap the gains from their large investments in remote-working technologies and digitisation Hopes of higher productivity however must be weighed against fears of still-higher wage growthIf heady wage growth cannot be sustained how might it fall? One long-floated possibility in those countries with lagging overall employment rates is that people who have left the workforce return boosting the supply of labour Fear of covid-19 might eventually fade and child care might become easier to find easing worker shortages and causing wage growth to fallThis hope is receding however Although many Americans have returned to the workforce over the past six months wage growth has not slowedin fact it has accelerated The Economist calculates that in September there were nearly 19m “missing” workers aged 25 to 54 based on participation rates in January 2020 and adjusting for population growth By March 2022 this had fallen by more than half to about 750000or less than two months’ worth of job growth at the recent pace There are another 13m missing older workers but most are over 65 and likely to have retired permanently and the number of missing over-65s has been growingIt is likely therefore that in America and elsewhere labour markets will have to be cooled the old-fashioned way: by central banks raising interest rates making it a little more attractive to save than spend and choking off demand for labour The Fed has already increased rates by 025 percentage points and is expected to do so by a total of 25 points this year America may prove an example of what happens when policymakers respond to a labour market that has become dangerously hot For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,What can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?,ON FEBRUARY 22ND two days before Russia invaded Ukraine a German-flagged vessel left the Russian port of Primorsk loaded with 33000 tonnes of oil When it reached Tranmere a British oil terminal on March 3rd it received a frosty welcome Some dockers refused to unload the freight when they learnt where it had come from Similar boycotts have sprung up elsewhere Kayrros a data firm estimates that the volume of oil “on water” rose by nearly 13% in the fortnight after the invasion in large part as undelivered Russian cargo sought new takers The number of vessels returning to Russia also jumpedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMost of what has flowed out of Russia in recent weeks was bought and paid for before the war started Now less oil is leaving the country in the first place Worries about sanctions and bad publicity have prompted many buyers to pause purchases On March 24th the volume of Russian seaborne oil exports at 23m barrels per day bpd was nearly 2m below the level on March 1st reckons Kpler a data firm As those barrels fail to sell the price of Brent crude is nearing $115 Yet for the countries willing to risk opprobrium and jump through new logistical hoops Russian oil is beginning to look like a bargainThe partial embargo of Russia has echoes with the blockade of Iran by the West in the 2010s which led the Islamic Republic to put together an unrivalled playbook for smuggling oil In May 2018 America imposed “maximum pressure” sanctions with the aim of halting Iran oil exports altogether It almost succeeded: by October 2019 they had fallen to an average of 260000 bpd from 23m before the sanctions Since then however they have revived a little averaging 850000 bpd in the three months to February 2022Iran manages to sell oil through two channels The first is through authorised but restricted sales As it imposed its sanctions America granted a limited exemption to eight importing countries There is a big catch however: the sales have to be made in the buyers’ currency and either kept in escrow accounts at local banks or spent on a list of goods produced locally For Iran that is deeply frustrating In December it was forced to accept tea from Sri Lanka as payment for an oil debt valued at $251mTo circumvent the restrictions Iran smuggles vast quantities of oilits second channel for sales Iranian tankers sail to America foes such as Venezuela with their transponders turned off Some are repainted to hide their provenance Others transfer their cargo in the high seas often at night to ships sailing under a different flag Oil is also moved over land by smuggling gangs says Julia Friedlander a former intelligence official now at the Atlantic Council a think-tank in Washington Petroleum is bartered with China Turkey and the United Arab Emirates against gold pesticides and even housing projects in Tehran Traders in Dubai home to half a million Iranians blend crude from the Islamic Republic with other similar grades which they then rebrand as Kuwaiti oilRussia is unlikely to take a leaf out of Iran book mainly because for now it doesn’t need to The penalties imposed on Iran include secondary sanctions that threaten third-country banks dealing with it with huge fines That makes overtly buying its oil risky By contrast Russia faces a weaker embargo Only America which did not buy much to begin with has banned its oil On March 25th Germany said it would cut its purchases by half but it is unclear when that would start Sales transmitted through pipelines which are less conspicuous than shipments and represent about a fifth of Russia total exports of crude are still flowing Secondary sanctions have not been imposedInstead seaborne exports have cratered because Western buyers such as big energy firms fear a public backlash They also face logistical headaches as cautious banks cut credit ship owners struggle to obtain insurance and freight costs soar And each time sanctions are tweaked says Antonia Tzinova of Holland & Knight a law firm compliance staff must study hundreds of pages of legalese making many Russian deals hardly worth the hassle As a result Urals crude the grade pumped out by Russia is currently trading at a discount of around $31 a barrel One trader expects the gap to hit $40 within a week timeTwo big countries that have not joined in with the West sanctionsIndia and Chinasense a bargain to be had India is certainly acting on the opportunity Russian ship loadings headed for the subcontinent are expected to have risen to 230000 bpd in March up from nothing in the previous three months this excludes CPC a blend of mainly Kazakh and Russian crude Yet India is unlikely to buy much at least in the short term Nearly half its imports come from the Middle East and shipping from the Gulf is much cheaper than shipping from Russia Payment cannot be settled in dollars requiring India to experiment with a rouble-rupee mechanism see next storyAdi Imsirovic a former oil-trading boss of Gazprom now at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies does not see India buying more than 10m barrels a month This is small considering that Russia pool of unwanted oil is expected by the International Energy Agency an official forecaster to reach 3m bpd in AprilOnly China then can save Russia It imports a total of about 105m bpd 11% of the world daily production Mr Imsirovic thinks China could opportunistically increase its purchases to 12m bpd That could allow it to buy 60m from Russia in relatively short order It helps that China has lots of empty storageNone of this is happening yet Even for China transporting oil from Russia has become harder Whereas shipment from Russia to Europe usually takes three or four days to Asia it takes 40 Oil must be loaded onto bigger tankers which is slow and costly Chinese banks are loth to lendPayment is another problem Financiers in Hong Kong who have ample access to greenbacks have helped North Korea receive hard currency in the past But Russia energy deals would be far too large to hide in the city financial system says a trade lawyer And its main regulator would not turn a blind eye to such dealings lest they lead America to suspend Hong Kong ability to clear dollars locally a privilege central to its economyOne fix however is for Russia to use Chinese bank accounts within China to receive payment in yuan Those accounts could then be used to finance imports of essential goods avoiding the cross-border dimension of trade accountingChina may also be biding its time Even with the extra costs buying Russian oil would save lots of money And Chinese traders know a bargain when they see one: when the oil price neared single digits during the covid-induced downturn of 2020 they stocked up to the gills As Russia trading position weakens the Urals discount will go up So will China purchasesSuch a move will not be easily reversed Most refineries are configured to guzzle certain types of crude meaning switching from the high-sulphur Urals variety to say Saudi Arabia super light takes time and money That in turn suggests Russia push into Asia and Europe scramble for supplies could reshape the global market Much of North Sea oil usually goes east; more of it might now stay in Europe The continent will probably also buy more from West Africa and America and crank up its imports of sulphur-rich grades from the Gulf The rest of the worldAsia includedwill have to content itself with what Europe does not want Oil from the Tupi field in Brazil already trades at twice the premium to Brent than usualThe result of this more fragmented global oil-trading system will be a structurally higher price for importers Until the war petroleum generally flowed seamlessly from oilfields to the fuel tanks that needed it most Now says Ben Luckock of Trafigura a trading firm that finely tuned system has been disrupted For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Apr 2nd 2022,Under unprecedented sanctions how is the Russian economy faring?,IN RESPONSE TO Russia invasion of Ukraine the West launched an economic war America banned the sale of a wide range of goods to Russia; big companies pulled out by the dozen; and a number of countries together froze 60% of the central bank international reserves The idea was to send Russia economy into free fall punishing President Vladimir Putin for his aggression In the week after the invasion the rouble fell by more than a third against the dollar and the share prices of many Russian companies collapsedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIs the West strategy still going to plan? The chaos in Russian markets seems to have subsided Since its low in early March the rouble has jumped and is now approaching its pre-war level The main benchmark of Russian stocks plunged by a third but has since stabilised The government and most firms are keeping up with their payments on foreign-currency bonds A run on banks that saw nearly 3trn roubles $31bn withdrawn came to an end with Russians returning much of the cash to their accountsA battery of policies has helped stabilise the markets Some are orthodox The central bank has raised interest rates from 95% to 20% encouraging people to hold interest-bearing Russian assets Other policies are less conventional The government has decreed that exporters must convert 80% of their foreign-exchange proceeds into roubles Trading on the Moscow stock exchange has become to use the central bank euphemism “negotiated” Short-selling is banned and non-residents cannot offload stocks until April 1stThe real economy though is in some ways the mirror image of the financial one: healthier than it seems at first glance A weekly measure of consumer prices shows that they have risen by more than 5% since the beginning of March alone Many foreign firms have pulled out cutting the supply of goods while a weaker currency and sanctions have made imports more expensive But not everything is surging in price Vodka largely produced domestically costs only a bit more than it did before the war Petrol costs about the same And though it is early days there is little evidence yet of a big hit to economic activityAccording to an estimate based on internet-search data and produced by the OECD a rich-country think-tank Russia GDP in the week to March 26th was about 5% higher than the year before Other “real-time” data gathered by The Economist such as electricity consumption and railway loadings of goods are holding up A spending tracker produced by Sberbank Russia largest lender is slightly up year on year Part of this reflects people stockpiling goods before prices rise: spending on home appliances is especially strong But spending on services has fallen only a bit and remains far healthier than it was during much of the pandemicRussia seems sure to enter a recession this year But whether it ends up faring as badly as most economists predictthe wonks are pencilling in a GDP decline of 10-15%depends on three factors The first is whether ordinary Russians start worrying about the economy as the war drags on and reduce spendingas happened in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea The second is whether production eventually grinds to a halt as sanctions block firms’ access to imports from the West Russia aviation sector looks particularly vulnerable as does the car industry Yet many big businesses that started during Soviet times are used to operating without imports If any economy could come close to coping with being cut off from the world it would be RussiaThe third and most important factor relates to Russia fossil-fuel exports Despite the many sanctions imposed on it Russia is still selling about $10bn-worth of oil a month to foreign buyers equivalent to a quarter of its pre-war exports; revenues from the sale of natural gas and other petroleum products are still flowing in too This provides a valuable source of foreign currency with which it can buy some consumer goods and parts from neutral or friendly countries Unless that changes the Russian economy may continue to defy the worst predictions For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,The White House wants to close a tax loophole used by the ultra-rich,MOST AMERICANS want the government to impose higher taxes on the ultra-rich Every few months or so Democratic lawmakers unveil plans for doing just that only to stumble well before enacting them It is not just that the wealthy can afford powerful lobbyists The nature of their fortunes also makes them an elusive target for tax authorities A new proposal by the Biden administration may offer a partial solution provided it can overcome political and legal hurdlesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea contained in President Joe Biden new budget proposal on March 28th is that Americans worth more than $100m would pay a minimum tax of 20% on all their income including controversially the appreciation of their investments If an ultra-rich American makes a paper gain of say $10m on his stock portfolio in a year he would face a liability of $2mThe goal is to close a gaping loophole Wealthy Americans must pay capital-gains taxes of at least 20% when they sell assets But when assets are inherited the price at the time of the transfer forms the new basis for calculating capital gains In this way the ultra-rich can shrink their tax bills: they owe nothing on unsold assets while alive and their heirs then benefit from the “stepped-up basis” for capital gains Economists in the Biden administration have calculated that the 400 wealthiest American families pay an average federal income-tax rate of just 8% far below the rates paid by most in the middle classA simple way to close this loophole would be to recognise all capital gains upon inheritance Indeed that was Mr Biden preference in legislation last year But opponents tarred it as a “death tax” that would bankrupt family farms Although that charge was unfairalmost all farms would have been below the tax thresholdthe Democrats dropped the ideaThe Biden administration dubs the new proposal a “billionaire minimum income tax” Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Centre a think-tank calls this an ingenious rebranding of the stepped-up basis idea “It would operate like a pre-payment” he says Taxes owed at death would be reduced by those paid previouslyThe White House reckons the new tax would bring in $360bn over the next decade impressive for a levy that hits the wealthiest 001% of households That however reflects a windfall for the state when it collects on decades of gains for the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk To pay the tax they may need to sell down stakes in their firms potentially remaking their ownership structures The government would cushion the blow by breaking payments into instalments spread over nine years at first and later five years Once established the revenues would be slimmer “The $360bn estimate makes it look more promising than it really is in the long run” says Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tankThere are two immediate obstacles As with every idea from the Biden White House the political question is whether Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema two moderate Democratic senators support it They have for different reasons opposed previous tax increases Then there are the courts The constitution limits the federal government to taxing incomes not wealth The White House would argue that accrued capital gains are a form of income but its proposal would face legal challengesEven if Mr Biden were to succeed in shepherding the tax into law another concern would emerge The levy would be complex especially for assets that do not trade in public markets Lawyers would devise new structures to shelter wealth “Their pencils are being sharpened even as we speak” says Joel Slemrod an economist at the University of Michigan For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,Can the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?,FIGHTING INFLATION gets harder the longer it is put offand the Federal Reserve has waited quite a while For most of 2021 the central bank said that it had the tools to slow price rises but saw no need to put them to use Now investors are coming to terms with the fact that the Fed will have to deploy them at scale Since March 1st the three-year Treasury yield has risen by more than a percentage point the biggest absolute change since yields collapsed in January 2008 during the global financial crisisListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe move reflects the emergence of expectations that the Fed will increase interest rates by another two percentage points this year having already raised them by a quarter of a point on March 16th The impact has been felt worldwide On March 28th the Bank of Japan promised to buy Japanese government debt in unlimited quantities over four days in order to defend its cap on the ten-year government-bond yield The yield on ten-year German bunds which turned positive only in January now stands at over 06% even as soaring energy prices darken the growth outlookThe most important question for bond investors in America is whether the higher interest rates that are arriving hard and fast can bring about a fabled “soft landing” in which the heat is taken out of the economy without provoking a recession Past experience suggests that this will be difficult; tightening has often preceded downturns Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has pointed to successful soft landings in 1964 1984 and 1993 But those comparisons do not account for the difficulty of the present situation In none of those cases did the Fed let inflation rise as far as it has todayThe central bank latest projections are rosy portraying what its critics have dubbed an “immaculate disinflation”: three years of steadily falling inflation despite GDP growth remaining above its long-run trend and both the unemployment rate and the Fed policy rate remaining unusually low Mr Powell may have given up calling inflation “transitory” but these forecasts make sense only if inflation goes away of its own accordIt seems likelier that the central bank will have to squeeze inflation out of the economy Noting that there is no precedent for doing so gracefully Bill Dudley a former head of the New York Fed wrote in a Bloomberg column on March 29th that a recession was now inevitable The r-word is also in the air because yields on some short-term bonds have risen above those on longer-term bonds Such a yield-curve “inversion” suggests that investors expect interest rates to be cut eventually as the economy weakensAn inverted yield curve is often regarded as a sign that markets think the central bank is making a mistake The uncomfortable truth however is that a recession and a mistake are not the same thing if causing a downturn is the only way to restore price stability In the 1980s Paul Volcker Fed vanquished inflation by inducing recessions that pushed the unemployment rate to 108% Nobody accuses it of having done so inadvertently; rather it chose to pay the high price of disinflation That is not a position in which today central bankers want to be; they talk as much about their duty to support jobs and growth as they do about ensuring stable pricesThe good news for Mr Powell is that for all the chatter about the yield curve investors remain mostly on his side Most economists put the neutral level of interest rates at which monetary policy is pressing on neither the accelerator nor the brake at around 2-25% Both the Fed and the bond market expect the policy rate to overshoot that level only slightly Rates a notch or two above neutral can hardly be compared with Volcker tightening The market expects immaculacy too believing that modestly tight money will be enough to control inflationThe recent predictive record of both central bankers and bond markets has been poor however Just a year ago the Fed message was that it was not even “talking about talking about” tightening monetary policy and investors expected consumer prices to rise by just 27% over the following year If they are caught out again the Fed could find that meeting its inflation target demands that it induce a recession The yield curve would then invert more steeplyIn that scenario America would pay a dear price for the glacial pace of action in 2021 which was justified ironically by the supposed dangers of sudden moves It has left the central bank the world economy and asset prices on more perilous groundRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The parallels between the nickel-trading fiasco and the LIBOR scandal Mar 26thCan foreign-currency reserves be sanction-proofed?

 Apr 2nd 2022,Will dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?,IN THE WAKE of an invasion that drew international condemnation Russian officials panicked that their dollar-denominated assets within America reach were at risk of abrupt confiscation sending them scrambling for alternatives The invasion in question did not take place in 2022 or even 2014 but in 1956 when Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary The event is often regarded as one of the factors that helped kick-start the eurodollar marketa network of dollar-denominated deposits held outside America and usually beyond the direct reach of its banking regulatorsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe irony is that the desire to keep dollars outside America only reinforced the greenback heft As of September banks based outside the country reported around $17trn in dollar liabilities twice as much as the equivalent for all the other currencies in the world combined Although eurodollar deposits are beyond Uncle Sam direct control America can still block a target access to the dollar system by making transacting with them illegal as its latest measures against Russia have doneThis fresh outbreak of financial conflict has raised the question of whether the dollar dominance has been tarnished and whether a multipolar currency system will rise instead with the Chinese yuan playing a bigger role To understand what the future might look like it is worth considering how the dollar role has evolved over the past two decades Its supremacy reflects more than the fact that America economy is large and its government powerful The liquidity flexibility and the reliability of the system have helped too and are likely to help sustain its global role In the few areas where the dollar has lost ground the characteristics that made it king are still being sought out by holders and usersand do not favour the yuanEurodollar deposits illustrate the greenback role as a global store of value But that is not the only thing that makes the dollar a truly international currency Its role as a unit of account in the invoicing of the majority of global trade may be its most overwhelming area of dominance According to research published by the IMF in 2020 over half of non-American and non-EU exports are denominated in dollars In Asian emerging markets and Latin America the share rises to roughly 75% and almost 100% respectively Barring a modest increase in euro invoicing by some European countries that are not part of the currency union these figures have changed little in the past two decadesAnother pillar of the dollar dominance is its role in cross-border payments as a medium of exchange A lack of natural liquidity for smaller currency pairs means that it often acts as a vehicle currency A Uruguayan importer might pay a Bangladeshi exporter by changing her peso into dollars and changing those dollars into taka rather than converting the currencies directlySo far there has been little shift away from the greenback: in February only one transaction in every five registered by the SWIFT messaging system did not have a dollar leg a figure that has barely changed over the past half-decade But a drift away is not impossible Smaller currency pairs could become more liquid reducing the need for an intermediary Eswar Prasad of Cornell University argues convincingly that alternative payment networks like China Cross-Border Interbank Payment System might undermine the greenback role He also suggests that greater use of digital currencies will eventually reduce the need for the dollar Those developed by central banks in particular could facilitate a direct link between national payment systemsPerhaps the best example in global finance of an area in which the dollar is genuinely and measurably losing ground is central banks’ foreign-exchange reserves Research published in March by Barry Eichengreen an economic historian at the University of California Berkeley shows how the dollar presence in central-bank reserves has declined Its share slipped from 71% of global reserves in 1999 to 59% in 2021 The phenomenon is widespread across a variety of central banks and cannot be explained away by movements in exchange ratesThe findings reveal something compelling about the dollar new competitors The greenback lost share has largely translated into a bigger share for what Mr Eichengreen calls “non-traditional” reserve currencies The yuan makes up only a quarter of this group share in global reserves The Australian and Canadian dollars by comparison account for 43% of it And the currencies of Denmark Norway South Korea and Sweden make up another 23% The things that unite those disparate smaller currencies are clear: all are floating and issued by countries with relatively or completely open capital accounts and governed by reliable political systems The yuan by contrast ticks none of those boxes “Every reserve currency in history has been a leading democracy with checks and balances” says Mr EichengreenBattle royalThough the discussion of whether the dollar might be supplanted by the yuan captures the zeitgeist of great-power competition the reality is more prosaic Capital markets in countries with predictable legal systems and convertible currencies have deepened and many offer better risk-adjusted returns than Treasuries That has allowed reserve managers to diversify without compromising on the tenets that make reserve currencies dependableMr Eichengreen research also speaks to a plain truth with a broader application: pure economic heft is not nearly enough to build an international currency system Even where the dollar dominance looks most like it is being chipped away the appetite for the yuan to take even a modest share of its place looks limited Whether the greenback retains its paramount role in the international monetary system or not the holders and users of global currencies will continue to prize liquidity flexibility and reliability Not every currency can provide them Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Have economists led the world environmental policies astray?

 Apr 2nd 2022,America gas frackers limber up to save Europe,“NO PAYMENT NO gas” growled a Russian government spokesman on March 29th Angered by the West economic sanctions President Vladimir Putin ordered that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas in roubles a demand that ministers from the G7 group of countries refused Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that Mr Putin would turn off the taps On March 30th Germany began bracing for the worst taking its first step towards gas rationing By the end of the day however the German government said it had received assurances that European firms would not have to make payments in roublesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven if an embargo has been averted the latest confrontation surely strengthens Europe desire to relax Mr Putin grip on the economy The EU has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year by two-thirds by the end of 2022 Ursula von der Leyen the head of the European Commission dreams that the EU can “get rid” of Russian imports entirely within a few years Can America one of the world largest natural-gas exporters help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas LNG from Americawhich it dubbed “molecules of freedom”the proposal was ridiculed Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a “groundbreaking” plan to help end the EU reliance on Russian gas It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG for Europe this year equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021 It also promises to “ensure additional EU market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year equivalent to 22bn cubic metres as prices soared on the continent America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use” reckons Rystad a research firm meaning that “there is no additional LNG to be exported” in the short term Jack Fusco boss of Cheniere a big American energy company confirms that his firm is “maxed out” It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals to change thatThere are also questions about whether the EU has the infrastructure to cope with the imports Receiving cargoes of LNG and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification Europe has spare capacity but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the EU where an embargo would hit hardest Germany which has no LNG terminals has vowed to build two but that will take several years Some European countries talk of acquiring floating LNG terminals which can be set up more quicklybut there is a severe global shortage of themLook to the longer term though and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise That is because the EU appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas The intent had been to promote competition but as last winter rocketing gas prices revealed it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock As a top American LNG exporter explains Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured “fantastic” long-term pricing insteadNow the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts “to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure” That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required boosting transatlantic trade Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie a consultancy reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe extra demand could be in the region of $35bnDiversification away from Russia in the long term then may be possible But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps considering he profits handsomely from high prices Energy Intelligence an industry publisher reckons Gazprom earned $205bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020 But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money

The growing number of millennials entering their buying years will keep momentum going and flexible work could continue to make cheaper areas more attractive The question is what happens to affordability Interest rates in many places are going up: the Federal Reserve expects to raise rates six more times this year That could cool demand and increase mortgage-servicing costs Rising interest rates in the 1980s for instance depressed housing markets just as baby-boomers reached their peak buying years The difference now though is that rates are low by historical standards and expected to rise only graduallySevere constraints on housing supply however may mean that affordability remains strained Shortages of labour and materials will make it harder for builders to put new homes on the market Record-low inventory and fierce bidding wars could mean fewer homes to choose from For some millennials the dream of home ownership may still prove out of reach For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

the IEA reckons that the market size of such green metals would increase almost seven-fold by 2030 And much like fossil-fuel reserves these commodities are distributed unevenly see chart 1 Some countries have none at all Others are blessed with vast depositsThe metals rush will not be as big as the oil-and-gas boom that toppled King Coal after the second world war But there are some echoes with the past Between 1940 and 1970 the share of hydrocarbons in the energy supply of rich countries rose from 26% to nearly 70% Once-marginal economies in the Middle East were transformed into uber-rich petrostates Between 1970 and 1980 the GDP per person of Qatar and Saudi Arabia grew 12- and 18-fold respectively Bedouin villages became boom towns; fishing dhows gave way to super tankers and luxury yachtsThis time the transition will bring windfalls to countries we dub the “green-commodity superpowers” We calculate that this club many of which are poor economies and autocracies could pocket more than $12trn in annual revenue from energy-related metals by 2040With the opportunity however come risks As the troubled mining projects in Russia show important investments can become victims of local conditions and geopolitics Huge rents could corrode domestic markets and political institutions; autocrats enriched by electrodollars could make mischief beyond their borders Saad Rahim of Trafigura a trading firm says the shift to clean fuels is “less an energy transition than a commodity transition” It will be a turbulent oneThe green boom is not just another “supercycle” as prolonged periods of high commodity prices are known The last such cycle early this century was fuelled by rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in China The combined real GDP of Brazil and Russia two resource-rich economies grew by two-thirds between 2000 and 2014 But the rally was largely driven by China alone When the country leaders decided it should build fewer factories and flats the commodity giants suffered The green transition by contrast stems from the decisions of many governments not one And decarbonising the world is likely to be the job of decadesAnother big difference lies in the materials in demand China splurge burned through heaps of coal iron and steel The green boom centres on non-ferrous metals that are more niche Their combined annual revenues today at $600bn is equivalent to only a fifth of that of the bulk materials that China favoured There may be more explosive growth to comeTo understand which commodity producers stand to win and lose from a green transition we construct a simple scenario for the use of ten “energy-linked” commodities in 2040 assuming that global warming by 2100 stays below 2°C Based on data from a range of industry sources we project demand and revenue for three fossil fuels oil gas coal and seven metals aluminium cobalt copper lithium nickel silver and zinc that are critical to building an electricity economy We assume that prices remain at today elevated levels prompting miners to exploit untapped deposits And we assume that a producer market share in 2040 is in line with its share of known reservesOur findings suggest the world will be less reliant on energy-related resources in 2040 than it is todaylargely because wind and sunshine the sources of the future are free Total spending on our basket of ten commodities falls to 34% of global GDP from 58% in 2021 Spending on fossil fuels relative to world GDP falls by half and would shrink further were it not for gas The revenue from green metals remains smaller but rises from 05% to 07% of GDP It nearly triples in absolute termsThe number of big producers of energy-linked commodities falls over time: 48 stand to pocket sales equivalent to more than 5% of their GDP down from 58 in 2021 see chart 2 More than half of total spending goes towards autocraciesYou can group producers into three buckets based on the expected change in their revenues from the ten energy-linked commodities between now and 2040 The first comprises the winnersthe green superpowers These electrostates include some rich democracies Australia has troves of every metal included in our sample Chile is home to 42% of the world lithium reserves and a quarter of its copper deposits much of them in the Atacama desert pictured above Others are autocracies Congo has 46% of global cobalt reserves and produces 70% of the world output today China is home to aluminium copper and lithium Poorer democracies in Asia and Latin America may also hit the jackpot Indonesia sits on mountains of nickel Peru holds nearly a quarter of the world silverThe second bucket comprises countries with revenues that stay flat or fall a little It includes the low-cost members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC including Iran Iraq and Saudi Arabiaand Russia Although oil revenue shrinks their share of it expands from 45% today to 57% in 2040 Other countries such as America Brazil and Canada lose fossil-fuel earnings but are able to tap vast mineral depositsHigher-cost petrostates lose the most Many oil-rich nations in north Africa Algeria Egypt sub-Saharan Africa Angola Nigeria and Europe Britain Norway see their revenues shrivel Small states like South Sudan Timor Leste and Trinidad have theirs hit hard The pain does not spare some Gulf states: the proceeds captured by Bahrain and Qatar for instance decline by a fifth or moreWhat might prevent the new commodity superpowers emerging?

 Mar 26th 2022,Three big uncertainties cloud the oil market,ALMOST A MONTH after Russia invasion of Ukraine sent the oil price surging turbulence in one of the world most crucial commodities markets shows little sign of coming to an end The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil surged to $121 on March 23rd as storm damage halted exports from a Russian pipeline Over the past fortnight it has whipsawed from a peak of $128 to as low as $98 The pandemic-related chaos of 2020 aside the OVX index of oil-market volatility has rarely been higher in the past decade than it has been this monthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe swings reflect the interplay between the geopolitical and economic forces buffeting the world today from war to rising interest rates and covid-19 Even beyond the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine there are three big sources of uncertainty for the oil market The first is what the members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC do as the West sanctions bite and Russian production is shunned America has banned imports of Russian oil; even in countries that have not taken that step prospective buyers are struggling to transact with the Russian financial intermediaries that have been cut off from the plumbing of global finance as a result of sanctions and may fear fresh sanctions to comeOn March 16th the International Energy Agency an official forecaster said that international markets could face a shortfall of 3m barrels of oil per day from April as a consequence The world consumed about 98m barrels a day last year The disruption in what was once a fluid global market is best illustrated by the gap between the prices of the Brent benchmark and Urals oil On January 31st it stood at about 60 cents per barrel By March 23rd it was around $30This leaves a great deal of power in the hands of the two countries that are most able to offset a chunk of the Russian shortfall: Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates So far both have resisted pleas to raise output substantially At a meeting in early March OPEC and its allies including Russia merely confirmed existing plans to raise overall output by 400000 barrels per day Their next gathering at the end of this month will be watched closely Even small shifts in public pronouncements have the potential to set off swings in the oil priceThe second seam of uncertainty relates to the capacity of American shale-oil production to meet the supply shortfall During the first fracking boom which lasted from around 2010 to 2015 American output surged causing the oil price to slump and weakening OPEC‘s hand But conditions in the American economy have changed dramatically since leaving analysts and industry insiders doubtful that shale can rise to the challengeFor a start financing conditions are less encouraging than they were during the boom in 2010-15 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times this year and next: two-year Treasury yields are just above 2% compared with the sub-1% levels that persisted during most of the past boom Another constraint on production comes from America tight labour market Just over 128000 people were employed in oil-and-gas extraction in February down from more than 200000 at the height of the fracking boom in late 2014 With the headline unemployment rate at 38% and employers struggling to fill vacancies already finding several tens of thousands of workers to move across the country will be no mean featThe industry attitudes have also shifted Both American producers and their potential creditors are now far more cautious about borrowing Banks and asset managers are bound by stricter environmental standards That is one factor driving costs higher In the first quarter of 2022 energy-exploration and production firms reported the steepest increase in lease-operating expenses ie the recurring costs of operating wells in at least six years according to a survey by the Dallas Fed Drillers themselves having struggled to make consistent profits in the past are far keener on capital discipline this time tooThe third component of the volatility in the oil price is to do with demand China “zero-covid” strategy is being tested to an extreme degree The country has recorded its highest numbers of cases since the pandemic began and big cities are facing rolling lockdowns again Platts Analytics a commodities-research house suggests that the restrictions could cut oil demand by 650000 barrels per day in March roughly equivalent to Venezuela oil outputEven before the lockdowns began there were signs of a deceleration in China economy particularly in the property sector Any sign that the slowdown in the world biggest importer of energy is becoming broad-based would mean more tumult for commoditiesThe machinations of OPEC the shale calculus in America and the health of the Chinese economy: any one of these sources of uncertainty would usually be sufficient to generate price swings Together they make a flammable mix For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterEditor's note 21st March 2022: This piece was updated to reflect a change in oil prices

 Mar 26th 2022,Have economists led the world environmental policies astray?,IF THE WORLD economy fails to decarbonise it will not be because of the cost The gross investment needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 can seem enormous: a cumulative $275trn according to the McKinsey Global Institute a think-tank attached to the consultancy But over a period of decades the world would have had to replace its cars gas boilers and power plants anyway So the additional spending needed to go green is in fact much smaller: $25trn Spread that over many years and compare it to global GDP and it looks significant but manageable peaking at 14% between 2026 and 2035 And that is without counting the returns on the investment British officials reckon that three-quarters of the total cost of the transition to net zero will be offset by benefits such as more efficient transport and that the state may need to spend only 04% of GDP a year over three decadesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe challenge of getting to net zero therefore is not primarily budgetary but structural: how do you design politically viable policies to ensure the transition actually happens? That is the question Eric Lonergan an economist and fund manager and Corinne Sawers a climate consultant take on in their new book “Supercharge Me: Net Zero Faster”The authors are not kind to economists who typically want to put a price on emissions and then let markets do the work Economists have the authors allege skipped a chapter in the textbooks They have focused on externalities the damage done to society when carbon is emitted But they do not think about the elasticity of demandthe extent to which prices change behaviourCarbon prices do not alter people choices much when there are too few substitutes for dirty goods or when those substitutes are too expensive High fuel taxes for example tend to provoke a political backlash against environmentalismthink of France gilets jaunesbut do not much alter transport emissions Britain has had one of the highest levels of fuel duty in the rich world in recent decades note Mr Lonergan and Ms Sawers but drivers’ take-up of electric vehicles has been unremarkableThe authors argue that getting people to make the big leaps needed to decarbonise such as buying an electric car or installing a domestic heat pump instead requires “extreme positive incentives for change” EPICs They laud Norway for exempting electric vehicles from road tax cutting their parking charges in half and giving them access to bus lanes More than 90% of cars sold in the country are now electric They propose big mortgage discounts for homeowners who retrofit their properties And they want the state to generously subsidise lending to green projects while exempting them from a range of taxes “To succeed we have to fight on all fronts” they writeTheir assault on carbon pricing is not entirely without merit The theoretical attraction of the policy is that it leads the market to discover the cheapest ways to cut emissions where behaviour is easily changed while allowing other parts of the economy to choose to pay the toll Economists in Barack Obama White House were among those who puzzled over the “social cost of carbon”the optimal carbon price that would deter some emissions but not those that were sufficiently beneficial to the economy to offset their effect on global temperaturesBut in a world of fixed-date net-zero targets this sort of logic loses power Such goals concern all pollution not just that which is easily abated Saying there is a maximum permissible amount of global warming of 15-2°C above pre-industrial levelsthe targets in the Paris agreementis like saying there is a point at which the social cost of carbon is infinite In this world policymakers are not setting a carbon price to distinguish between emissions They are trying to change behaviour It may be that EPICs or investments in green technology are a more politically viable route to doing so than raising the carbon price to whatever level is necessary to extinguish inelastic demand for fossil fuelsYet the authors push their criticism of carbon prices too far They praise Britain adoption of wind power but fail to note the role that its “carbon price floor” a minimum levy bolted on to the EU emissions-trading scheme played in the transition They lament the “complexity” of carbon taxation while also advocating a fiddly green corporate tax And they fail to notice the flawed political economy of their kitchen-sink approach For example they call on central banks to provide the green subsidies they desire To whom would the central bank be accountable? And once the principle that monetary policy does not allocate capital is conceded what is to stop other demands being made on it? Carbon pricing is simple and transparent by comparisonCasting the net wideMoreover there is an important role for carbon pricing even in a net-zero world One area of technological possibility concerns the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The potential for “direct air capture” or a well-governed market for carbon offsets such as planting trees restores the logic of using carbon prices to discriminate between emissions as well as simply deterring them If such advances materialise the carbon price might eventually be the exact cost of extracting carbon from the atmosphere with the market determining the size of the gross flows on either side of the net-zero ledgerEven if Mr Lonergan and Ms Sawers are right that some EPICs are needed to make the journey to net zero politically easier then economists’ long-standing arguments for carbon pricing still have considerable merit And the world has been slowly coming round: in 2021 more than 20% of greenhouse-gas emissions were covered by a carbon-pricing scheme up from about 5% a decade ago The path to net zero will involve more than set-it-and-forget-it carbon pricing But economists’ favourite climate-change policy remains an essential one Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The disturbing new relevance of theories of nuclear deterrence Mar 19thHow oil shocks have become less shocking Mar 12thVladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling Mar 5thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 19th 2022,Governments are proposing windfall taxes on energy firms,ON MARCH 8th the day the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil spiked above $127 the European Commission unveiled its grand plan to fight stratospheric living costs Claiming that the “crisis situation” warranted exceptional measures it recommended that member states levy a one-off tax on electricity-generating firms The revenues raised could then be used to keep households’ bills down The next day Elizabeth Warren a senator from Massachusetts tweeted that she and other legislators were working on a tax on the “war-fuelled profits” accruing to American oil majors The proposal is now making its way through the House of RepresentativesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPoliticians have reached for such “windfall” taxes before Bulgaria Italy Romania and Spain have imposed them on power generators in recent months as benchmark energy prices have risen America began taxing oil producers in 1980 hoping to cash in on profits that were expected to be made after prices were deregulated Britain new Labour government taxed utilities in 1997 after the Conservative government had sold them off cheaplyThe levies are understandably tempting for the taxman Big windfalls mean big receipts The usual worry with a tax is that it might change companies’ behaviour say by encouraging them to lower investment in order to bring down future tax bills But the event causing the windfall is meant to be a one-off unconnected to investment They are “extremely efficient ways to raise revenue” says Helen Miller of the Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank in London At least in theoryBritain tax probably fitted the ideal better than most It had a clear rationale: that excess gains had come from the underpricing of shares when firms were privatised Post-privatisation profits were multiplied by a price-to-earnings ratio; a 23% tax was levied on what was left over once public proceeds from privatisation were subtracted Even then however the tax failed to target the beneficiaries of excess gains British Telecom the first utility to be privatised had listed in 1984 Many early punters had come and gone leaving shareholders in 1997 bearing the burdenLevies elsewhere have faced other hurdles In 2006 Mongolia introduced a 68% charge on profits from copper and gold sales hoping to cash in on a new mine during a commodity-price boom Instead investors withheld funds for the project until regulators agreed to drop the tax America tax did distort firms’ behaviour by some estimates reducing oil production between 1980 and 1986 by up to 48%The European Commission plan has its flaws It does not explain why the current situation warrants a one-off tax adding uncertainty about when such levies might be used again Furthermore the energy industry buys and sells power using long-term contracts making the link between today prices and tomorrow profits fuzzy And prices can fall as quickly as they rise By March 16th for instance the oil price was back to about $100 a barrelRecent experiments offer scant grounds for optimism Romania Italy and Spain are targeting renewable-power generators which have not experienced the same increase in costs as generators that use fossil fuels Richard Howard of Aurora Energy a consultancy says that this raises the “risk premium” of investing in renewablesexactly what legislators want to avoid Peter Styles of the European Federation of Energy Traders a trade body notes that Spain scheme stops green-energy generators accruing excess profits to begin with which will distort the way prices are set in the marketTheir momentum across Europe also creates a fiscal opening that may be hard to close The commission recommends that all windfall taxes should be wound down by the end of June But Spain has already extended its clawbacks once And Italy measures will last until December Correction: An earlier version of this article said that America's tax on oil producers was implemented in 1986 In fact it began in 1980 SorryFor more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Mar 19th 2022,The disturbing new relevance of theories of nuclear deterrence,SIXTY YEARS ago a dispute over the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba pushed Washington and Moscow perilously close to all-out war The crisis provided history most extreme example yet of nuclear brinkmanship situations in which governments repeatedly escalate a very dangerous situation in an attempt to get their way It also demonstrated the extraordinary value of the work of Thomas Schelling an economist then at Harvard University who used the relatively new tools of game theory to analyse the strategy of war The war in Ukraine has made Schelling work for which he shared the economics Nobel prize in 2005 more relevant than everListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGame theory came into its own in the 1940s and 1950s thanks to the efforts of scholars like John von Neumann and John Nash who used mathematics to analyse the strategies available to participants in various sorts of formal interactions Schelling used game theory as a prism through which to better understand war He considered conflict as an outcome of a strategic showdown between rational decision-makers who weighed up the costs and benefits of their choices If a would-be attacker expects to gain more from aggression than any cost his adversary can impose on him then he is likely to go through with the aggressive actFor a government hoping to deter an aggressor the effectiveness of its deterrence strategy thus depends in part on the size of the retaliatory costs it can inflict on its attacker But this is not an exact science Both sides may have incomplete information about the relative costs they can expect to bear When Vladimir Putin Russia president was preparing his invasion of Ukraine for example Western democracies threatened to impose stiff sanctions Just how tough the sanctions could be was not necessarily knowable to either side beforehand because the details needed to be negotiated with alliesThe credibility of retaliatory threats matters as well; both sides of a potential conflict may issue grave threats but if they ring hollow they may be ignored The threat of stiff sanctions by Western democraciesclearly a powerful tool in hindsightmight well have been weakened by doubts that governments were prepared to expose their citizens to soaring oil and gas prices Governments deploy a range of tools to bolster the credibility of their threats An American promise to defend an ally may be strengthened by the placement of American troops within the ally borders in harm way for instance; an American president would presumably find it more difficult to back down in the face of an attack that claimed American lives Schelling for his part noted that credibility can sometimes be enhanced by taking costly actions or limiting your own options A general promise to fight to the bitter end if an enemy does not withdraw becomes more credible if he burns the bridges that provide his own avenue of retreatThe problem of credibility becomes far more complicated in a showdown between nuclear-armed powers which both have sufficient weaponry to retaliate against any first strike with a devastating attack of their own If the first use of nuclear weapons is all but assured to bring ruin on one own country as well then efforts to use the threat of nuclear attack to extract concessions are likelier to fail Wars may nonetheless occur The invasion of Ukraine could be seen as an example of the stability-instability paradox: because the threat of a nuclear war is too terrible to contemplate smaller or proxy conflicts become “safer” because rival superpowers feel confident that neither side will allow the fight to escalate too much Some scholars reckon this helps to account for the many smaller wars that occurred during the cold warAnd yet the cold war also threatened to turn hot at times as in 1962 Schelling helped explain why He noted that the threat of a nuclear attack could be made credible even in the context of mutually assured destruction if some element of that threat was left to chance As a showdown between nuclear powers becomes more intense Schelling observed the risk that unexpected and perhaps undesired developments cause the situation to spiral out of control rises When nuclear forces are on high alert for instance false alarms become far more dangerous The upper hand in such a situation is thus maintained by the side that is more willing to tolerate this heightened risk of all-out nuclear warThis is the essence of brinkmanship It is not merely a matter of ratcheting up the tension in the hope of outbluffing the other side It is also a test of resolvewhere resolve is defined as a willingness to bear the risk of a catastrophe Mr Putin move to increase the readiness of his nuclear forces may represent an attempt to demonstrate such resolve over and above the message sent by the invasion itself President Joe Biden refusal to escalate in kind could be seen as an acknowledgment of the conspicuous fact that an autocrat embroiled in a pointless war has less to lose than the rich democracy to which Mr Biden is accountableThe only winning moveIt could be however that Mr Biden had something else in mind In his Nobel lecture Schelling wondered at the fact that nuclear weapons had not been used over the 60 years that had elapsed since the end of the second world war While he chalked up the absence of nuclear use between superpowers to deterrence he reckoned that in other wars and confrontations restraint was best understood as resulting from a taboo: a social convention that stayed belligerents’ hands when they might otherwise have deemed it strategically sensible to deploy nuclear weaponsRussia aggression has shattered another taboo against territorial aggrandisement through violence And though the governments of the West feel compelled to respond to limit the damage that has caused they are no doubt also keen to restore the old conventionto demonstrate that the world has moved beyond an age where the mighty take by force whatever they want Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How oil shocks have become less shocking Mar 12thVladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling Mar 5thHow to avoid a fatal backlash against globalisation Feb 26thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis
 Mar 19th 2022,Sanctions-dodgers hoping to use crypto to evade detection are likely to be disappointed,TO THEIR CHAMPIONS cryptocurrencies are supposed to be a libertarian Utopia Because tokens are created and moved by loose decentralised networks of individual computers based in dozens of countries cross-border transactions can be quick and in theory are free from control by intermediaries such as banks which can be regulated by national governments Critics of crypto-finance have long looked askance at the same system To statists it represents the tyranny of techno-anarchyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia invasion of Ukraine and the West subsequent sanctions on Russian banks companies and elites appears to turn on its head the debate about whom crypto helps and hurts Though politicians and regulators in America and Europe at first feared that people and entities hit with sanctions would use cryptocurrencies to dodge the restrictions little evidence of such activity has materialised Instead crypto institutions appear to be under the thumb of governments too And there has been a huge surge in crypto donations to help the government in UkraineCrypto decentralised network is supposed to be supranational and its users are meant to be anonymous This makes it seem like a useful tool for sanctions-dodging Certainly there is evidence that Russians have been buying more crypto But this may stem from a desire to hold an asset that is not plunging in value The rouble has tumbled by about 25% against the dollar since February 23rd whereas bitcoin has risen against the greenback For oligarchs looking to dodge sanctions though crypto has three main flawsThe first is that the infrastructure such as large exchanges does not really exist in Russia “Had the Russians wanted to use blockchain infrastructure for sanctions evasion they would have had to have taken a very different regulatory approach” says Tomicah Tillemann a former staffer for President Joe Biden who now advises Katie Haun a crypto-focused venture capitalist “Russia along with a number of other authoritarian societies has been pretty hostile to digital assets” Thus Russians’ ability to convert significant amounts of wealth into crypto is limitedThe second flaw is that it is not possible to buy most everyday items or financial assets with crypto which means that a sanctions-dodger must at some point leave the crypto-sphere “Ultimately what they really need to do is get access to some form of fiat currency which becomes more challenging” said Christopher Wray the head of the FBI in a US Senate hearing on the Russian invasion on March 10th That requires interacting with a crypto-exchangeThough early iterations of some exchanges resisted the need to implement “know your customer” KYC anti-money-laundering measures many have acquiesced as they have become regulated institutions Some are publicly listed Most have a presence in America and Europe Binance the largest exchange implemented a KYC policy in 2021 requiring those using it to identify themselves to the firmThe message from regulators to exchanges has been unanimous America Treasury has stressed that its sanctions apply “whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency” a message reinforced by an executive order on digital currency from Mr Biden on March 9th The White House has also issued a statement with the leaders of other G7 countries and the EU vowing to “impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth” The crypto industry has rushed to accommodate these requests Coinbase another large exchange has frozen 25000 Russian accounts Binance has said it will freeze the assets of people who have been targeted with sanctionsThe third problem is that moving money around in crypto is not as private as is widely thought Government sleuths have invested time and energy in trying to link supposedly anonymous wallets with real people with some success And as blockchain transactions are public once identified it is easy to trace the history of funds In December the FBI managed to seize $36bn-worth of crypto-assets related to a theft from an exchange in 2016Crypto may turn out to be far more useful to those looking to move in the open rather than in the shadows On February 26th the official Ukrainian Twitter account published digital-wallet addresses through which it is accepting bitcoin ether and other tokens Donations quickly flooded in “Crypto really helped during the first few days because we were able to cover some immediate needs” says Alex Bornyakov Ukraine deputy minister for digital transformation Nearly $100m-worth of tokens has since been donated to those and other wallets set up by private initiativesGetting money to war zones is notoriously hard In 2008 Mr Tillemann visited Tbilisi in Georgia with Mr Biden then a senator in the middle of Russia invasion of the country “It became very obvious that we were going to have real challenges getting in resources” he says Donors were forced to ship pallets of $100 bills into war zones in Iraq and AfghanistanMoving money out of war zones to buy supplies can be just as difficult In the chaos of the war it became increasingly difficult to pay in dollars or euros especially abroad “So we needed a tool to quickly perform those transactions And crypto was our first choice” says Mr Bornyakov Although most suppliers did not operate in crypto they agreed to accept it he says Ukraine has spent some $30m on things like bulletproof vests night-vision goggles and medicines Around a fifth of that was spent directly in cryptoThe war has made it clear that there are serious uses for crypto But it is now policed seriously

 Mar 19th 2022,A nickel-trading fiasco raises three big questions,THE TRADING of commodities is an arcane activity that makes it into the public eye only at times of extreme hubris That is when names like the Hunt brothers who tried to corner the silver market in 1980 and Hamanaka Yasuo or “Mr Copper” who in 1996 produced huge losses for Sumitomo a Japanese trading house became household ones Xiang Guangda a Chinese tycoon known as “Big Shot” vaulted into the news this month by taking a position on nickel that went badly wrong The result has been one of the biggest tremors in the 145-year history of the London Metal Exchange LME It has also brought China which is keen to exert more power over the trading of commodities face to face with free markets gone madListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the cloistered world of the LME some facts about the affair are clear One is that nickel prices already hot before Russia invasion of Ukraine surged after the West imposed sanctions on Russia Another is that Mr Xiang firm Tsingshan had exposure to short positions on the LME of about 180000 tonnes of nickel which were supposed to benefit if prices went down They didn’t as a short-covering scramble for nickel briefly pushed prices above $100000 a tonne on March 8th putting Tsingshan potential losses into the billions of dollars At that point the LME suspended nickel trading cancelling all trades that took place overnight When the suspension was lifted on March 16th a sharp drop in nickel prices forced the LME to suspend trading again adding to the chaosThree big questions remain How important is Tsingshan role in the debacle? Did its troubles provoke interference from China? And has the LME bungled its response? All will be the subject of scrutinyIn media reports Tsingshan has the lead role in the drama There is debate about whether its short-selling represented the normal activity of one of the world largest nickel producers hedging its output or a speculator making a rash bet What appears clear is that the nickel it produces is not the type of metallic nickel that is traded on the LME meaning there was a mismatch between its shorts and longs As its losses increased its brokers forced it to provide more cash or “margin” The size of its position meant that they also faced big margin calls making it as much their problem as Tsingshan On March 15th Tsingshan said it had reached a standstill agreement with its creditors until it reduces its positions in an orderly wayIn the market rumours abound that China may have influenced the LME activities partly because Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing HKEX owns the exchange and also because Tsingshan is strategically important to the country because its nickel goes into electric-vehicle batteries The LME denies receiving pressure from HKEX It granted extra time on March 7th to CCBI Global a Chinese broker for Tsingshan that is a member of the LME to raise funds from its state-owned parent China Construction Bank to cover margin calls That may have been a prudent thing to do It knew the wealthy bank could provide the funds Some traders wonder whether it would have been as tolerant with a non-Chinese entity In the aftermath Chinese authorities are said to have fought hard to stop Tsingshan nickel assets falling into the hands of non-Chinese speculatorsThe most intense scrutiny may fall on the LME itself specifically the timing of its decision to suspend nickel trading and the cancelling of overnight trades that were rumoured to be in the billions of dollars It said it halted trading in the early hours of March 8th when it reckoned the nickel market had become disorderly It added that its decision to cancel that day trades was because the big price moves had created a systemic risk to the market raising concerns of multiple defaults by member-brokers struggling to meet margin callsThat latter decision is the biggest bone of contention Critics say it favoured those with short positions such as physical producers and their banks over those with long positions that could be sold at a big profit They ask why it stepped in to protect brokers when the LME has a default fund that its members can get access to in times of trouble “The decision to erase the trades…will undermine long-term confidence in the LME” says Yao Hua Ooi of AQR an asset manager that had trades cancelled on March 8th “If you want the AQRs of this world [in the market] you cannot intervene when they make money and it hurts your brokers” He said the firm was exploring all options against the LMEThe LME has since set daily limits on price moves which were exceeded on March 16th when it briefly reopened nickel trading That is another sign of intervention by an exchange that used to pride itself on its free-market nature Its owner in Hong Kong with China looking over its shoulder would no doubt approve 
 Mar 19th 2022,Can foreign-currency reserves be sanction-proofed?,CRYPTO INVESTORS sometimes say they have been “rugged” when the developers of a coin vanish along with the capital that has been allocated to it pulling the rug out from under them Foreign-exchange reserve managers might never have expected to recognise the feeling But almost as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine American and European authorities froze the assets of the Central Bank of Russia As others followed the country first line of financial defence was obliterated According to the Russian government $300bn of its $630bn in reserves are now unusableListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe managers of the $137trn in global foreign-exchange reserves are a conservative breed They care about liquidity and safety above all else largely to the exclusion of profits Much of their thinking was shaped by the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 when currencies collapsed in the face of huge capital outflows The lesson learned was that reserves needed to be plentiful and liquidWatching a big chunk of Russia reserves being made functionally useless is likely to be just as formative even for those who face no immediate prospect of a terminal rift with the world financial superpowers That is particularly true for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE the agency in charge of China $34trn in reserves India and Saudi Arabia with $632bn and $441bn in reserves respectively may also be paying close attentionBarry Eichengreen an economic historian has described the choice of the composition of foreign-exchange reserves as being guided by either a “Mercury” or a “Mars” principle The Mercurial approach bases reserves on commercial links; the currencies being held are largely determined by their usefulness for trade and finance A Martian strategy bases the composition more on factors like security and geopolitical alliancesMars seems to be in the ascendant Central banks are bound to take into account which countries will and will not replicate sanctions against them In 2020 Guan Tao a former SAFE official now at Bank of China International laid out a range of ways that China could guard against the risk of sanctions In extremis he suggested that the dollar could stop being used as the anchor currency for foreign-exchange management and be replaced by a basket of currenciesEven that option which might have sounded extreme a month ago now falls short of what a Martian central bank would need given the degree of co-operation with American sanctions There are few if any jurisdictions with large liquid capital markets denominated in currencies that are useful in an emergency but which do not pose a risk from a sanctions perspective Some worried central banks might start increasing their holdings of yuan assets which currently make up less than 3% of the global total But that is no solution for China itselfWhy not go back to basics? Gold the original reserve asset is a large liquid market outside any one jurisdiction control Researchers at Citigroup a bank estimate that most of the reserves that Russia can currently marshal are in gold and the Chinese yuan Yet the West sanctions are so expansive that they prohibit many potential buyers from purchasing the assets Russia has accumulated over the years Even a would-be counterparty in a neutral or friendly country will think twice about transacting with a central bank under sanctions if it risks their own access to the financial plumbing of the dollar systemThere has been more adventurous speculation too Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse a bank has suggested that China sell Treasuries in order to lease ships and buy up Russian commodities arguing that the global monetary system is shifting from one backed by government bonds to one that is backed by commodities Bold as the forecast is it is also emblematic of the few conventional options available to reserve managersAnd that lack of good solutions points to another drastic approach: that countries limit their use of reserves for their financial defence altogether Various tools of autarky such as tighter capital controls could become more attractive Governments also typically rely on reserves as the last guarantee that they can service foreign-currency debts But if that guarantee is no longer absolute then they are less likely to be comfortable issuing dollar- and euro-denominated bonds at all Private companies may be prodded to de-dollarise too If you don’t invest in the first place you won’t be ruggedRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Iran flourishing stockmarket reflects its resilient economy Mar 12thInvestors are terrible at forecasting wars Mar 5thThe many virtues of the yen the rich world cheapest currency Feb 26thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 19th 2022,Globalisation and autocracy are locked together For how much longer?,THE WORLD’S supply chains have taken a knock yet again Russia invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973 and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home The West has issued sanctions against Russia depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologiesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09 Brexit President Donald Trump and the pandemic For years measures of global integration have gone south Between 2008 and 2019 world trade relative to global GDP fell by about five percentage points Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019 Immigration is lower too and not just because of border closuresThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies Such confrontation happened during the cold war too But this time autocracies are bigger richer and more technologically sophisticated Their share in global output trade and innovation has risen and they are key links in many supply chains Attempts to drift apart therefore will bring new consequences and costs for the world economyAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost In 1960 America Britain Canada France Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports Autocracies by contrast were economically unimportant on the world stage The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics Average GDP per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares But in economic terms there was no contestTheir economies were also largely unintegrated One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the USSR and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another The exceptions in east-west tradea bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974were few A study published by the IMF days before the Soviet Union fell said that “foreign direct investment in the USSR has been minimal to date”The communist bloc played by its own rules Soviet external economic activity largely took place within COMECON a group of sympathetic countries China and the USSR barely traded with each other from the late 1950s having fallen out Trade in COMECON took place not via money-for-stuff but in the form of a peculiar system of barteroil for manufactured goods sayagreed by governmentsFrom the late 1970s onwards autocratic regimes began to open up In part this was the result of an ideological change first apparent in China The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge “Unless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades China would remain poor weak and vulnerable” wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018 describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping the leader who spearheaded China opening up in the 1980s A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991The West on the whole welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation believing that it could be a force for good and for large profits By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards as well as foster democracy and freedom A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one the argument wentIn the 1990s globalisation took off Trade boomed Annual global flows of foreign direct investment FDI including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories rose by a factor of six In 1990 Russia first McDonald opened in Moscow; KFC set up shop a few years later Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125Living standards certainly went up The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990 Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average ItalianThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered however Our World in Data a research organisation puts countries into four groups ranging from most to least free: “liberal democracies” such as America and Japan; more flawed “electoral democracies” such as Poland and Sri Lanka; “electoral autocracies” such as Turkey and Hungary; and “closed autocracies” such as China and Vietnam where citizens have no real choice over their leaderClassifying political regimes is not an exact science and involves making assumptions and judgments Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019 for instance which some other sources do not agree with Nonetheless it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democraciesThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010 But democracy has retrenched since Most of the 19bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise such as in Turkey where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office see chart 1Using data from the World Bank the IMF and elsewhere we divide the global economy into two We estimate that today the autocratic world ie closed and electoral autocracies accounts for over 30% of global GDP more than double its share at the end of the cold war Its share of global exports has soared over that period The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989 Now it represents 30% see chart 2China is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms with a dollar GDP roughly two-thirds of America making up over half of our group of autocracies But others such as Turkey the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 yearsAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways Democracies invested $12trn Autocracies received more FDI than democracies between 2018 and 2020 And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60% China dominates patenting but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculationsMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist China for instance opened its domestic markets where it suited it but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war Vietnam which has been ruled by a single party for decades for instance has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gasWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies’ goods imports come from other political regimes The codependency in some markets is clear Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs The rest must come from somewhere else Half of the coffee that fills Europeans’ cups comes from places where people have weak political rights And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earthsIntegration goes far beyond trade American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies a rise of 90% in the past decade their total foreign employment has increased by a third Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world total stock of inward FDI Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in “free” currencies like the dollar and the euroBroken dreamThis intimacy is now under threat as a third darker period comes into view Even before the war in Ukraine powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policyThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods whether they would actually do so is another matter Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment including industrial espionage have also risenAutocracies have their own worries One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders weakening autocratic rule Deng himself identified the dilemma: “If you open the window for fresh air you have to expect some flies to blow in”Another bigger worry relates to power Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions This was clear from an early stage In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square The next year America placed Cuba El Salvador Jordan Kenya Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia first in 2014 and then again today bring the message home still more forcefullyAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling In 2014 America banned Huawei a Chinese tech firm from bidding on American government contracts In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were “unfair trade practices” including the theft of intellectual property FDI flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year down from nearly $30bn five years agoRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other Countries are signing smaller regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-relianceBegin with regional trade deals the number of which is booming In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries mostly non-democracies In that year the ASEAN group of South-East Asian countries became China biggest trading partner replacing the EU In Africa meanwhile most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade AreaCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer The CoRe Partnership an agreement between America and Japan launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech The US-EU Trade and Technology Council the pointed ambition of which is to promote “the spread of democratic market-oriented values” is working on climate change and strengthening supply chainsAutocracies are also forming their own blocs The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020 even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan rather than dollars Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020Large countries in particular meanwhile are also turning inward A big focus of President Joe Biden administration for instance is “supply-chain resilience” which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production China turn in 2020 towards a “dual circulation” strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers It wants to release its rivals’ grip on “chokehold” industries such as chipmaking equipment which it fears could be used to strangle its rise India too has turned towards self-relianceMany of these efforts could come at a price Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests rather than banding together History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America gross national product More recently many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump tariffs Brexit has slowed growth and investment in BritainRussia attempt at self-reliance by pursuing import substitution on a large scale building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy Sanctions by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight The economy was struggling even before the war and has since gone off a cliff Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the countryThe risk though is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration rather than more is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Mar 19th 2022,The inflationary consequences of Russia war will spread,LAST SUMMER amid mounting alarm about inflation in America economic advisers in the White House penned a blog post in which they examined historical parallels Although the press was full of comparisons with oil shocks in the 1970s they wrote that a nearer relative was the dislocation after the second world war when supply shortages interacted with pent-up demand It was a well-reasoned argument But the surge in commodity prices over the past month in the wake of Russia invasion of Ukraine gives rise to an unsettling question: is the global economy now seeing a 1970s-style price shock on top of a late-1940s-style supply crunch?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo be sure no serious economist expects inflation in the rich world to reach the giddy double-digit heights of those episodes On March 16th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 kicking off a tightening cycle that it expects to continue well into next year Moreover the retreat in oil markets in recent days could offer reliefNevertheless surging prices for everything from wheat to nickel threaten to add to inflation And rolling lockdowns in parts of China could exacerbate strains on global supply chains Consumer-price inflation in America already stood at a 40-year high in February at 79% year on year; the rate in the euro area meanwhile exceeded 5%Investors are still far from persuaded that central bankers are on top of the problem The most striking evidence is the inflation expectations that can be found in fixed-income markets in America ICE a financial firm distils a few different numbers including yields on inflation-protected bonds and interest-rate swaps into short-term and long-term indices for gauging expectations In late January the expected rate of inflation over the next year was 35% On March 15th it stood at 54% Expectations in the euro area have seen similar if slightly steeper trends The one-year inflation swap rate rose to 59% on March 8th see chart 2Markets are inherently volatile so deriving inflation predictions from bond yields should be taken with a pinch of salt But the shift in prices is broadly in line with what economists are forecasting Last week Bank of America raised its inflation forecasts for much of the world In America it now expects inflation over 2022 as a whole to average 7% up from its prior forecast of 63% In the euro zone it sees an even bigger increase with inflation averaging 6% this year well above its previous forecast of 44% The challenge is greater for Europe because of its high dependency on Russia which supplies about 45% of its gas importsIn an indication of just how pervasive the pressures are likely to be economists are even ratcheting up their inflation forecasts for Japan where deflation has long been the bigger threat On March 8th S&P a rating agency said that Japanese inflation would average 2% this year more than double its previous prediction So far forecasters expect a relatively modest increase in overall inflation in emerging markets But rising food costs will be especially damaging for their poorest citizensTwo related questions emerge from these forecasts The first is whether the rise in commodity prices today will feed through into lofty inflation in the longer run There is in fact reason for cautious optimism A large body of research shows that the pass-through from higher oil prices into non-energy inflation is quite limited For instance Goldman Sachs a bank calculates that a 10% increase in crude-oil prices leads to a jump of nearly three-tenths of a percentage point in headline inflation in America but to an increase of just about three-hundredths of a percentage point in core inflation stripping out food and energy prices That helps explain why market expectations of longer-term price trends remain more subdued: pricing for inflation five years from now is close to the Fed goal of keeping inflation to an average of 2%The follow-up is what central bankers choose to do about rising commodity prices The received wisdom of the past few decades is that policymakers should avoid over-tightening in the face of oil shocks Indeed surging energy prices can act as a drag on consumption which is a particular concern for EuropeBut with real interest rates deeply negative in both America and Europe central banks still have a long way to go to rein in inflation whatever happens to commodity prices On March 10th the European Central Bank surprised markets by announcing that it would wind down its bond-buying more quickly And according to the Fed projections its quarter-point rate increase is likely to be the first of seven this year Central banks are for now sticking to their pre-war plans For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

shipping it to Asia takes 45 Redirecting flows would get even harder if “secondary” sanctions target non-Western firms With Western payment systems out of bounds traders would turn to clunky bartering Better alternatives used by China or others could take years to scale upThis suggests a fair chunk of Russia oil supply could exit the market Other commodities would probably be affected Russia has pledged to respond to a full-blown oil embargo by curtailing gas exports to the West Limits on coal sales would also be painful and would complicate Europe effort to shift away from gas As the quality of its own supply has deteriorated the share of the bloc imports of coal coming from Russia has doubled over the past ten years to 80% In the case of both gas and coal much of Russia's supply would simply not get to market Its gas-storage facilities are almost full It does not have a big enough fleet to ship coal to Asia where it is most in demand it sends coal to Europe by railCall the cartelThe big question is whether an increase in supply from elsewhere could mitigate such losses Start with oil America has already scheduled an increase in oil output of 1m bpd The West could also press members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC to increase supply yielding perhaps another 2m bpd Lifting sanctions on Iran may add another 1m bpd Tapping emergency stocks would help too Last week America and other big oil-consuming countries agreed to release 60m barrels from their stash Hints have been given that they could release moreAll this may increase global supply by 3m-4m bpda lot but perhaps not enough And the extra supply would take too long to arrive OPEC members cannot crank up production fast because they have not invested in new fields for years Restarting American shale wells takes six months;

 Mar 12th 2022,Russia looks to Chinese financial plumbing to keep money flowing,NATIONALIST BLOGGERS in China have a new fascination: global payment systems Vladimir Putin attack on Ukraine followed by Western sanctions on Russia have prompted internet pundits to extol the virtues of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System CIPS the rails on which Chinese banks transfer and clear yuan-denominated payments around the world Some have also taken to bashing SWIFT the Belgium-based financial messaging system that has started excluding Russian banks from international paymentsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCIPS and SWIFT are far from being household names in China But the sweeping sanctions against Russiaon the use of SWIFT by some of its banks and on its central bankhave shone a spotlight on China homegrown financial networks and the extent to which it can use them to help Russia Three primary Chinese financial channels are in place to assisttwo legitimate one not None is a remotely adequate substitute for the links to the Western financial system that Russia has lostFirst consider the direct connections between the two countries’ central banks which do not require SWIFT messaging to make transactions Russia has about $90bn-worth of mainly yuan-denominated deposits held with the Chinese central bank It also has a 150bn-yuan swap-line agreement with China It can use these funds to finance imports from China in the event that other trade-finance routes in dollars are blocked note analysts at Natixis an investment bankBut this trade will largely remain in yuan limiting what Russia can purchase China regulators are still keen to avoid American “secondary” sanctions Primary sanctions target Russian institutions and American firms that deal with them The secondary sort have yet to be used but would target third parties outside America that interact with Russian firms even if those transactions are permitted by local law Allowing Russia to sell yuan-denominated assets in order to raise dollars could attract scrutiny and go beyond what Chinese officials are willing to do for their friends in MoscowNext there are the several complex and widespread financial networks China has spent decades building Take for example the web of state-owned banks that have cropped up in commercial hubs around the world China banking regulator may have stated on March 2nd that the country would not join Western sanctions but most of its big banks will adhere to them particularly those that interact most with the Western financial system and have legal entities that are domiciled in America These large institutions which conduct the bulk of trade finance between the two countries are unlikely to risk getting blocked from dollar clearing in order to continue doing dollar-denominated business with Russia Maintaining full access to global financial markets is “more valuable than anything Russia can offer” according to Neil Shearing of Capital Economics a consultancyUnionPay China state-owned bank-card firm is another powerful financial network It is set to gain market share in Russia in the wake of the departures of Visa and Mastercard which were announced on March 5th Several Russian banks have announced that they will move to UnionPay which already has a significant presence in the countryThis shift will not come easily however Within Russia UnionPay network is small; many banks have no existing relationship with the company For Russians abroad the problem is that despite being in more than 180 countries UnionPay is a fringe service in America and Europe according to Jason Ekberg of Oliver Wyman a consultancyCIPS meanwhile will not be the miracle solution Chinese bloggers hoped for In order to protect its capital account China allows foreign banks to link to CIPS only indirectly through Chinese clearing banks and using SWIFT messaging notes Edwin Lai of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology That means Western sanctions may still apply to any transfers between SWIFT-barred Russian banks and foreign banksA final route for financial assistance will come through backchannel banks that dodge sanctions China has a long history of turning a blind eye to smaller banks that finance trade with countries targeted by America and the UN These activities usually occur on a small scale And many are caught in the act and hit with sanctions themselves In 2012 Bank of Kunlun was targeted by America for doing business with an Iranian bank Some small Chinese banks may take the risk with Russia but they will be unable to provide the large-scale assistance it needsAll told Sino-Russian financial links appear weaker than Russia might hope The situation is likely to raise questions about the shortcomings in China efforts to build global financial networks For CIPS many of the problems are clear In order to maintain control over capital flows China has not linked the system directly with banks outside mainland China with the exception of Standard Chartered a British bank with long-established links to China CIPS indigenous messaging system works only with Chinese banks To improve it China must continue opening it up and granting more direct links with foreign banks The lack of such links is reflected in the system transaction volumes It processes just 13000 per day around one-twentieth of the number handled by America domestic-payments system known as CHIPSChina President Xi Jinping has referred to Mr Putin as a “best friend” The Russian conflict is laying bare some of China financial vulnerabilities That may make the relationship less amicable For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 12th 2022,Western credit markets are holding up remarkably well,CREDIT IS THE financial system oxygen supply When it flows freely it does so unnoticed When it stops soon enough everything else does as well The hypoxic episode that felled the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 unleashed chaos turning a subprime-mortgage crunch into a global financial crisis Ever since central banks and market pundits have fixed a hawk-like gaze on credit conditions wary of a repeatListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday scramble for safe assets was prompted not by a financial crash but by Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine Nevertheless there are similarities Once again the dollar is ascendant as investors flee riskier currencies Hedging costs particularly for the war-adjacent euro are spiking as volatility rises and traders bet that a protracted conflict will continue to favour the greenback A rush into American government debtthe safest asset of allhas pushed Treasury yields down even as inflation expectations have risen Prizing security over returns lenders have driven corporate-bond spreads upThis flight to safety causes plenty of problems on its own A stronger dollar for instance increases the debt burden on countries that borrow in it and dents profits for American companies that earn a lot of their revenues abroad But the greatest threat to financial stability comes from the pressure it exerts on the money market where firms borrow to meet their short-term funding needs This market seizing up is the financial equivalent of a pulmonary embolism quickly forcing otherwise healthy firms up against the wall A dash for dollars is fine if it merely pushes exchange rates up The real trouble comes when it also creates a shortage of themThat happened in 2008 as banks became unwilling to lend to each other and the cost of borrowing for a few months jumped whole percentage points above the overnight rate Events were repeated in a much milder fashion in March 2020 as the world went into covid-induced lockdown On every measure of money-market stress from short-term commercial borrowing costs to the demand for dollars relative to other currencies the impact of Mr Putin war has been milder still see chartThere are two main reasons for this The first is that it follows a flood of liquidity from central banks Since March 2020 the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have issued $91trn 11% of global GDP in new reserves After that deluge notes Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics a consultancy it is almost surprising that there are strains on funding at allThe deeper reason is that money markets are now fitted with a comprehensive ventilation system Permanent swap lines between the Fed and five other big central banks allow them to exchange their own currency for dollars that can be distributed to domestic firms in times of stress A second facility allows a bigger group to simply borrow dollars from the FedMeanwhile banks no longer rely on unsecured loans from each other to plug day-to-day cash shortfalls For funding in dollars the replacement is the repo market where financial institutions and large companies borrow some $25trn from each other every day using Treasuries as security The high-quality collateral makes this market less susceptible to runs making banks and their clients less vulnerable to crises And it is backstopped by the Fed which has acted as lender of last resort since a series of liquidity wobbles in 2019Longer-term credit conditions are also weathering the storm remarkably well Spreads on risky high-yield “junk” bonds have been rising since the beginning of the year but having started at near-historic lows are nowhere near the levels they reached in March 2020For Lotfi Karoui of Goldman Sachs a bank that is unsurprising Around a fifth of the $16trn American high-yield bond market is issued by oil metals and mining firms that are benefiting from rather than being hurt by ballooning commodity prices More generally issuers tend to be sitting on high levels of cash and are using spare revenues to pay down debt keeping their bondholders happy Europe smaller €450bn $496bn high-yield market being geographically closer to the war has been hit correspondingly harder But even there investors are yet to take serious lossesA fortnight into a conflict that could end up being measured in years any claim that credit conditions will remain benign indefinitely would be foolish Mr Karoui points out that central bankers were bound to guard against a money-market shock as that was what led to disaster during the crisis of 2007-09 More dangerous are the risks monetary guardians have less experience with: who can tell for instance if a prolonged war will lead to another much broader gumming-up of global supply chains? Yet for now at least the West financial system is proving vastly more resilient than that of Fortress Russia For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 12th 2022,Our crony-capitalism index offers a window into Russia billionaire wealth,ALTHOUGH BILLIONAIRES have been getting a bad rap for years the sanctions levied at Russian oligarchs have

oligarchs”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe murky money sloshing around the favoured plutocratic playgrounds of New York London and Paris is nothing new In 2014 The Economist devised a crony-capitalism index to measure whether the world was experiencing a new gilded age characterised by the modern equivalent of the robber barons in late-19th-century America In 2016 when we last visited our index we found that crony-capitalists had thrived during the 2000s but were beginning to feel the heat from trustbusters in the rich world and anti-corruption purges in developing countries How has crony capitalism performed since?Rent-seeking entrepreneurs tend to use their relationships with the state to maximise profits Technically speaking an economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid a market price With perfect competition that surplus would not exist But rents can be artificially elevated if firms win contracts at beneficial prices form cartels to stitch up consumers or lobby governments for favourable rules Most rent-seeking businesses are operating perfectly legallyOur index uses 25 years of data from Forbes annual stock-take of the world billionaires In 2021 the publication listed 2755 individuals with total estimated wealth of $13trn We have classified the main source of each billionaire wealth into crony and non-crony sectors Our crony sectors include a host of industries that are vulnerable to rent-seeking because of their proximity to the state such as banking casinos defence extractive industries and construction We have aggregated the data according to billionaires’ country of citizenship expressed as a share of its GDPRussia crony economy sticks out like a blinged-up Muscovite in the Algarve Some 70% of the 120 Russian billionaires who together hold 80% of its billionaire wealth fall within our crony-capitalist definition Wealth equivalent to 28% of Russia GDP in 2021 came from crony sectors up from 18% in 2016 But many Russian oligarchs will be taking haircuts on their empires as sanctions biteGlobally crony wealth has declined as a share of the total reflecting in part the surge in tech-related wealth Nonetheless it remains entrenched in many places In Malaysia a former prime minister was jailed for corruption in 2020 after $45bn was stolen from the state but crony capitalism still dominates there India share of billionaire wealth derived from crony sectors has risen from 29% to 43% in six years The Philippines has fallen to fourth in our index but crony sectors still account for four-fifths of total billionaire wealthBy contrast around four-fifths of American billionaires accounting for 90% of total wealth operate in non-crony sectors Led by a boom in tech valuations wealth in non-crony sectors rose from 11% to 17% of GDP between 2016 and 2021 But in recent years America has opened investigations into the firms of its behemoth-building billionaires Tech firms do exhibit some of the cosseted characteristics of crony industries: they spend heavily on lobbying to defend their juicy market shares for instance Reclassifying technology firms as crony would increase America crony wealth from 2% to 7% of GDPOver the past decade China has minted new billionaires faster than you can say Yves Saint Laurent In 2010 there were 89 Now there are 714 with a combined wealth of $3trn around 70% of the amount in America The crony-sector share of GDP has changed little in six years though its share of overall billionaire wealth has fallen from 44% to 24% This exposes one of the shortcomings of our index: to some extent all businesses operate in China with the consent of the state Falling out of favour can have grave consequences as Alibaba Jack Ma discovered in 2020 Assuming all Chinese billionaires are cronyistic would place China second in our indexBillionaires in autocratic countries remain vulnerable to the whims of their leaders Mikhail Khodorkovsky was worth $15bn in 2004 but he fell out with Vladimir Putin and his oil firm was expropriated A purge in Saudi Arabia has meant not a single billionaire from the kingdom has appeared on Forbes list since 2017 Billionaires in autocratic countries outside China derive about 70% of their wealth from crony sectors A good chunk of this $750bn is likely to be stashed in Western countries that do not ask too many

 Mar 12th 2022,How oil shocks have become less shocking,THE OMENS are bad for the world economy When oil prices surge growth typically moves in the opposite direction Sometimes the price shock begins with a political earthquake like the Suez crisis of 1956 Sometimes oil producers deliberately create the shock as with the OPEC embargo of 1973 And sometimes the culprit is soaring demand such as when oil prices hit record highs in 2008 The common denominator in all these cases is that America and most other rich countries soon enough faced recessionsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSo it would hardly be surprising if the current surge in oil pricesa doubling in three months fuelled by Russia invasion of Ukraineforeshadows a sharp downturn in growth Pictet an asset manager counts six episodes since 1970 in which real oil prices rose by more than 50% from their previous trend; each preceded a recession As of late February oil prices had already surpassed this 50% threshold and have only climbed higher since thenNevertheless the easily observed relationship between oil and the economy is no iron law There have been times when crude prices soared and yet recessions were averted including the peak of a global commodities boom in 2011 The type of shock matters as does the economic backdrop Moreover much of the world appears to have become better insulated from oil markets over time Old dismal patterns may not perfectly repeat themselvesConsider the mechanics by which rising oil prices hurt growth Energy is an important factor of production so a sharp decrease in its supply or increase in its price may drag down output It may also hurt demand: if people spend more of their incomes on oil less is left over for other things Add to this the possibility that central banks may tighten monetary policy aggressively when higher oil prices push up inflation as the Federal Reserve did following the OPEC crisis of 1973 and the Iranian revolution of 1979Yet no two oil shocks are the same A critical variable is whether the shock stems from the economy supply side or demand side If there is a sudden shortfall in supply as during an embargo that functions as a new tax on production and consumption If however robust demand is the cause rising oil prices reflect economic vitality Lutz Kilian an economist with the Fed branch in Dallas has shown that broad demand strength can for a time outweigh the negative effects of higher oil prices A pure supply shock is by contrast more harmful The period since the pandemic struck has featured a bit of both The quadrupling in crude prices from the spring of 2020 to the start of 2022 reflected growth roaring back from its pandemic-induced slowdown Only the most recent surge is unquestionably a supply shock caused by the Ukraine war and associated sanctionsThree changes in the structure of the global economy may dampen the effects of the price surge Most obviously oil role in growth cycles is not what it used to be In 1973 the world used nearly one barrel of oil to produce $1000-worth of GDP in inflation-adjusted terms By 2019 that was down to 043 barrels with the energy intensity of growth falling annually “in an almost perfectly linear fashion” according to a report last year by the Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University A shift in economic output from industry to services is part of the explanation The world has also become more efficient in using oil Cars for instance go twice as far per gallon of petrol as in the 1970sA related change is the way that governments respond to oil shocks As James Hamilton of the University of California San Diego has observed in the 1970s American officials aggravated economic dislocations with price controls on petrol which resulted in shortages Since 1981 they have steered clear of such controls which has made for more volatile crude prices but smoother market adjustments Some tweaks in behaviour have got easier thanks to the pandemic: if air fares soar why fly to that business meeting when you can log on to Zoom instead?Central bankers may also be less tempted to jack up interest rates simply because of soaring energy prices thereby reducing the risks of a recession There is a debate over whether the pass-through from oil shocks to core inflation is basically nil as argued in a paper for the Fed by Todd Clark and Stephen Terry or small as argued in another Fed paper by Cristina Conflitti and Matteo Luciani However the experts agree that the pass-through has weakened in part because of the diminished energy intensity of growth Even before the war in Ukraine the Fed was set to raise interest rates several times this year in order to rein in inflation The salient point is that according to market pricing investors do not believe that the oil shock will lead to much more aggressive moves by the Fed than previously expectedShale fellow well metA final difference with past oil shocks is the momentous evolution of America status in the global crude industry In the first decade of the 2000s America imported more than 10m barrels of oil per day in net terms With the shale revolution American oil production has soared such that it now meets most of its energy needs from its domestic production In 2020 America became a net exporter for the first time since at least 1949One effect is that oil shocks are now less destabilising for the American economy in aggregate Consumers may dislike rising crude prices but oil producers enjoy them A key question in the months ahead will be the extent to which they expand drilling That would help offset the economic loss from softer consumer spending And for the rest of the world a resilient American economy would provide useful ballast amid all the turbulence The EU must worry not just about oil but also about a much more acute shortage of natural gas Should it join America and Britain in banning Russian imports the price of crude could go much higher still But at oil current

the number of people deemed food-insecure at 800m was at its highest for a decade Many more could soon join them Higher food prices will also stoke inflation adding to the price pressures generated by dearer energyThe fallout from the war will be felt in three ways: disruption to current grain shipments low or inaccessible future harvests in Ukraine and Russia and withered production in other parts of the world Start with shipments In normal times wheat and barley crops are harvested in the summer and exported in the autumn; by February most ships are gone But these are not normal times: with global stocks low big importers of Black Sea wheat chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa are anxious to secure more supplies They are not getting them Ukrainian ports are shut Some have been bombed Inland routes via the north of Ukraine and onwards through Poland are too great a diversion to be practical Vessels trying to pick up grain from Russia have been hit by missiles in the Black Sea Most cannot get insuranceAlternative sources are unaffordable Last week Egypt cancelled its second wheat tender in a row after receiving only three offersat a stomach-churning pricedown from 20 a fortnight before More concerning still exports of corn of which Ukraine accounts for nearly 13% of global exports usually take place through the spring until the early summer Much of it is normally shipped from the port of Odessa which is bracing for a Russian assaultFuture crops are an even bigger worry In Ukraine the war may result in lower yields and area planted Winter crops such as wheat and barley which are sown in October could be smaller because of a lack of fertiliser and pesticides Spring crops such as corn and sunflowers the planting of which would normally start imminently may not get sown at all Leonid Tsentilo whose farm in central Ukraine grows 7000 tonnes of wheat a year says local prices for diesel and plant-protection products have risen by 50% in two weeks Some of his workers have been shipped off to warIn Russia the risk is not curtailed production but blockaded exports Although food sales are not yet subject to sanctions Western banks are reluctant to lend to traders Fear of being fined by governments in the West or shamed by its press is keeping merchants at bay While Ukraine is “unreachable” Russia is “untouchable” says Michael Magdovitz of RabobankMost alarming will be the conflict impact on agriculture worldwide The region is a big supplier of critical fertiliser components including natural gas and potash Fertiliser prices had already doubled or tripled depending on the type even before the war owing to rising energy and transport costs and sanctions imposed in 2021 on Belarus which produces 18% of the world potash as it cracked down on dissidents As Russia which accounts for 20% of global output finds it harder to export its own potash prices are sure to rise further Since four-fifths of the world potash is traded internationally the impact of price spikes will be felt in every agricultural region in the world warns Humphrey Knight of CRU a consultancyAs a result of all this a much greater share of incomes will soon be spent on food see chart This will be felt most acutely in the Middle East Africa and parts of Asia where some 800m people depend heavily on Black Sea wheat That includes Turkey which supplies much of the southern Mediterranean with flour Egypt usually buys 70% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine The latter alone accounts for half of Lebanon wheat imports Many others can hardly do without Ukraine corn soyabeans and vegetable oilMeanwhile higher fertiliser and energy costs will crimp farmers’ margins everywhere Brazil a huge producer of meat and agricultural products imports 46% of its potash from either Russia or Belarus says Cristiano Veloso of Verde AgriTech a Brazilian startup Eventually some of the costs will be passed on to the consumerProtectionism may pour more fuel on the fire National restrictions on fertiliser exports increased last year and could accelerate Limits on food exports or panic-buying by importers could trigger a price spike of the kind that sparked riots in dozens of countries in 2007-08 On March 8th and 9th respectively Russia and Ukraine banned wheat exports Argentina Hungary Indonesia and Turkey have announced food-export restrictions in recent daysThere is no easy fix Some of the 160m tonnes of wheat used as animal feed every year could be diverted for human consumption but substitution may export inflation to other staples Increasing production in Europe and America and drawing on India vast strategic stockpile may yield 10-15m tonnesa substantial quantity but less than a third of Ukraine and Russia combined annual exports Some could come from farther afield but there are bottlenecks: efforts to export more of Australia bumper winter-wheat crop have clogged the supply chains between its farms and ports With corn governments may resort to appropriating some of the 148m tonnes used as bioethanol feed to help plug this year likely shortfall of 35m tonnes Fertiliser shortages are even harder to cover: new potash mines take 5-10 years to buildThe war in Ukraine is already a tragedy As it ravages the world breadbasket a calamity looms For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 7th 2022,The West threat of a ban on Russian oil shakes markets,“WE ARE NOW talking to our European partners and allies to look in a co-ordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil” With that bombshell announcement on March 6th Antony Blinken America secretary of state set global oil markets ablaze In the hours that followed the price of West Texas Intermediate WTI the American benchmark crude shot up by more than 9% Brent crude soared to nearly $140 a barrel double the price on December 1st before dropping to $123 on March 7th There is now speculation that oil could touch $200 a barrel if the war in Ukraine gets uglierThat is the volatile backdrop to the oil industry most important gathering of the year Thousands of energy executives and other grandees including the bosses of Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and America energy secretary have come to Houston for CERAWeek an annual conference put on by S&P Global a financial-information firm This week programme encompasses long-term issues like climate change and the energy transition but recent events ensure that geopolitics will dominate the gabfestOil markets are on a knife edge for three reasons First worries are growing that supply may be inadequate to cover disruptions The balance between demand and supply was already tight last year Fossil-fuel consumption rebounded strongly from the covid-induced slump in 2021 The International Energy Agency IEA an official forecaster even expects global oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels by year-end With covid in retreat for now Americans are getting their gas-guzzlers ready for the summer “driving season”That says Abhi Rajendran of Energy Intelligence an industry publisher means firms should be building inventories now but they are not The snag is that oil supply has remained constrained as the result of under-investment and covid-related factors The OPEC cartel has not been able to meet its own production quotas Mr Rajendran reckons the market was undersupplied by some 1m barrels per day bpd before the war in Ukraine That had pushed prices towards $100 a barrelThe second reason for prices surging in response to Mr Blinken statement is the fact that Russia with its 45m bpd of crude exports and additional 25m bpd of oil-product exports is the world second-biggest exporter of petroleum If all those exports were cut off as the result of an American-led energy embargo or through Vladimir Putin using export curbs as an economic weapon the world economy would be dealt a severe blowTo soften it the West has turned to buffer stocks The IEA announced on March 1st that its member countries will co-ordinate the release of some 60m barrels of oil from their strategic reserves The only times the IEA has previously done this were during the Iraq-Kuwait war in 1990 Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Libyan civil war in 2011 But Damien Courvalin of Goldman Sachs a bank argues that this one-off release of strategic stocks is “dwarfed by the potential magnitude of Russia export disruptions” He reckons it would not offset the loss of Russian seaborne exports for longMoreover no other supplier nor any combination of them could produce sufficient incremental volumes of oil quickly enough to replace the loss of all Russian exports James West of Evercore an investment bank reckons that even mighty Saudi Arabia can manage at most an extra 1m bpd of production within a few months Total OPEC spare capacity is not much more than 2m bpd Oil output is growing in Canada Brazil and Guyana but even taken together their growth will be far less than 1m bpd this yearThat is why America energy diplomats are working overtime to find other sources of oil to make up for any Russian shortfall One territory they are exploring is their own shale country Top federal officials from several different cabinet ministries have landed at CERAWeek hoping to woo American oilmen into cranking out more black gold The petroleum lobby is not happy with the Biden administration which it sees as climate-obsessed and vindictive towards fossil fuels so these overtures are likely to prove awkward What is more American shale output is already set to expand by 1m bpd this year Serious supply-chain stresses one oilman complains that the price of sand a vital component in the shale process has tripled of late stand in the way of doubling thatwhich could not happen in less than a year in any caseOne development that would be helpful is a lifting of sanctions on Iran That could potentially increase exports by around half a million bpd within six months and double that within a year Last week it appeared as though a sanctions-easing deal between Iran America and other world powers was close However it was dealt a setback by sudden demands by Russia for guarantees from America that any sanctions over Ukraine would not affect Russian trade with Iran American negotiators are also reportedly negotiating now with Venezuela another country with oil exports restricted by sanctions but Mr Courvalin reckons this could produce only about half a million bpd in extra exports within a yearThe emergence of “self-sanctions” is the third reason energy traders are worried Strikingly Russian petroleum exports have become toxic even before America has imposed any overt ban on them The sanctions imposed thus far on Russia have explicitly avoided targeting its energy sector but Fatih Birol head of the IEA notes that this has not prevented them from curtailing its petroleum exports “There is confusion in many parts of the world about whether buying Russian oil is affected by sanctions or not” he says As a result many counterparties are steering clear of anything RussianThat has sent Russian oil exports into a dive David Fyfe of Argus an energy publisher reckons that some 2m bpd of Russian petroleum is “already off the market one way or another” Western oil majors have come under intense pressure to limit their use of Russian crude and refined products Even firms in China and India normally relaxed about circumventing American sanctions are avoiding doing business with Russian-owned operated or flagged vessels or Russian ports When news surfaced that Shell stood to make a $20m profit trading a discounted cargo of Russian crude after piously withdrawing from several joint ventures in the country the firm suffered a backlash prompting it to announce it would place any profits from Russian oil into a Ukraine aid fundA slippery predicamentThe prospect of a Russian oil embargo poses a dilemma for America On one hand Western leaders want to punish Russia for its aggression without putting troops on the ground in Ukraine and energy is the most powerful of the tools they have not yet used; Russia biggest remaining vulnerability is its massive energy exports On the other hand precisely because its exports are so big cutting them off all at once would risk destabilising the world economy The IMF warned on March 5th that the consequences of the war and the economic sanctions are already “very serious” and if things escalate could become “more devastating”That is why Mr Blinken went on in his statement on March 6th to say that America would only impose a ban on Russian exports with allies or if necessary on its own if it can ensure that “there still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets” Allies’ reluctance to join in may be understandable given that America imports little Russian oil whereas Europe is Russia biggest customer: it imports 27m bpd of crude and 1m bpd of oil feedstocks and products from Russia according to Richard Joswick of S&P Global Commodity InsightsIs Mr Blinken serious? A “shock and awe” ban risks pushing America and Europe into recession That may tempt them into another less dramatic option They could finesse things with graduated sanctions as America did with Iran Imposing energy sanctions that ratchet down Russia permitted exports every few months would give it an incentive to curb its bad behaviour But the creative ambiguity and clumsiness involved in any attempt to finesse an embargo might lead to an oil shock all the same
 Mar 5th 2022,China scrambles to prevent property pandemonium,NOT LONG ago prospective homebuyers in China would find large maps on the walls of property marketing offices On display were not only the housing projects for sale The maps also showed the parcels of government land surrounding the projects and their expected future prices which were often higher than the home units for sale per square metre The implication for the anxious buyer-to-be was clear: buy now or regret it forever Very soon land prices would be far higher next doorListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe maps tell the story of China decades-long build-up in property debts These seemingly endless increases in prices were made possible only because developers had access to almost unlimited credit Ample loans offshore-dollar bonds and deposits from buyers once fuelled bidding wars between them that pumped up land values The winner was sure to turn a huge profit if they held onto the parcel and waited for the price to rise Local governments too happily gorged; land sales contributed 43% of their revenues in 2021Homebuyers are seeing a very different picture now Xi Jinping China president has been fearful of runaway unaffordability and untenable debt He has turned off the tap of easy credit by capping developers’ ratios of liabilities to assets net debt to equity and cash to short-term debt known as the “three red lines” This has pushed China property sector to the edge A dozen developers including Evergrande one of the world most indebted property groups have defaulted on bonds since July 2021 or have come close Companies recently deemed safe bets for investors have suddenly started looking wobbly One of those Shimao missed trust payments on February 24th Zhenro Properties stunned creditors on February 21st when it said it may not repay creditors in early MarchThe implications go far beyond the offshore bond market Construction has stalled in places Some developers are now selling assets to patch up their cash flows Many have stopped buying land causing the value of parcels sold by local governments to crater by 72% in January year on year Home prices are falling in many cities turning off speculators looking for the guaranteed huge gains once advertised on sales-office maps Families looking for flats wonder if they can even be builtWhether the central government holds firmly to its red lines is unclear If it does the property market will be forced to make a monumental adjustment to better match supply with real household demand for homes The annual supply of homes is now three times that of future urban-household formation reckons Rhodium a consultancy Sales must fall from around 15m units per year to about 10mAs the bubble deflates the effects are rippling through the Chinese economy Senior leaders have yet to issue an economic growth target for 2022 but many economists expect them to draw a line at 5% China GDP grew by nearly 6% in 2019 This will be a difficult rate to defend should the property sector which makes up an estimated 25% of GDP continue to crumble A major slowdown in turn would hamper a global economy already hobbled by soaring inflation and geopolitical clashesPolicymakers in Beijing must fulfil three major tasks if they are to avoid catastrophe First they must make sure offshore defaults do not spiral out of control closing out Chinese issuers from the dollar bond market A second task is to ensure firms continue to build homes and families continue to buy them This is crucial for economic growth this year A third daunting challenge is to formulate a long-term plan that brings some stability to the market over the next decadeMr Xi probably did not anticipate such a rapid rise in offshore defaults Altogether some $100bn in debts needs to be repaid this year Evergrande the group with $300bn in liabilities has been the biggest worry It defaulted in December and has become one of the largest restructuring cases in history Investors are tracking the case for reasons to be optimistic The group is now thought to be under a high degree of government control It has promised to deliver a restructuring plan by July State involvement is good because it will help avoid a total collapse says one person involved in the restructuring It also means that stability will be the main priority not speed or efficiencyResources are running low Legal expertise on such cross-border situations involving China is limited and so far many Chinese defaulters have been unwilling to cough up for high-quality advice Accounting firms have abruptly resigned from auditing developers’ books The early restructuring plans for a few Chinese developers have made little room for offshore creditors says a lawyer working on a case Evergrande offshore bonds currently trade at 15 cents on the dollara gloomy signal on what investors expect to get back High-yield dollar bond issuance by Chinese companiesan important source of credit for themhas fallen substantiallyA second task for the Communist Party will be to keep developers building and buyers buying Sales for the 100 biggest firms came down by close to half in February compared to the same month last year Investment in property fell by 14% in December Prices in many cities have declined Domestic sales of excavators nearly halved in January year on yearPolicymakers are fidgety Like global hedge funds they want to avoid ugly incidents at companies such as Zhenro The sudden shocks arise because developers have not been giving a clear picture of their total cash positions They include billions of yuan held tightly in escrow accounts by local governments who want to ensure the money is used to build homes not pay creditors When payments come due the companies cannot access all the cash they say they have Fitch a rating agency downgraded Ronshine another large developer on February 22nd on concerns that it would fail to access such fundsTrapped cash is also halting some construction Many workers have laid down their shovels after going unpaid Evergrande has claimed it can build 600000 homes this yearmusic to officials’ ears Yet on February 16th a court in mainland China froze 640m yuan $101m of the company cash after it could not pay a state-owned construction groupThe central government plans to standardise escrow accounts so that less of the developers’ cash is locked into them But that will not be enough to rescue the sector Investors hope that Beijing blinks and reverses some of its tough policies Some local governments have already flinched The city of Zhengzhou in central China on March 1st said it would make it easier for people to buy second homes In the south the city of Guangzhou cut mortgage-loan rates by 20 basis points on February 22nd Banks in Shanghai have made similar cutsIf more cities follow developers may avoid facing up to the reality that household demand is lower than they wantat least for a bit longer Analysts still have big questions on developers’ true levels of cash and debt Many are thought to have huge off-balance-sheet debts that have gone unreported says Luther Chai of CreditSights a research firm Eight large developers with offshore bonds currently have far less unrestricted cash than short-term debts Evergrande has just 40% of the cash it would need to pay its known short-term debts Another large developer Golden Wheel Tiandi has just 20%Mr Xi loves to say that the Chinese people face “three great mountains” between them and their prosperity Those are education health care and housing The first two are already dominated by the state Housing is still largely controlled by tycoons From the government perspective it would make sense if much more of the property sector eventually became state-run says Robin Xing of Morgan StanleyThis appears to be part of the long-term planthe Communist Party third work in progress The state is already getting involved in two ways The first is through state-owned asset-management companies AMCs that buy up bad debt on command One of those Cinda is already working with Evergrande But others are said to be quietly absorbing bad debts from developers in effect acting as a buffer for the banking system This has ruled out the need for a major state bail-out because the AMCs are drip-feeding support to many companies says a credit investorThe state is also set to take a more direct long-term role in the property market through buying up subsidiaries of private developers Evergrande said on February 25th that it would sell four projects to state-owned companies In late January Sunac once an aggressive private acquirer of property assets sold a 40% stake in a local subsidiary to state-run Huafa Group Regulators are encouraging the trend by asking banks to loosen up on lending for mergers and acquisitions State banks plan to issue about $4bn in bonds to fund property mergers according to Caixin a financial magazine State developers are also buying up swathes of land to help shore up local government finances Given state firms’ reputation for inefficiency the potential for waste is hugeTax could also become a bigger part of future housing policy In theory a housing tax would serve two purposes: discouraging speculation and generating local revenues But experts have noted that those targets conflict A tax that discourages investment will also limit governments’ income A tax pilot in Shanghai is set as low as 04% of the latest sales price This has neither deterred investors nor generated much revenue for local officials There is no neat solution for delinking local revenues from land sales Few local officials want to make a shift away from easy land sales and receive a “sucker payoff” in return says Adam Liu of the National University of SingaporeMore extreme fixes are being floated In January Evergrande former chief economist Ren Zeping said China should bankroll 50m births over the next decade by printing 2trn yuan in new cash for family handouts effectively creating millions of future homebuyers The controversial idea got him blocked from posting on Weibo a Twitter-like platform But it also highlighted the desperate nature of China demographic shortfallsIf policymakers stick to their guns on limiting developer leverage the property market must hew to real demand from families in the coming decade That will mean a much smaller market New housing starts peaked in 2019 at around 18bn square metres doubling from 2008 In a highly optimistic scenario in which 65% of China roughly 170m people currently aged 16-25 eventually live in cities and 90% of those enter the housing market that still only creates demand for about 50m homes over the next decade estimate Allen Feng and Logan Wright at RhodiumEven if each of those new households bought two homes the current rate of building would fulfil that demand in just five and a half years “Supply needs to adjust”

 Mar 5th 2022,War and sanctions means higher inflation,RUSSIA MAY have tried to build a “fortress economy” but it is the West that currently looks financially impervious Compared with the deep economic crisis brought about in the country by Western sanctions the consequences for the rich world have been small Though American stocks fell sharply when the war started on February 24th on March 2nd they closed almost 4% higher than their level the night before the invasion European stocks are about 4% downa big hit but nothing compared with the financial rout under way in Russia where the currency has collapsed and stockmarket trading has been suspended for daysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn part the muted reaction reflects Russia low weight in the global economy: about 2% in dollar terms The country relative poverty and smaller population when compared with the rest of Europe mean that its exporters depend on European demand but not vice versa Goldman Sachs a bank estimates that the loss of exports caused by a 10% fall in Russian spending would cost the euro zone only about 01% of its GDP and Britain still less Financial links are modestYet Russia economic importance vastly outweighs its GDP or financial clout owing to its energy exports It produces nearly a fifth of the world natural gas and more than a tenth of the world oil the price of which drives much of the short-term variation in global inflation Typically 30-40% of the EU gas supply comes from Russia though this has fallen to about 20% in recent months as Europe has increased its imports of LNG from America It does not just heat Europe homes but also powers much of its industrial production Among big economies Italy and Germany are particularly exposedEnergy prices increased dramatically on March 1st and 2nd European natural-gas spot prices are now more than double their level at the start of February So are futures prices for delivery in December 2022 reflecting in part the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany which had been hoped to ease supply this year The oil price is up over 25% to about $115 per barrel The energy squeeze will worsen Europe inflation problem while also hitting its growth JPMorgan Chase a bank has raised its forecast for euro-area inflation at the end of the year by 11 percentage points to 36% while cutting its growth forecast for 2022 by 06 percentage points to 41% As a producer of oil and gas America is mostly insulated from the drag on growth but will feel the inflationary effects of pricier oilThings could get much worse should sanctions expand in scope to cover energy purchases or if Russia retaliates against them by reducing its exports JPMorgan Chase projects that a sustained shut-off of the Russian oil supply might cause prices to rise to $150 per barrel a level sufficient to knock 16% off global GDP while raising consumer prices by another 2% The stagflationary shock would carry echoes of the Yom Kippur war of 1973 which sparked the first of the two energy crises of that decade It greatly worsened an existing inflation problem caused in part by the collapse earlier that year of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates Today much pricier energy would be layered atop the inflation caused by the pandemic and the associated stimulusIf the oil and gas keep flowing the existing increases in their respective prices will still make life uncomfortable for central banks who were anyway raising or preparing to raise interest rates They usually tolerate inflation caused by expensive energy It tends to quickly dissipate or even go into reverse But recently they have worried that the persistence of high inflation since last summer might lead companies to think they should continue to increase prices at a rapid pace and workers to continue to ask for higher wages Inflation in other words may have taken on a momentum of its own Further increases in energy prices can only heighten that dangerwhile adding to the squeeze on growth that higher interest rates bring aboutAt present markets are priced for a fairly conventional policy response Since February 1st investors’ inflation expectations as revealed by the price of swaps have risen sharply at a one-year horizon for Britain America and the euro zone Yet expectations for longer-term inflation as measured by long-dated forward swaps have not changed much see chart Projections of the ECB policy rate at the end of the year have barely changed Investors have priced in another quarter-of-a-percentage-point rise in interest rates this year in both Britain and America On March 2nd Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal reserve indicated that it would still raise ratesThere have however been sharp movements in bond yields at longer horizons In mid-February yields on five-year German government bonds had been in positive territory for the first time since 2018 They have since fallen to about -025% On March 1st and 2nd the yield on an American ten-year Treasury bond fell from nearly 2% to 17% a greater fall than in any two-day trading period since March 2020 before recovering slightly to 19% the next dayIn other words investors are betting that today inflation even once exacerbated by the war in Ukraine will be temporaryand that over the long term interest rates are likely to be a bit lower than on past projections But that hardly means markets are sanguine In recent years some scholars have argued that low long-term real interest rates reflect in part the impulse to hoard safe assets as tail risksrare but highly costly eventsgrow more likely After two years of a pandemic and with war raging in Europe that thesis has never seemed so apposite For more expert analysis of the biggest stories

 Mar 5th 2022,The war in Europe is a triple whammy for emerging markets,EVEN BEFORE Russia invaded Ukraine emerging markets were braced for a testing year The conflict threatens to lengthen a list of woes that already included inflation slowing growth public finances strained by rising interest rates and lingering disruptions from covid-19 In a worst-case scenario the fallout may even top all these concernsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as

economy is mid-weight and only loosely integrated with global supply chains It is not a major market for exports Steps taken by Western banks to reduce their exposure to Russia following its seizure of Crimea in 2014 also limit the risk of direct financial contagion Instead the fallout for the emerging world will come in three indirect waysThe first channel is that of global liquidity conditions which are tightening Though the war does not seem to pose a serious financial-stability threat at the moment markets have grown nervier If worry were to give way to panic the rush to obtain dollars could cause liquidity to dry up and markets to malfunctionrecalling the breakdowns seen in the early months of the pandemic Then it took huge interventions by America Federal Reserve and other central banks to prevent a global financial shock And even with that mighty support most emerging economies faced a rapid and painful adjustment as their currencies tumbled A few were pushed into defaultFor now such disasters seem a distant possibility The invasion has nonetheless prompted investors to flock to assets they deem the least risky Stockmarkets across the emerging world have slipped since mid-February Over the week following the beginning of the war yields on German bunds and American Treasuries traditional safe havens have been down by as much as 03 percentage points Slowly but

short-term unsecured loans and the overnight risk-free rate has risen But the uptick is dwarfed by the spike observed during the wild gyrations of early 2020 to say nothing of the market madness seen during the global financial crisisA flight to safety could raise the cost of borrowing across emerging markets and increase the burden of debt Prices for hard-currency bonds issued by governments and firms have fallen over the past week while the spread between the yield on emerging-market corporate bonds and that on Treasury bonds has jumped by about half a percentage point That too is a modest rise relative to what markets experienced in the spring of 2020 when the spread leapt by four percentage points in the space of a month But higher borrowing costs for governments and firms are less easily managed after two years of rising indebtedness And even in the absence of default dearer credit stands to crimp private investment and further limit governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvreAdverse moves on markets could exacerbate the challenges caused by new macroeconomic headwindsthe second channel of contagion In peacetime both Russia and Ukraine are big exporters of commodities including oil and gas precious and industrial metals and agricultural products Since mid-February prices for many of these have jumped Oil prices are up by more than 25% over the past fortnight The price of wheat has soared by more than 30% Some emerging-market exporters stand to benefit from rising proceeds For Gulf economies the surge in crude prices is an unexpected windfallYet even the biggest commodity exporters are likely to face difficulties when food and energy costs rise above already high levels squeezing household budgets and putting monetary policymakers in a bind Before the war a year-long campaign by Brazil central bank to rein in high inflationin which it raised its benchmark interest rate by nearly nine percentage pointsseemed to be bearing fruit Now food and energy price shocks it can do little about threaten to spoil its fragile achievement Turkey where year-on-year inflation surged to nearly 50% in January is in an even stickier spot On March 1st the Turkish defence minister urged Russia to accept an immediate ceasefire Large importers of wheat and sunflower oil across north Africa and the Middle East most notably Egypt may see the price of staples rocket fuelling popular discontentAs these developments unfold a third force will operate in the background Russian aggression and the West shock-and-awe financial and economic response represent another jolt to a global economy which over the past half-decade has weathered trade wars a pandemic supply-chain disruptions and an increasingly unpredictable policy environment As firms and investors watch the carnage in eastern Europe they may reassess how to price geopolitical risk in foreign markets That could inflate country-risk premiums applied to far-flung assets increasing the cost of funding for emerging markets and reducing investment volumesIn difficult times the saying goes global investors worry less about the return on capital than the return of it Should many of them decide to pack up and go home the war collateral damage will include that suffered by the emerging economies they leave behind For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 Mar 5th 2022,South Korea economy threatens to become like Japan,IN 1989 AT the peak of Japan economic and financial heyday few dared suggest the country might one day be supplanted as the richest large nation in Asia Per person South Korea was not even half as affluent But then mighty stock and land bubbles popped in Tokyo kick-starting several “lost” decades for the Land of the Rising Sun Meanwhile South Korea economy boomed By 2018 its GDP per person adjusted for purchasing power topped JapanListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSimilarities between the two economies extend beyond converging income levels Both built their wealth during periods of export-led growth Now South Korea working-age population is shrinking as Japan did after the mid-1990s Most uncanny are echoes between the financial risks which emerged in Japan in the late 1980s and those mounting in South Korea today They too could trap Asia mightiest tiger in the doldrums for decadesSuper-expensive houses have become a major issue in South Korea tight presidential election which takes place on March 9th The two front-runnersLee Jae-myung of the ruling Minjoo Party and Yoon Seok-youl of the centre-right People Power Partyhave clashed over housing policy throughout the campaignThe outgoing government repeated efforts to rein in the property market through tighter loan-to-value restrictions on mortgage-lending and steeper taxes on owners of multiple homes have had little effect Low interest rates and an ageing population seeking rental income as it nears retirement have proved stronger forces In the Seoul metropolitan area home to around half of South Korea 52m people property prices have almost doubled in the past ten yearsThere is no specific threshold beyond which the value of all land in a country relative to the size of its economy suggests asset prices are unsustainable But the ratio for South Korea is both high by international standards and relative to the country recent history It now runs at five times its GDP up from around four times in 2013 At the peak of Japan folly the value of all land rose to 54 times GDP before collapsing through the 1990sPricking South Korea apparent bubble would be less dangerous had liabilities not risen in tandem with asset values South Korean people and firms have been borrowing at a frantic pace In September last year the country household debt stood at 107% of its GDP compared with 58% in Germany and 79% in America Non-financial corporate debt runs to 114% above the average for advanced economiesThis too recalls 1980s Japanand not in a good way Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo warns of a possible “balance-sheet recession” During Japan boom years asset values and liabilities surged together When its land-and-stock bubble burst asset values crumbled but borrowers still had the same liabilities to repay That left them in a state of negative equity As firms and households all rushed to deleverage the economy shrunk “Individually they were doing the right thing Collectively they were destroying the economy” says Mr KooIn 2020 the IMF flagged that South Korea was only one accident away from a damaging balance-sheet recession Although lending to subprime borrowers was limited it noted that about half of South Korea household credit was either linked to floating interest rates or required large lump-sum repayments meaning it would need to be refinanced at potentially higher interest rates It also noted that the country many small- and mid-sized firms dependent on shorter-term bank loans backed by property collateral looked exposedHas the dreaded accident arrived? South Korea was one of the first major economies to raise interest rates during the pandemic and has now done so three times Most analysts expect the tightening to continue: the central bank has said it is concerned about both rising inflation and the financial-stability risk posed by soaring asset values Yet again that has an 1980s flavour: Japan troubles began when the central bank started raising rates rapidly to pop the country asset bubbleThe Bank of Korea policy of “leaning against the wind” as Jeong Woo Park of Nomura calls it is having snowballing effects that may be hard to stop As a result of stricter credit controls introduced to cool down property prices mortgage interest rates are accelerating faster than benchmark ones After surging through pre-pandemic levels they flirted with decade-highs in JanuaryThe parallel has limits Japan financial institutions were famously poorly regulated leaving policymakers constantly surprised by the level of damage done to the financial system as crises popped up repeatedly through the 1990s South Korea unusual Jeonse credit system through which households borrow to fund lump-sum rental payments makes it difficult to assess how risky household debt truly isBut the scary similarities will continue to grow as South Korean politicians central bankers and regulators endeavour to engineer a smooth end to the explosion in asset prices They have the Japanese experience to learn from But understanding the worst-case scenario may prove easier than avoiding it For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Mar 5th 2022,Vladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling,FOLLOWING RUSSIA’S invasion of Ukraine an economic war has begun The West has imposed unprecedented sanctions Investors are dumping Russian assets as fast as they can So far this year the rouble has lost one-third of its value The government may soon default Capital Economics a consultancy expects Russian inflation to hit 15% before long with GDP falling by 5% this yearListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe ructions in Russia markets have taken many by surprise For years President Vladimir Putin had apparently successfully built up Russia economic defences such that it would easily be able to resist whatever Western governments threw at itwhat Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management dubbed the “Fortress Russia” strategy It turns out that the strategy has been a failure “From Fortress Russia to Rubble Russia in a week” says Mr AshFortress Russia was a product of Russia chaotic recent history Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 inflation exceeded 2000% In 1998 Russia defaulted causing the value of the rouble to fall by more than two-thirds Then in 2014 a collapse in oil prices plus international sanctions over Russia actions in Crimea and the Donbas sent the economy into a deep recessionAs Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy show in “Mr Putin: Operative in the Kremlin” a book published in 2015 the Russian president has long wished that his country could be self-reliant Since 2014 however that ideology has gone into overdrive with Mr Putin desperate to ensure that the West could never again exert economic control over his countryThe idea for Fortress Russia went something like this On the economic front Russia would diversify its economy away from oil and gas two volatile commodities It would lessen its dependence on Western technology and trade On the financial front it would reduce external debt It would practise tight fiscal and monetary policy allowing it to accumulate vast amounts of foreign exchange with which it would be able to defend the rouble or that it would channel to favoured companies at times of crisisThere have been some successes Take the economy first Russia is somewhat less dependent on hydrocarbons In 2019 oil profits accounted for about 9% of GDP down from around 15% when Mr Putin took office Oligarchs remain exceptionally powerful controlling a huge share of overall Russian wealth but their influence appears to have stopped growing Between 2000 and 2019 Russia services industry grew by seven percentage points of GDP even if productivity growth in most sectors has been pitifulIn some areas Russia has developed technologies which operate independently of Western ones Mir a Russian payments system accounted for a quarter of domestic card transactions in 2020 up from nothing five years ago The share of Russian imports classed as “high-tech” seems to be falling fast World Bank data suggest In the past decade European exports of whizzy products to Russia have stagnated while growing elsewhereBut the fortress walls have gaping holes Russia remains enmeshed in the supply chain of Western ideas and technologies According to our analysis of bilateral data on stocks of long-term investment control of companies say or the construction of new factories the Russian economy is somewhat more reliant on the West than it was a decade ago About 30% of Russian imports come from G7 countries hardly different from 2014 In some industries such as chipmaking and computers Russia remains wholly dependent on American parts The cards of some Russian banks under sanction no longer work with Apple Pay or Google Pay which on February 28th caused chaos on the Moscow metro as people could not get through the turnstilesThe chaos in Russia financial markets has been an even bigger surprise After all by 2022 Russia had $630bn-worth of international reserves around 40% of GDP the most ever and had diversified away from American dollars It had also greatly reduced its foreign-denominated debt owed to foreigners since 2014But the country remains dependent on foreign investors Their short-term asset holdings including bank loans and stocks relative to GDP are about as high in Russia as they are in other emerging marketsand they have remained steady since 2014 Even without sanctions Russian assets would be under huge pressure as investors run for the exitsAnd Russia always assumed that it would be able to access foreign exchange to defend the rouble It is not completely cut off: Russia energy exports have largely escaped Western bans so it still has some dollars flowing in But because of sanctions 65% of Russia reserves may in effect be worth $0 The other 35% held in gold and yuan cannot be used to defend the currency in the dollar and euro marketsRussia difficulties will only compound over time Being shut out of the SWIFT financial-transfer system will hurt trade; SPFS a Russian-backed rival remains far less popular Russia still needs dollars to pay for a third of its imports a problem when it has suddenly become harder to get hold of them Even in its imports from China where progress has been made on “de-dollarisation” around 60% of transactions still take place using the greenbackA test from GodThe question is whether Mr Putin really cares about all this He may not welcome the prospect of angry oligarchs should some of them indeed dare to raise their voice But according to Ms Hill and Mr Gaddy book a core tenet of Putinism is survivalism where one sees economic warfare as a test of strength The pain is the point “In this narrative Russia constantly battles for survival against a hostile outside world” they say “The one critical lesson from history is that Russia the state always survives in one form or another” Russia faces a deep recession But rather than relent Mr Putin may double down on his attempts to cut Russia off from the outside world Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to avoid a

 Feb 28th 2022,The rouble collapse compounds Russia isolation,ON MONDAY as financial markets began trading in Asia the value of the Russian rouble collapsed The cause was harsh Western sanctions introduced over the weekend In effect these freeze Russia foreign currency reserves and begin to lock Russian banks out of the SWIFT network for arranging international transactions The US dollar rose by as much as 40% against the rouble taking the Russian currency from its Friday closing level of around 84 to the dollar to as high as 118 a new recordThe move will be one of the largest one-day slumps in the Russian currency modern history similar in scale to the one-day declines recorded during the worst moments of the country financial crisis in 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt In mid-morning in Moscow the Russian central bank raised its key interest rate from 95% to 20% in an effort to stem the rouble slump and the country finance ministry ordered companies with foreign-currency revenues to convert 80% of their income into roublesThe rouble collapse shows how isolated the government has become Its functional exclusion from international financial markets could do the economy grave harm A plunging currency makes imports of everything from cars to medical products dramatically more expensive External debts much of which are denominated in dollars will be more difficult to service The rouble decline will further reduce the falling quality of life for the Russian middle class and it will harm any company that has to pay for overseas goods and servicesThe country central bank has ordered financial institutions to reject the instructions of foreign clients attempting to sell Russian securities a move that may be the beginning of controls to prevent massive outflows of capital Any ban on foreign investors from getting out their money could sour what little is left of the country reputation as an investment destination Over the weekend Russian citizens queued outside banks to withdraw their money Panic about the stability of Russia financial system could yet lead to bank runsOil prices climbed higher on worries about disruptions to supply possibly because of embargoes On Monday-morning trading in Asia they rose to just short of $100 per barrel up by around 5% compared with their levels at the end of last week As a huge exporter of oil and gas Russia would usually gain from higher energy prices But the plunge of the rouble suggests that the extra revenue from commodity sales is expected to pale in comparison to the damage done by sanctionsThe spillover in other markets was muted in early trading on Monday with benchmark equity indexes in Hong Kong Shanghai and Tokyo not far from their levels at the close on Friday American and European market indices were lower but not drastically so But as investors scramble to work through the knock-on effects of the conflict for assets around the world more frenetic trading activity may yet be to comeThe threat of more severe sanctions has become increasingly real since financial markets closed for the weekend on February 26th The announcement that America Britain and the European Union would target the Russian central bank and its ability to sell its $630bn in foreign-exchange reserves much of which are held in overseas custody could frustrate Russia ability to defend the value of its currency On Monday morning the EU prohibited all transactions with the Central Bank of RussiaRussian banks’ bid-and-ask quotes for US dollarsthe prices at which a dealer will buy or sellwidened dramatically during the weekend demonstrating both uncertainty about what lies ahead and also how keen holders of dollars are to hang onto hard currency Sberbank Russia largest bank quoted a spread of around 22% between purchases and sales of dollars even before Monday enormous move in the exchange rate One week ago the spread was just 5%The Russian government has made efforts in recent years to protect itself from the full impact of any further international sanctions In 2014 the central bank established an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT called SPFS Last year it boasted that the system message volume exceeded 20% of SWIFT levels in 2020 with around 400 institutions connected to the system including several foreign companiesBut recent international sanctions mean that banks overseas will hesitate to participate in any workarounds that could violate incoming sanctions In 2020 when the American Treasury Department imposed sanctions on political and security figures in Hong Kong even Chinese banks in the territory would not hold accounts for those who had been targeted The reason is that they were fearful of losing access to dollar-denominated payment and settlementDirect exposure between the Russian financial system and the rest of the world is slim but not non-existent Banks based in Russia record $134bn in liabilities owed to institutions abroad according to data from the Bank for International Settlements around 04% of the global total Four-fifths of the country 155trn-rouble government bond market is held domestically That means there is less risk of direct financial contagion from a Russian financial crisisA handful of European banksHungary OTP Austria Raiffeisen France Société Générale and Italy UniCredithave meaningful exposure to Russia or Ukraine according to S&P global ratings a credit-rating agency But there is no obvious current equivalent to Long-Term Capital Management the American hedge fund which collapsed in 1998 as a result of highly leveraged bets on Russian government bonds threatening to take much of Wall Street with itInstead the most important effects of Russia financial distress could flow through real economic channels The rising price of oil will exacerbate inflation which has already surged in most of the Western world And Chicago wheat futures for delivery in May rose by around 7% during overnight trading to a little over $9 per bushel As a staple foodstuff across much of the world more supply disruptions will mean higher food prices too According to Rabobank a Dutch bank Russia and Ukraine account together for 30% of global wheat exports The reaction of the Federal Reserve to the market ructions adds another element of uncertainty Until the conflict erupted expectations that the Fed might signal its intention to whip inflation with a 05 percentage point interest-rate increase were growing Based on market pricing investors still expect the American central bank to raise rates at its mid-March meeting but by a more restrained 025 percentage pointsIf the weakness of the rouble endures and efforts to prevent capital from leaving the country continue the financial damage to Russian businesses and livelihoods could be lasting The diversification of Russia economy away from commodities would have been set back by years Just as Vladimir Putin Russia president has made himself a pariah by invading the country next door so the Russian economy could end up being isolated tooOur recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found

 Feb 27th 2022,How new sanctions could cripple Russia economy,EVER SINCE Russia seized Crimea in 2014 Western sanctions have failed to bite or act as a credible deterrent against Russian aggression The new measures targeting Russia financial system announced by America the EU and other allies on February 26th change that They have come too late to prevent an invasion of Ukraine but they are capable of triggering financial mayhem in Russia because they target its central bank and may lead to the freezing of its $630bn of foreign-exchange reserves This could trigger a run on Russia banks and currency and will cause shudders in global markets and a further spike in energy prices It may also trigger Russian retaliation On February 27th Russia said the sanctions were “illegitimate” and indicated that Russia nuclear forces had been put on a heightened level of alertness in response The West deployment of this economic weapon will also be watched with slack-jawed shock in China which has $34trn of reserves and which will now be rethinking how to resist Western pressure in the event of a war over TaiwanUp until now Western sanctions have been long on macho rhetoric about crushing Russia but short on clout For example the penalties on oligarchs and their offshore wealth have led some tycoons to call for an end to the bloodshed but not changed decision-making in the Kremlin Meanwhile limits on Western technology and industrial exports to Russia will take months or years to have an effect Even American sanctions announced on February 24th against Sberbank and VTB Bank which together hold 75% of the Russian banking industry assets were a serious but not killer blow particularly since energy transactions were exempted Russia “fortress” financial system looked capable of withstanding the economic weapons that the West dared to useThe salvo on February 26th goes much further Many of the headlines in America and Europe have dwelled on the decision to cut off some Russian banks probably Sberbank and VTB from SWIFT the global cross-border payments messaging system In fact the SWIFT decision is incremental rather than a game-changer It will make all counterparties not just Western ones wary of dealing with these firms If they choose to do so they will have to resort to using email and phone to communicate adding a layer of hassleInstead the really big step is to target the institution at the heart of Russia fortress economy the central bank It holds $630bn of foreign reserves equivalent to 38% of Russia GDP in 2021 the sanctions may also cover other government-run funds Officials in the Biden administration say that they acting with Europe will prevent the central bank from using these reserves to undermine the impact of sanctions As part of the fortress strategy Russia has shifted the composition of its reserves away from dollars: as of June 2021 it held only 16% in greenbacks versus 32% in euros 22% in gold and 13% in Chinese yuan However it is likely that the majority of its holdings of securities bank deposits and other instruments regardless of the currency they are denominated in are held in accounts with financial institutions or in jurisdictions that will enforce Western sanctions That means some or even much of Russia national war chest can be frozen Responding to the new measures the central bank said on February 27th that it had all necessary resources and instruments to maintain financial stability But the implications are daunting If the central bank does not have instant access to the reserves it will be hard for it to intervene in the currency market by using foreign cash to support the sagging rouble as it has done in the past few days The central bank may be unable to offer foreign-currency liquidity to banks that are under sanctions in turn increasing the probability that they may default on their foreign-currency obligations to counterparties And it will be unable to act as a middle-man for such banks making or receiving foreign payments with foreign counterparties on their behalf which is one theoretical way of evading sanctionsThat all points to an intensifying panic in Russia financial system So far the damage from the war has been severe but tolerable The currency has fallen by 10% year-to-date the stockmarket by 35% and the share prices of the biggest banks by over 50% As of February 25th the cost of insuring against a Russian government default was on a par with Turkey Now the pressure is likely to intensify Ordinary Russians may lose confidence in the banking system although providing their withdrawals are denominated in roubles the central bank can offset this by offering rouble loans to the banks Thanks to its oil earnings Russia runs a current-account surplus earning more from abroad than it buys from abroad But if there is panic and capital flight without access to its reserves it could be forced to introduce tight capital controls to prevent a currency collapse It may also choose to temporarily close the financial markets short-selling of shares has already been bannedSo far while there have been some signs of Chinese banks steering clear of dollar-denominated transactions with Russian firms there has been little sign that China or many other Asian countries intend to enforce Western sanctions But now with a higher risk of default on foreign-currency obligations by Russian banks firms and the government all of their counterparties not just Western ones will be more wary of them The new measures are sufficiently severe that they may be treated by Russia as something close to an act of war and lead to it retaliating On February 27th it said that it had put its nuclear forces on a “special regime of duty” which means a heightened level of alertness This is designed to signal that the Kremlin does not believe that there is a neat boundary between economic and conventional warfare The West may now have to alter its nuclear posture in response There are other ways for Russia to retaliate One path is intensifying cyber-attacks on Western institutions Another is for it to limit gas supplies to Europe Up until February 25th the supply of gas from Gazprom through Ukraine had been boosted back to normal levels according to Bloomberg But Russia could now taper down supply This would have only a moderate financial impact on Russia oil exports are far more important to its economy but would lead to higher energy prices and consumer bills in Europe In this scenario the West would still have other economic weapons with which to escalate including blocks on consumer internet services or sanctions on Russian oil Whether the West newfound resolve succeeds in inflicting a devastating blow on Russia economy before Russia inflicts a devastating military blow on Ukraine remains to be seen But the new measures will inflict heavy damage on Russia And they also represent a rubicon that will fundamentally alter how sanctions and the global economy work That is because plenty of other countries that pursue foreign policies that America does not agree with hold large sums of reserves The largest of all is China much of whose vast savings are held in Western financial instruments or through Western firms It will be watching and learning from Russia financial squeeze and how Russia retaliates and trying to assess how it can avoid becoming crushed by the West financial vice Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories

 Feb 26th 2022,America tariff wall on Chinese imports looks increasingly like Swiss cheese,“AN EASY WAY to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA It very simple!” In the days when Twitter was the main medium for presidential proclamations that was what Donald Trump recommended to companies using China as a manufacturing base He was half right: avoiding tariffs has proved to be quite simple What he failed to see though was that avoidance is an eminently viable strategy for companies staying put in ChinaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scale of avoidance is to use a non-technical term huge A giant discrepancy that has opened up between Chinese and American trade data provides a window onto the tariff-dodging that has occurred over the past three years since America slapped duties on Chinese products Much of it involves importers taking advantage of legal loopholes; some of it appears to be outright evasion with companies lying to customs inspectorsThe numbers add up quickly: the total value of made-in-China goods entering America and dodging tariffs may have surpassed $100bn in 2021 according to calculations by The Economist Taken alone these goods would be equivalent to America fourth-largest source of imports even outstripping its purchases from Japan and Germany Moreover if all these goods were counted properly America bilateral goods-trade deficit with China would have smashed its annual record in 2021a damning indictment of the use of tariffs as a way to narrow the trade gap with ChinaTo understand the discrepancy start with the official American trade data According to figures released on February 8th America bought $506bn of goods from China last year That was up by 16% from 2020 a reflection of America booming consumption but still below its import peak reached in 2018 The Chinese trade data are starkly different They show that America bought $576bn of goods from China last year up by nearly 30% from 2020 far and away the most on recordThis gap is particularly striking because the historical pattern is for China to systematically underestimate its exports to America by roughly 18% One reason for the historical underestimate is that China classifies many products shipped via Hong Kong as exports to Hong Kong whereas America counts them as imports from China If the 18% underestimate rule of thumb still applies China exports to America may have reached as much as $680bn last year $174bn more than reported by AmericaThe obvious question to ask is why anyone should privilege China data with its reputation for manipulation over American data In other words perhaps America has counted its purchases from China correctly while China has overstated its sales to America Last year two economists then with the Federal Reserve Hunter Clark and Anna Wong explored this possibility trying to account for the data discrepancyPart of the problem they found did indeed stem from the Chinese side To blunt the impact of the trade war with America China dramatically increased tax rebates for its exports which in turn encouraged exporters to declare more overseas shipments But in working through the trade data for 2020 their conclusion was that the tax changes explained just about 14% of the discrepancy while tariff avoidance explained 62% it was hard to pin down a specific reason for the remainder If the same proportions applied to the trade data for 2021 tariff avoidance would have reached $108bn nearly double the amount in 2020 And there is reason to think it may be even higher: in 2021 China actually decreased some of its tax rebates for exporters whereas those trying to get around America tariffs will only have become more adept at doing soWhat are the tricks of the trade? One approach is to exploit what is known as the “de minimis” rule According to this countries neither charge duties on nor collect full data on imports below a certain value Most developed countries set the threshold at around $200 In 2016 eager to focus scarce customs resources on high-value shipments America lifted its bar to $800 providing importers with ample scope to avoid tariffs Over the 12 months to September 2021 American customs officials counted that 7715m de minimis packages entered the countrya fifth more than during the previous periodwith no estimate of their actual value Some logistics companies now offer services to American importers letting them make bulk shipments to Mexico or Canada and then break them into smaller packages for tariff-free entry into AmericaSome firms may also be evading tariffs by presenting false information to customs inspectors In their paper Mr Clark and Ms Wong noted that American importers could use “low-ball invoices supplied by their Chinese suppliers” There also appears to have been an increase in goods produced in China but falsely labelled as originating from other countries Since 2016 the Customs and Border Protection a federal agency has published a record of its investigations into potential evasions of anti-dumping duties Over the past two years it has launched 37 such investigations up from 24 over the previous three years Virtually all have targeted products from China In January for example customs investigators determined that Simpli Home a furniture company had imported quartz products from China but incorrectly claimed they were from Vietnam In December they found that A&A Pharmachem a supplier of drug ingredients had trans-shipped China-produced xanthan gum through India to avoid tariffsWith tighter rules and closer checks at the border America could stop some of this tariff avoidance Earl Blumenauer a Democratic congressman from Oregon introduced a bill last monthaimed squarely at Chinathat would prevent companies from non-market economies from using the de minimis loophole If customs agents were to open more shipping containers and sift through them carefully they might identify more understated invoices and more mislabelled countries of origin But doing so would require expertise and timeall the more difficult when ports are suffering from backlogs Officials want to speed shipments up not slow them down with yet more inspectionsIndeed America can be at least somewhat grateful for all of the tariff avoidance Duties at the border ultimately act as a tax on American consumers pushing up prices for imported products At a time when inflation is running high tariff-dodging helps to keep costs down For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 26th 2022,The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine,OVER THE past decade intensifying geopolitical risk has been a constant feature of world politics yet the world economy and financial markets have shrugged it off From the contest between China and America to the rise of populist rulers in Latin America and tensions in the Middle East firms and investors have carried on regardless judging that the economic consequences will be containedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia invasion of Ukraine is likely to break this pattern because it will result in the isolation of the world 11th-largest economy and one of its largest commodity producers The immediate global implications will be higher inflation lower growth and some disruption to financial markets as deeper sanctions take hold The longer-term fallout will be a further debilitation of the system of globalised supply chains and integrated financial markets that has dominated the world economy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991Start with the commodity shock As well as being the dominant supplier of gas to Europe Russia is one of the world largest oil producers and a key supplier of industrial metals such as nickel aluminium and palladium Both Russia and Ukraine are major wheat exporters while Russia and Belarus a Russian proxy are big in potash an input into fertilisers The prices of these commodities have been rising this year and are now likely to rise further Amid reports of explosions across Ukraine the price of Brent oil breached $100 per barrel on the morning of February 24th and European gas prices rose by 30%The supply of commodities could be damaged in one of two ways Their delivery might be disrupted if physical infrastructure such as pipelines or Black Sea ports are destroyed Alternatively deeper sanctions on Russia commodity complex could prevent Western customers from buying from it Up until now both sides have been wary about weaponising the trade in energy and commodities which continued throughout the cold war Sanctions after the invasion of Crimea did not prevent BP ExxonMobil or Shell from investing in Russia while American penalties on Rusal a Russian metals firm in 2018 were short-lived Germany decision to mothball the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on February 22nd was largely symbolic since it does not yet carry gas from Russia to the WestNonetheless the prospect now is of more Western restrictions on Russia natural-resources industry that curtail global supply Russia may retaliate by deliberately creating bottlenecks that raise prices America may lean on Saudi Arabia to increase oil production and prod its domestic shale firms to ramp up outputThe second shock relates to tech and the global financial system While the trade in natural resources is an area of mutual dependency between the West and Russia in finance and tech the balance of economic power is more one-sided America is thus likely to put much tougher Huawei-style sanctions on Russian tech firms limiting their access to cutting-edge semiconductors and software and also blacklist Russia largest two banks Sberbank and VTB or seek to cut Russia off from the SWIFT messaging system that is used for cross-border bank transfersThe tech measures will act as a drag on Russia growth over time and annoy its consumers The banking restrictions will bite immediately causing a funding crunch and impeding financial flows in and out of the country Russia has sought to insulate its economy from precisely this: the share of its invoices denominated in dollars has slumped since its invasion of Crimea in 2014 and it has built up foreign-exchange reserves Still it will hurt Russia will turn to China for its financial needs Already trade between the two countries has been insulated from Western sanctions with only 33% of payments from China to Russia now taking place in dollars down from 97% in 2014Western banks appear to have fairly low exposure to Russia Nonetheless since the modern era of globalisation began in the 1990s no major economy has been cut off from the global financial system and the risk of broader contagion across markets while apparently low cannot be ruled outWhat does all this mean for the global economy? Russia faces a serious but not fatal economic shock as its financial system is isolated For the global economy the prospect is of higher inflation as natural-resource prices rise intensifying the dilemma that central banks face and a possible muting of corporate investment as jittery markets dampen confidenceThe longer-term impact will be to accelerate the division of the world into economic blocs Russia will be forced to tilt east relying more on trade and financial links with China In the West more politicians and firms will ask if a key tenet of globalisationthat you should trade with everyone not just your geopolitical alliesis still valid not just for Russia but other autocracies China will look at Western sanctions on Russia and conclude that it needs to intensify its campaign of self-sufficiency The invasion of Ukraine might not cause a global economic crisis today but it will change how the world economy operates for decades to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterOur recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found here
 Feb 26th 2022,How to avoid a fatal backlash against globalisation,IN 1920 JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES reflected on the Britain he knew before the outbreak of the first world war “The inhabitant of London” he wrote “could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth” Keynes Londoner “regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent” and not long ago the globalisation of the present age seemed a similarly inexorable force A new world war remains unlikely but the uncomfortable echoes of the past in recent history suggest that a closer look at the rise and retreat of 19th-century globalisation might yield valuable lessonsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA work of economic history published in 1999 provides a great starting point “Globalisation and History” by Kevin O’Rourke and Jeffrey Williamson hit shelves at a time of growing unease about the effects of deepening economic integration Then anti-trade activists swarmed meetings of the World Trade Organisation while a few economists began to draw attention to the occasionally troubling distributional effects of globalisation It roared on nonetheless over the first decade after the book publication But in the years since economic nationalism has become a potent political force and the book has come to seem eerily prescientNineteenth-century integration began in earnest around mid-century after decades of instability and insularity Liberalised trade rules helped; Britain repealed its Corn Lawstariffs on imported grainin 1846 But the integration of markets was supercharged by improvements in communication and transport technologies which allowed for faster cheaper and more reliable movement of people goods and information The telegraph steamships and railways brought the economies of Europe and the Americas into close contact with profound consequences In the new world land was abundant and cheap and wages were high The reverse was true in Europe where workers were plentiful and landowners collected fat rents As these markets integrated prices converged In 1870 British wheat prices were 60% above those in America; by 1890 the gap had mostly closed When telegraph cables connected distant financial markets differences in the pricing of various securities vanished almost immediatelySimple trade theory predicts that as differences in the prices of traded goods shrink the cost of factors of production like land and labour should likewise converge Experience in the 19th century bore this out As waves of American grain spilled into European ports land prices in Europe tumbled toward those across the pond In America the real price of land tripled between 1870 and 1913 while in Britain it dropped by nearly 60% Real wages converged as well although the authors note this owed more to migration than trade Nineteenth-century migrant flows were unlike anything in recent memory Between 1870 and 1910 they reduced Sweden labour force by 20% relative to what it otherwise would have been and increased America by 24% These flows transformed labour markets Real wages earned by unskilled labourers in Ireland rose from roughly 60% of the British level in the 1840s to 90% in 1914 thanks entirely to Irish emigrationHow much can really be learned from such a different world? Today migration matters much less than it did in the 19th century Skilled workers account for a far larger share of rich-world workforces and are protected by modern regulations and social safety-nets Trade consists not only of bulk commodity shipments but of components imported and exported multiple times along complex supply chains Forget telegraphs; in meetings today people chat face-to-face with colleagues on other continentsYet a number of lessons appear relevant Start with the issue of convergence in incomes across countries Much of modern theorising about convergence focuses on the role of capital accumulation and technological progress Poor countries grow rich in these models because they invest more and adopt more sophisticated technologies But in the 19th century the integration of markets drove convergence: a force which has also been at work in recent decades The narrowing gap between American and Chinese wages is in part a story of Chinese technological progress Yet it is also one in which hundreds of millions of Chinese workers began participating in a global economy making low-skilled labour more abundant globally and contributing to weaker blue-collar wage growth and higher inequality in rich countriesSecond people in the 19th century generally understood the effects that trade and migration had on their economies and those on the losing end sought political solutions to their troubles Then as now training and education were touted as answers to the problems of unhappy workers But moves to improve schooling were accompanied by a broad shift towards protectionism From the 1870s European economies with the notable exception of Britain began raising tariff rates Over the same period migration policy in the Americas became ever more restrictiveDon’t spoil the endingSo it has gone this time too Work by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and three co-authors found that American counties which were more exposed to imports from China became more likely to vote Republican in presidential elections for example: a shift which in 2016 helped to elect a trade-warring presidentAnd yet third and most important it was not higher tariff barriers or restrictions on migration which plunged the world into the deep and destructive insularity that took hold after 1914; it was war But for war the retreat of globalisation a century ago may have remained modest and short-lived The same may be true today If inattention to the distributional effects of trade can prompt a backlash then a greater commitment to sharing the bounty generated by openness might permit a renewal of economic integrationif the world remains willing to learn from the past Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A new history of sanctions has unsettling lessons for today Feb 19thThe promise of former eastern-bloc economies is mostly unfulfilled Feb 12thChina may soon become a high-income country Feb 5thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 26th 2022,The many virtues of the yen the rich world cheapest currency,THE LAST shall be first and the first last An emerging theme in capital markets is that securities that generated bumper returns in the era of low inflation sluggish demand and zero interest ratesthink American tech stocksare under pressure while assets that fared horribly in the 2010s oil mining and bank stocks are holding up well If it is cheap inflation-proof and formerly unloved capital is now increasingly drawn to itListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis brings us to the yen the forgotten currency of the least inflation-prone big economy JapanIt once had a solid reputation as a haven like the Swiss franc or the American dollar Whenever a storm blew up the yen rallied But not recently In the volatile weeks since the start of 2022 the yen has mostly moved sideways against the dollar Even Russia invasion of Ukraine did not immediately change its course The yen is a cheap currency that keeps on getting cheaper Its cheapness now looks like an obvious virtueJapan remains the world largest creditor Its net foreign assetswhat its residents own abroad minus what they owe to foreignersamount to around $35trn almost 70% of Japan annual GDP Some of those assets are fixed investments such as factories and office buildings But a chunk is held in bank deposits and in shares and bonds which can be liquidated quicklyIn past periods of high stress such as during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 capital was pulled back into Japan by nervous investors The upshot was an appreciating yen In some instances the effect was dramatic In October 1998 as the crisis surrounding LTCM a busted hedge fund came to a head the yen appreciated from 136 to 112 against the dollar in a matter of days It is rallies such as this that gave the yen its safe-haven reputation When trouble struck you followed the Japanese moneyThis has not worked so reliably lately An important change came with the re-election of Abe Shinzo as prime minister in December 2012 and the subsequent appointment of Kuroda Haruhiko as governor of Japan central bank A key goal of “Abenomics” was to banish Japan chronic deflation through the use of radical monetary policy including huge central-bank purchases of bonds and equities A result of all the sustained money-printing was a much weaker yen but not much stronger inflation The yen safe-haven status wore off says Peter Tasker a seasoned observer of Japan economy and marketsMight it be restored? In a world in which inflation is a serious concern there is a lot to be said for a currency which holds its purchasing power The yen is now very cheap in real terms against a broad basket of other currencies On a measure calculated by the Bank for International Settlements the yen is now more competitive than at any time since the series began in 1994 The Economist Big Mac Index a light-hearted gauge of purchasing power tells a similar story The exchange rate required to equalise the price of a Big Mac in Tokyo and New York is 67; but the yen currently trades at 115 to the dollar On this basis the yen is undervalued by 42% Even if the yen continues to trade sideways it is likely to become cheaper in real terms Japan inflation rate is currently just 05% America is 75%In the near term risk aversion and rising interest rates in America will support the dollar But the more the Federal Reserve has to do to contain inflation the greater the risk of a hard landing for America economy The dollar might eventually find itself at the centre of a storm In such a scenario the yen would rally strongly Kit Juckes of Société Générale a French bank sees a risk that dollar-yen falls below 100 in the next year or two Traders might wait for signs of trouble in America economy before buying For those who want exposure now Japan stockmarket has appeal It too is cheap: it trades on 136 times expected earnings And for cautious souls looking for a cheap segment of a cheap market in a cheap currency Japan banks offer a dividend yield of 4% and trade on a single-digit multiple of expected earningsThe tides are shifting Not so long ago many investors were fearful of “Japanification” in which economies got stuck in too low a gear to stop prices and bond yields from falling But now inflation is roaring back and interest rates are on the rise In a world turning upside-down the yen old-fashioned virtues ought to jog the memoryRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Are financial crossbreeds monstrosities or labradoodles?
