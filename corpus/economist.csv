 Jan 26th 2023,Have economists misunderstood inflation?,Imagine it is late 2024 Inflation in the rich world has fallen from its peak but stayed stubbornly high At around 4% it is well above the level at which most central banks are comfortable Governments weighed down by vast debts must use precious revenues to pay interest on the debt which itself is growing because of high interest rates The energy transition and rising state spending owing to ageing populations add to the fiscal largesse Raising taxes is politically fraught so more money is printed Inflation stays high and governments’ credibility worsens Central bankers are scratching their heads wondering how their powerful weaponthe interest ratehas failed so thoroughlyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA wonkish theory laid out in glorious detail in a new book by John Cochrane of Stanford University Hoover Institution would offer a potential explanation “The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level” builds a theory of inflation as ambitious as that proposed by John Maynard Keynes “The General Theory” or Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz “A Monetary History” Mr Cochrane whose own work on the subject spans four decades spends nearly 600 pages reworking the maths of past economic models to incorporate fiscal theory while chattily discussing how it explains past inflationary episodes “[E]ven Milton Friedman might change his mind with new facts and experience at hand” he speculatesAt the heart of Mr Cochrane theory is the idea that government debt can be valued like a firm equity based on the returns to its owner pockets The price level will adjustand therefore drive inflation or deflationto ensure that the real value of the debt equals the sum of a government future budget surpluses appropriately discounted Thus the true driver of inflation is government debt not monetary policy Under this theory money is valuable because it can be used to pay tax and generate surpluses The set-up is not all that different from the gold standard except it is tax rather than gold that backs money Mr Cochrane is careful to note that the adjustment of the price level is not instantaneous People can be poor judges of a government credibility when it comes to paying off debts Just like stocks prices are able to deviate from fundamentals Yet in the long run they adjust A government that hands out money without eventually running surpluses will not avoid inflation for ever History appears to offer support Brad DeLong of the University of California Berkeley uses fiscal theory in his recent book “Slouching towards Utopia” to explain inflation in post-first-world-war Europe In France hefty debt-interest payments led to an average of 20% annual inflation over seven years In Germany things were worse The public lost faith in the ability of the state to pay off its debts without inflation Soon hyperinflation kicked in Mr Cochrane also brings fiscal theory to bear on America inflation in the 1970s-80s In the mid-1970s price rises exceeded 12% The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates; inflation dropped to 5% by 1977 Yet Mr Cochrane points out that inflation shot up again to more than 14% by 1980 in part because America failed to get its fiscal house in order Fiscal and regulatory reforms that raised expectations of future surpluses along with another dose of monetary medicine were needed to vanquish inflationHow is fiscal theory faring today? For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 prices stayed stubbornly low despite a ballooning supply of money and interest rates sitting at or below zero in much of the rich world A “crude monetarism” predicted an inflationary surge which did not materialise Other revamped “New Keynesian” models also proved unhelpful When governments spent big during the covid-19 pandemic many economists reasoning from recent history were sanguine about the possibility of inflationMr Cochrane argues fiscal theory can explain both the period of low inflation and the return of rapidly rising prices after the pandemic Inflation was meagre in the 2010s despite soaring government debts because politicians promised to get their books in order and low interest rates meant consumers and bondholders were willing to wait Yet during the pandemic governments took a different approach They dropped enormous cheques into consumers’ pockets The Fed purchased government debt immediately after its issuance There was little talk of sustainability Mr Cochrane argues that the direct nature of these “helicopter drops” informed people their newly fat pockets would not be drained by future taxes Thus they were more willing to spendHeads I win tails you loseThis story is perhaps too convenient Indeed Mr Cochrane admits that fiscal theory flaw is it offers a way of explaining nearly any series of historical events in an unfalsifiable manner Yes other theories of inflation have problems But if it is so hard to prove fiscal theory wrong are they really in a fair fight? Mr Cochrane story of how inflation ended in the 1980s is complicated by the fact that America actually cut taxes suggesting politicians were not all that concerned by balanced budgets Although deregulation may have boosted growth many economists think the budget surpluses of the 1990s were mainly caused by globalisation and an it boom which few consumers in the 1980s saw comingFiscal theory also offers limited guidance to policymakers beyond what is already well-known Under its approach monetary policy remains important: interest rates can spread out an increase in the price level over a period of time In addition the theory suggests governments must maintain credibility when it comes to paying off their debtshardly a radical idea Fast-forward once again to late 2024 Imagine this time inflation has fallen to 2% Interest rates are slowly coming down Central bankers are running a victory lap What of fiscal theory?

 Jan 26th 2023,What inflation means for the Big Mac index,For much of the past two years economists have argued fiercely about prices As inflation in America and elsewhere has exceeded central-bank targets analysts have dissected different components of the cost of living including the prices of goods services energy and rents Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut what about the Big Mac? The iconic McDonald burger is an amalgam of rent electricity and labour as well as beef bread and cheese Its price is therefore indicative of broader inflationary pressures And because the burger is basically the same wherever you are in the world its price can also reveal how inflation has changed the relative costliness of different countriesIn America for example the median price of a Big Mac has risen by more than 6% to an average of $536 in the past two years The price tends to be a bit higher in big cities According to the theory of purchasing-power parity when a country prices rise its currency should fall everything else equal This stops the country prices moving too far out of line with those elsewhere in the world Yet the dollar has risen not fallen over the past two years against the currencies of most other big economies A trade-weighted exchange-rate index published by America Federal Reserve increased by more than 9% from December 2020 to December 2022 One reason for this is that inflation has also returned to lots of America trading partners Indeed in many places it is worse Big Mac prices have risen by 14% over the past two years in the euro area and by 15% in Britain But the dollar rise against the euro and pound has been more than required to offset this inflation gapThe combination of rising prices and a rising currency threatens to move American prices out of whack with those elsewhere in the world Two years ago for example the Big Mac was 26% cheaper in Japan than America In principle this suggests the yen was undervalued and should have risen against the dollar In fact the opposite occurred A Big Mac is now more than 40% cheaper in Japan There are exceptions where the theory of purchasing-power parity has held Although Argentina peso has fallen against the dollar prices in the country have risen even faster A Big Mac now costs the equivalent of $531 That is high compared with the price two years ago and also compared with today price in Brazil $444 If the two Latin American countries were to form a currency union at today exchange rate Argentina would find itself at a hefty competitive disadvantage It would be almost 20% more expensive than its larger neighbour at least judging by burger pricesThe Economist has been making comparisons of this kind since 1986 Converting Big Mac prices into dollars always reveals big differences in the cost of the same burger in different countries One measure of the “fair value” of a currency is the exchange rate that would eliminate these gaps But of course exchange rates are not the only thing that can adjust Prices can also rise faster in one country than another In the long era of low inflation this was not where the action was Over the past two years prices have been on the move in many countries Unfortunately these bouts of inflation have done little to move burger prices closer together For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 26th 2023,When professional stockpickers beat the algorithms,Last year plunging markets left few investors smiling Stocks and bonds fell in tandem; haven assets failed to offer safe harbour Doing well meant making single-figure percentage losses rather than double It might therefore seem an odd time for fund managers to be walking with a spring in their step Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut on January 23rd it emerged that Citadel a secretive investment firm based in Miami had generated $16bn in net profits for its clients in 2022 breaking the record for the largest annual gain in dollar terms Its main hedge fund posted a 38% returnwhile msci broadest index of global stocks declined by 18% Champagne corks were popping elsewhere too Strategas Securities a brokerage and research firm reckons that 62% of active fund managers investing in large American firms beat the s&p 500 index of such shares in 2022 the highest percentage since 2005 Last year therefore snapped a miserable losing streak for stockpickers Every year from 2010 to 2021 more than half of active managers who benchmarked their performance against the s&p 500 failed to beat it In other words the average fund manager was outclassed by a simple algorithm blindly buying every stock in the index Such algorithmsknown as “passive” or “index” fundsare taking over By 2021 they held 43% of the assets managed by American investment companies and owned a greater share of the country stockmarket than their actively managed counterpartsThe logic that drives passive funds is inescapable By definition the performance of an index is the average of those who own the underlying stocks Beating an index is a zero-sum game If one investor does another must lose out Active managers may spot a superstar stock that ends up leaving the rest in the dust But it will also be in the index so passive investors will buy it too Meanwhile active managers tend to charge fees that are orders of magnitude higher than passive ones: often 1-2% a year and more for whizzy hedge funds compared with as little as 003% for their algorithmic peers This drag on performance makes it all but inevitable that index funds will outpace human money managers in the long runSo how did fund managers outperform in 2022? One possibility is sheer luck Pick a group of stocks from an index at random subtract a percentage point or two from their returns for fees and occasionally you will have chosen shares that do well enough to beat the averageA variation on this allows for some skill on the stockpicker part At the start of 2022 Alphabet Amazon Apple Microsoft and Tesla accounted for nearly a quarter of the total market capitalisation of the s&p 500 Their collective value dropped by 38% over the year; that of the rest of the index dropped by just 15% So concentrated was the index that a single good judgmentthinking the shares of America tech giants were frothy and to be avoidedwould have left a stockpicker with a decent chance of beating the marketBroadening out this tech queasiness to a more general worry about stock valuations would have given stockpickers a second chance to outperform Quibbling about such things went out of fashion during the years of cheap money that followed the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and then covid-19 Share prices soared to eye-watering multiples of the underlying companies’ earnings or assets then kept climbing Those who took that as a signal to shun them in anticipation of a correction lost out Passive funds that indiscriminately bought everything including stocks which seemed overpriced prospered But in 2022 rising interest rates brought the trend to an abrupt halt Investors who had hunted for stocks that were cheap relative to their fundamentals were at last rewardedFor firms like Citadel a final chance to prove their worth came from plummeting share and bond prices Market crashes and an uncertain economic backdrop are the raison d’être for hedge funds with a mandate to invest in any asset class they wish Stockmarket indices that are falling by double digits are a lot easier to beat if you aren’t obliged to buy stocks as are the funds which track the market And for the most nimble managers last year crises looked like opportunities As a convulsing sovereign-debt market forced British pension funds into fire-sales in September Apollo a private-investment firm started snapping up assets to book a quick profit Index funds are not going away and nor should they But just occasionally active managers are worth their feesRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Venture capital $300bn question Jan 18thThe dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

fallen by 7% a sign that fear about the global economy is ebbing Even bitcoin has had a good year Not long ago it felt as though a global recession was nailed on Now optimism is re-emerging Listen to

lower gas prices bye-bye recession” cheered analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank on January 18th in a report on the euro zone Nomura a Japanese lender has revised its forecast of Britain recession “to something less pernicious [than] what we originally expected” Citigroup another bank said that “the probability of a full-blown global recession in which growth in many countries turns down in tandem is now roughly 30% [in contrast with] the 50% assessment that we maintained through the second half of last year” These are crumbs: the world economy is weaker than at any point since the lockdowns of 2020 But investors will eat anything Forecasters are in part responding to real-time economic data Despite talk of a global recession since at least last February when Russia invaded Ukraine these have held up better than expected Consider a weekly estimate of gdp from the oecd a group of mostly rich countries which account for about 60% of global output It is hardly booming but in mid-January few countries were struggling see chart 1 Widely watched “purchasing-manager index” measures of global output rose slightly in January consistent with gdp growth of about 2%Official numbers remain mixed Recent figures on American retail and industry came in below expectations In Japan machinery orders were far weaker than forecast Yet after reaching an all-time low in the summer consumer confidence across the oecd has risen Shortly after we went to press officials were due to publish their first estimate of America gdp in the fourth quarter of 2022 Most economists were expecting a decent number though pandemic disruptions mean these figures will be less reliable than normal Labour markets seem to be holding up too In some rich countries including Austria and Denmark joblessness is risinga telltale sign that a recession is looming Barely a day goes by without an announcement from another big technology company that it is letting people go Yet tech accounts for a small share of overall jobs and in most countries unemployment remains low Happily in places where demand for labour is dropping employers are withdrawing job adverts rather than sacking people We estimate that since reaching an all-time high of more than 30m early last year unfilled vacancies across the oecd have fallen by about 10% Meanwhile the number of people actually in a job has fallen by less than 1% from its peak Investors pay attention to labour markets but they really care about right now is inflation It is too soon to know if this threat has passed In the rich world “core” inflation a measure of underlying pressure is still 5-6% year on year far higher than central banks find comfortable The problem though is no longer getting worse In America core inflation is coming down as is the share of small firms which plan to raise prices Another measure from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a data firm and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations It also seems to be dropping see chart 2 Two factors explain why the global economy has held up better than expected: energy prices and private-sector finances Last year the cost of fuel in the rich world rose by well over 20%and by 60% or more in parts of Europe Economists expected prices to remain high in 2023 crushing energy-intensive sectors such as heavy industry They were wrong Helped by unseasonably warm weather companies have proved unexpectedly flexible when it comes to dealing with high costs In November German industrial gas consumption was 27% lower than normal yet industrial production was only 05% down on the year before And over the Christmas period European natural-gas prices fell by half to levels last seen before Russia invaded Ukraine see chart 3 The strength of private-sector finances has also made a difference Our best guess is that families in the g7 are sitting on “excess” savingsie those above and beyond what you would expect them to have accumulated in normal timesof around $3trn or about 10% of annual consumer spending accumulated through a combination of pandemic stimulus and lower outlays in 2020-21 As a result although companies’ quarterly earnings in America suggest spending is faltering it is not falling off a cliff Consumers can weather higher prices and a higher cost of credit Businesses meanwhile are still sitting on large cash piles And few face large debt repayments right now: $600bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt will mature this year compared with $900bn due in 2025Can the data continue to beat expectations? There is evidence including in a recent paper by Goldman Sachs a bank that the heaviest drag from tighter monetary policy occurs after about nine months Financial conditions started really tightening nine months ago If the theory holds then the economy soon might be on surer footing even as higher rates eat away at inflation China is another reason for cheer Although removing domestic covid-19 restrictions slowed the economy in December as people hid from the virus scrapping “zero-covid” will ultimately raise global demand for goods and services The pessimistic case however remains strong Central banks have a long way to go before they can be certain that inflation is under control especially with China reopening pushing up commodity prices America forward-looking indicators are getting bleaker In addition an economy on the cusp of recession is unpredictable Once people start to lose jobs and cut spending predicting the depths of a downturn becomes hard And a crucial lesson from recent years is that if something can go wrong it often does But it is nice to have a glimmer of hope all the same For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

country officials are currently redesigning policy on a vast scale The government has abandoned its “zero-covid” approach to the pandemic while simultaneously signalling an end to a crackdown on technology firms Policymakers are also trying to rescue the property industry After two years of forcing developers to deleveragewhich has pushed dozens to default on debtsregulators are now

exact contents of the government reforms remain murky On January 13th officials produced a draft 21-point plan which stated that the aim was to provide liquidity to “good-quality” developers The task now is to differentiate between these companies and bad ones: no clear definition has been given of what constitutes good quality The plan will also push policy banks to grant loans for stalled projects and state-owned asset managers to provide credit for mergers and acquisitions Commercial banks which had pulled back from property have been told to start lending to reliable developers once

 Jan 19th 2023,Could Europe end up with a worse inflation problem than America?,Inflation is coming down On both sides of the Atlantic falling energy costs are provoking sighs of relief Price-watchers are now focused on core inflation a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices and is usually much slower to riseand more difficult to bring down Since October core inflation in the euro zone has been higher than in America Could Europeans end up with a worse inflation problem than their transatlantic peers?

multitaskOKEvery economist knows Milton Friedman dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” But the Nobel-prizewinner words do not seem to capture the current bout of inflation where post-pandemic supply disruptions fiscal splurges an energy shock and labour shortages have created a near-perfect storm causing prices to soar How fast inflation comes down may therefore depend not only on what central banks do but on how these factorsthe disruptions energy shock and wage risesaffect economies on either side of the AtlanticAlongside these surprises there has been extraordinary tumult in the basic operations of rich-world economies Covid-19 altered how people work what they consume and where they live and did so in short order Removing pandemic restrictions then led to a surge in demand for travel nights out and treats On top of this governments in America and Europe have decided to subsidise green technologies on an unprecedented scale Capital production inputs and workers need to move to parts of the economy that are growing and away from those that are shrinking Until they do the economy cannot produce enough to meet demandYet moving jobs or investing in new plants or software takes time A boom accelerates the process Recent work by Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and colleagues shows that workers in Germany are more likely to change jobs when demand is high than during recessions Another study using American data suggests that moving to a growing firm increases pay for the job-switching worker substantially The current shifts in the economy are therefore likely to produce some inflationand that may be desirable A recent paper by Veronica Guerrieri of the University of Chicago and colleagues argues that monetary policy should tolerate somewhat higher inflation if doing so allows workers to find a new job during periods of economic changeGovernment policies in America and Europe have affected the pace of adjustment to these changes Europe approach was generally to try to freeze things in place during the pandemic The continent governments created generous furlough schemes which kept workers in their existing jobs Unlike America there was no boom in durable-goods consumption financed by stimulus cheques that required expanded production Nor did Europe run its economy hot to aid a reallocation of workers and capital If inflation in America is the result of an economic reshuffle it may come down faster than Europe once that process is complete Europe also had to cope with a different economic hit Julian di Giovanni of the Federal Reserve and colleagues show that compared with America supply crunches accounted for a greater share of inflation in 2020-21 Wholesale gas and electricity prices began to rise in autumn 2021 and soared after Russia invaded Ukraine with oil and coal prices following This added much more to inflation in energy-importing Europe than it did in America The consensus in economics is that central banks should not tighten policy too much in response to a temporary supply or energy shock Coping with such a shock is hard enoughno need to give the screw another turn The effects should subside over time so long as inflation expectations stay stable Now that supply crunches in everything from lumber to chips are easing and energy prices are coming down Europe should benefit more than America That is if inflation has not become entrenched Inflation gets baked into economies when workers and firms come to believe that prices will keep rising In the worst-case scenario this creates a wage-price spiral with workers and firms unable to agree on a division of the economic pie In a tight flexible labour market like America which has little collective bargaining wage growth should quickly track inflation And that is what happened: wage growth accelerated when inflation began to rise As a new paper by Guido Lorenzoni of Northwestern University and Ivan Werning of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues this theoretically increases the risk of a wage-price spiral But America seems to have made it past the point of greatest danger According to Indeed a hiring website the country wage growth though high has been coming down for a while Blessed unionsIn Europe wages are often decided in collective-bargaining agreements Across the eu around six in ten workers are covered by such arrangements Deals typically last a year or more meaning that wages take time to adjust to economic conditions That was great when inflation got going Wage pressures did not immediately add to inflation Unions and firms could negotiate about how to divide the blow to incomes and profits After all the two sides meet at the same table every year to take stock and adjust Since they cover large chunks of the economy they have reason to take the macroeconomic effects of any deal into accountBut relations are feeling the strain With inflation in Europe stubbornly high unions are demanding extra compensation for their members Germany public-sector outfits are seeking a 105% increase in the latest round of bargaining Such delayed increases in pay are a normal feature of an economy where wages take time to adjust and which has been hit by a supply shock As Messrs Lorenzoni and Werning

 Jan 19th 2023,China re-globalisation paradox,At the annual World Economic Forum meeting this week in Davos Switzerland China economic tsar Liu He met a number of “old friends” he had not seen during his country long battle with covid-19 In a solicitous speech he acknowledged the importance of in-person meetings lamented the fragmentation of the world and called for economic “re-globalisation” In a philosophical aside he also emphasised the “duality” of things Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina recently abandoned “zero-covid” policy cut the country off from the rest of the world contributing to the fragmentation Mr Liu bemoaned But China period of isolation had a notable duality of its own Although the movement of people across China borders was sharply curtailed the movement of goods from China to the rest of the world was spectacular Despite all the disruptions China exports grew by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 and by another 7% in 2022 according to figures released on January 13th Perhaps in-person meetings are overratedChina episodic lockdowns proved less damaging to trade than feared at the time When Shanghai was brought to a standstill in April and May many worried it would clog international supply chains and push up global inflation But a lot of trade passed through nearby Ningbo instead An index of global supply-chain pressure created by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York peaked at the end of 2021 before China fraught battles with Omicron last year The index decline since then was interrupted by the Shanghai lockdown and Russia invasion of Ukraine but not for long see chart Prices tell a similar story In June when the headline inflation rate in the United States peaked at 91% the average price of Chinese imports into America rose by only 33% compared with a year earlier With the abrupt removal of China zero-covid policy the flow of people like Mr Liu across the mainland borders has resumed The number of passengers on Air China international routes rose by a third in December compared with the previous month Other parts of the economy will also improve as the year unfolds A recovery is expected in retail spending which fell last year and would have been even weaker had it not been for the anxious stockpiling of food and medicines The outlook should also improve for home sales which shrank by more than a quarter in 2022 the sharpest decline on record The government has given property developers a “blood transfusion” Mr Liu reported in Davos helping them raise finance It has also taken steps to quicken the pulse of the market which he hopes will help developers raise much-needed revenueBut the glaring exception to this brighter outlook is exports They are likely to fare worse in China year of reopening than in its last year of lockdowns Indeed the monthly figures have been negative in the past three releases According to ubs a bank merchandise exports will shrink by 4% in dollar terms in 2023 as a whole This would be only their fifth such fall since 1980 The re-globalisation of China people will coincide with a deglobalisation of its goods China will attract many more foreign visitors and fewer foreign salesIn one important respect China reopening has made life harder for its exporters The turnaround in China zero-covid policy has contributed to a revival of the yuan which has risen by 8% against the dollar since the start of November making Chinese exports less competitive Mr Liu invited his audience in Davos to visit China again But even before the global capitalists arrive global capital has rushed to reacquaint itself with Chinese assets bidding up the price of its currency Exporters have also converted more of their dollar earnings into yuan The main reason for the export bust though lies outside China The slowdown in the world economy will cut demand for its wares And the landing will not necessarily be soft In December for example China sales to America the eu and Japan fell by 17% compared with a year earlier Ting Lu of Nomura another bank worries that China will suffer from the so-called bullwhip effect A small dip in demand from consumers can lead to pronounced drops in orders for upstream suppliers just as a small flick of the wrist can lead to a vicious crack of the whip Even if the level of global spending proves resilient the mix is becoming less favourable to China In America and other rich countries consumption has shifted from the sorts of electronic goods that are prized by people working from home to the services people enjoy when they are able to move and mingle China global shipments of computers and their parts shrank by 35% in the latest trade figures When the threat of lockdowns dangled over global supply chains people worried that China exporters were a source of vulnerability for the world economy Instead the world economy is proving a source of vulnerability for China exporters For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 Jan 18th 2023,Venture capital $300bn question,Consider the following puzzle In 2021 venture capitalists raised $150bn in fresh cash a record amount Despite a market slowdown they broke the record once again in 2022 raising more than $160bn Chunks of this have already been spent but close to $300bn of “dry powder” sits waiting to be put to use Indeed spending fell throughout 2022 Fledgling firms appear cheap Why then are venture capitalists sitting on the cash?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs with many other puzzles in finance the answer starts with the rapid rise in global interest rates since the start of last year Higher rates have caused the value of stocks to plummet as investors have moved capital into safer assets such as cash and government bonds The tech-heavy nasdaq index has lost more than a fifth of its value over the past year In 2022 the amount of capital raised in stockmarket listings dropped to a 32-year low Public-market slowdowns such as the one currently in progress reduce expected returns for investors in private markets by lowering the valuation at which startups “exit” into public markets Venture capitalists therefore demand lower prices in order to invest in the first place This especially hurts funding for late-stage startups that in normal times might be close to a public listing Some firms flush with cash from fundraising in 2021 are choosing to wait things out reducing the pace of new deals The smaller number continuing with plans must hope to avoid a dreaded “down-round” in which a startup raises cash at a lower valuation than in a previous rounda let-down for employees and early investors who are forced to confront losses on their shares Meanwhile investors have become less willing to take a punt on riskier opportunities They can no longer count on another backer following them into a deal and helping make it a success either with expertise or raw cashThe second part of the answer is more subtle In theory venture capitalists could spend the money they have in hand It is after all already committed to their funds For some firms doing so would mean they would also avoid losing out on management fees which only apply to invested capital not that merely promised to their funds after a certain period of time But spending at a breakneck pace would almost certainly prove to be self-defeating in the long run Venture capitalists periodically raise money from limited partners such as endowments and pension funds Many of these now want to reduce their exposure to venture capital since public markets have taken a hit and they seek to keep allocations to different asset classes in rough proportion As a result a handful are calling up venture-capital funds to say things to the effect of “don’t rush back” for more money says an investor in several venture-capital funds Venture capitalists are listening Harry Nelis a partner at Accel a venture-capital firm speculates that cash which might have taken a year to spend during the market boom will now be made to last around three times as long And spending could get even slower The money raised by venture-capital funds does not actually sit in their bank accounts Instead funds must make “capital calls” to their limited partners when they want to finance an investment This forces the limited partner to free up cash from elsewhere in their portfolio which they are loth to do at a time of stress Funds are well aware that they will want to come back to their partners for more money in the future so seek to avoid irritating them by placing calls at awkward times Indeed in 2001 during a slowdown which followed the dotcom bubble some investors even “returned” committed funds to limited partners so that their partners could reallocate the money as they wishedVenture capitalists have other reasons to be concerned about relations with limited partners During the recent boom funds started to poke their noses far beyond their usual concerns Sequoia Capital a famous outfit in Silicon Valley launched a “superfund” which includes investments ranging from traditional venture-capital interests to public-market shares Some limited partners thought these sorts of funds were absurdly broad but opted to buy in anyway in order to gain access to specialist funds Little wonder that venture capitalists are now slamming on the brakes and seeking to repair relations with their limited partners At least as long as market conditions remain miserable the industry world-conquering ambition will remain on hold Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

 Jan 26th 2023,Have economists misunderstood inflation?,Imagine it is late 2024 Inflation in the rich world has fallen from its peak but stayed stubbornly high At around 4% it is well above the level at which most central banks are comfortable Governments weighed down by vast debts must use precious revenues to pay interest on the debt which itself is growing because of high interest rates The energy transition and rising state spending owing to ageing populations add to the fiscal largesse Raising taxes is politically fraught so more money is printed Inflation stays high and governments’ credibility worsens Central bankers are scratching their heads wondering how their powerful weaponthe interest ratehas failed so thoroughlyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA wonkish theory laid out in glorious detail in a new book by John Cochrane of Stanford University Hoover Institution would offer a potential explanation “The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level” builds a theory of inflation as ambitious as that proposed by John Maynard Keynes “The General Theory” or Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz “A Monetary History” Mr Cochrane whose own work on the subject spans four decades spends nearly 600 pages reworking the maths of past economic models to incorporate fiscal theory while chattily discussing how it explains past inflationary episodes “[E]ven Milton Friedman might change his mind with new facts and experience at hand” he speculatesAt the heart of Mr Cochrane theory is the idea that government debt can be valued like a firm equity based on the returns to its owner pockets The price level will adjustand therefore drive inflation or deflationto ensure that the real value of the debt equals the sum of a government future budget surpluses appropriately discounted Thus the true driver of inflation is government debt not monetary policy Under this theory money is valuable because it can be used to pay tax and generate surpluses The set-up is not all that different from the gold standard except it is tax rather than gold that backs money Mr Cochrane is careful to note that the adjustment of the price level is not instantaneous People can be poor judges of a government credibility when it comes to paying off debts Just like stocks prices are able to deviate from fundamentals Yet in the long run they adjust A government that hands out money without eventually running surpluses will not avoid inflation for ever History appears to offer support Brad DeLong of the University of California Berkeley uses fiscal theory in his recent book “Slouching towards Utopia” to explain inflation in post-first-world-war Europe In France hefty debt-interest payments led to an average of 20% annual inflation over seven years In Germany things were worse The public lost faith in the ability of the state to pay off its debts without inflation Soon hyperinflation kicked in Mr Cochrane also brings fiscal theory to bear on America inflation in the 1970s-80s In the mid-1970s price rises exceeded 12% The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates; inflation dropped to 5% by 1977 Yet Mr Cochrane points out that inflation shot up again to more than 14% by 1980 in part because America failed to get its fiscal house in order Fiscal and regulatory reforms that raised expectations of future surpluses along with another dose of monetary medicine were needed to vanquish inflationHow is fiscal theory faring today? For a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 prices stayed stubbornly low despite a ballooning supply of money and interest rates sitting at or below zero in much of the rich world A “crude monetarism” predicted an inflationary surge which did not materialise Other revamped “New Keynesian” models also proved unhelpful When governments spent big during the covid-19 pandemic many economists reasoning from recent history were sanguine about the possibility of inflationMr Cochrane argues fiscal theory can explain both the period of low inflation and the return of rapidly rising prices after the pandemic Inflation was meagre in the 2010s despite soaring government debts because politicians promised to get their books in order and low interest rates meant consumers and bondholders were willing to wait Yet during the pandemic governments took a different approach They dropped enormous cheques into consumers’ pockets The Fed purchased government debt immediately after its issuance There was little talk of sustainability Mr Cochrane argues that the direct nature of these “helicopter drops” informed people their newly fat pockets would not be drained by future taxes Thus they were more willing to spendHeads I win tails you loseThis story is perhaps too convenient Indeed Mr Cochrane admits that fiscal theory flaw is it offers a way of explaining nearly any series of historical events in an unfalsifiable manner Yes other theories of inflation have problems But if it is so hard to prove fiscal theory wrong are they really in a fair fight? Mr Cochrane story of how inflation ended in the 1980s is complicated by the fact that America actually cut taxes suggesting politicians were not all that concerned by balanced budgets Although deregulation may have boosted growth many economists think the budget surpluses of the 1990s were mainly caused by globalisation and an it boom which few consumers in the 1980s saw comingFiscal theory also offers limited guidance to policymakers beyond what is already well-known Under its approach monetary policy remains important: interest rates can spread out an increase in the price level over a period of time In addition the theory suggests governments must maintain credibility when it comes to paying off their debtshardly a radical idea Fast-forward once again to late 2024 Imagine this time inflation has fallen to 2% Interest rates are slowly coming down Central bankers are running a victory lap What of fiscal theory?

 Jan 26th 2023,What inflation means for the Big Mac index,For much of the past two years economists have argued fiercely about prices As inflation in America and elsewhere has exceeded central-bank targets analysts have dissected different components of the cost of living including the prices of goods services energy and rents Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut what about the Big Mac? The iconic McDonald burger is an amalgam of rent electricity and labour as well as beef bread and cheese Its price is therefore indicative of broader inflationary pressures And because the burger is basically the same wherever you are in the world its price can also reveal how inflation has changed the relative costliness of different countriesIn America for example the median price of a Big Mac has risen by more than 6% to an average of $536 in the past two years The price tends to be a bit higher in big cities According to the theory of purchasing-power parity when a country prices rise its currency should fall everything else equal This stops the country prices moving too far out of line with those elsewhere in the world Yet the dollar has risen not fallen over the past two years against the currencies of most other big economies A trade-weighted exchange-rate index published by America Federal Reserve increased by more than 9% from December 2020 to December 2022 One reason for this is that inflation has also returned to lots of America trading partners Indeed in many places it is worse Big Mac prices have risen by 14% over the past two years in the euro area and by 15% in Britain But the dollar rise against the euro and pound has been more than required to offset this inflation gapThe combination of rising prices and a rising currency threatens to move American prices out of whack with those elsewhere in the world Two years ago for example the Big Mac was 26% cheaper in Japan than America In principle this suggests the yen was undervalued and should have risen against the dollar In fact the opposite occurred A Big Mac is now more than 40% cheaper in Japan There are exceptions where the theory of purchasing-power parity has held Although Argentina peso has fallen against the dollar prices in the country have risen even faster A Big Mac now costs the equivalent of $531 That is high compared with the price two years ago and also compared with today price in Brazil $444 If the two Latin American countries were to form a currency union at today exchange rate Argentina would find itself at a hefty competitive disadvantage It would be almost 20% more expensive than its larger neighbour at least judging by burger pricesThe Economist has been making comparisons of this kind since 1986 Converting Big Mac prices into dollars always reveals big differences in the cost of the same burger in different countries One measure of the “fair value” of a currency is the exchange rate that would eliminate these gaps But of course exchange rates are not the only thing that can adjust Prices can also rise faster in one country than another In the long era of low inflation this was not where the action was Over the past two years prices have been on the move in many countries Unfortunately these bouts of inflation have done little to move burger prices closer together For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 26th 2023,When professional stockpickers beat the algorithms,Last year plunging markets left few investors smiling Stocks and bonds fell in tandem; haven assets failed to offer safe harbour Doing well meant making single-figure percentage losses rather than double It might therefore seem an odd time for fund managers to be walking with a spring in their step Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut on January 23rd it emerged that Citadel a secretive investment firm based in Miami had generated $16bn in net profits for its clients in 2022 breaking the record for the largest annual gain in dollar terms Its main hedge fund posted a 38% returnwhile msci broadest index of global stocks declined by 18% Champagne corks were popping elsewhere too Strategas Securities a brokerage and research firm reckons that 62% of active fund managers investing in large American firms beat the s&p 500 index of such shares in 2022 the highest percentage since 2005 Last year therefore snapped a miserable losing streak for stockpickers Every year from 2010 to 2021 more than half of active managers who benchmarked their performance against the s&p 500 failed to beat it In other words the average fund manager was outclassed by a simple algorithm blindly buying every stock in the index Such algorithmsknown as “passive” or “index” fundsare taking over By 2021 they held 43% of the assets managed by American investment companies and owned a greater share of the country stockmarket than their actively managed counterpartsThe logic that drives passive funds is inescapable By definition the performance of an index is the average of those who own the underlying stocks Beating an index is a zero-sum game If one investor does another must lose out Active managers may spot a superstar stock that ends up leaving the rest in the dust But it will also be in the index so passive investors will buy it too Meanwhile active managers tend to charge fees that are orders of magnitude higher than passive ones: often 1-2% a year and more for whizzy hedge funds compared with as little as 003% for their algorithmic peers This drag on performance makes it all but inevitable that index funds will outpace human money managers in the long runSo how did fund managers outperform in 2022?

 Jan 26th 2023,Argentina and Brazil propose a bizarre common currency,Argentina is running out of vaults With annual inflation nearing 100% as the central bank prints bills to cover the government fiscal deficit local banks are making space for ballooning stocks of pesos Officials have tightened capital controls Imports are at a standstill The government is going through the motions with the imf to avoid its tenth sovereign default since independence in 1816 Yet on January 22nd Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva Brazil president and Alberto Fernández his Argentine counterpart announced they would start preparations for a common currency possibly leading to a full currency union which would hitch South America biggest economy to one of its sickestListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea has a history First came the “gaucho” a currency meant to replace Brazil cruzado and Argentina austral until the concept was abandoned amid economic turmoil in 1988 On its heels was a proposal by members of Mercosur a trade alliance to adopt a common currency and sucre an experiment led by Venezuela which had ambitions to reduce the continent reliance on the dollar Since it is prone to selling foreign reserves to prop up the peso Argentina is always short of dollars to settle loans and pay for imports A joint currency would create alternative reserves and make neighbourly trade easier Brazil is Argentina largest trading partner By supporting the idea Lula as Mr Silva is known gets a reputational boost from being seen to revive regional co-operation That at least is the case for the idea The case against is daunting A full union with a joint central bank would surely crumble Economists judge how well countries fit in a currency union using criteria devised by Robert Mundell a Canadian economist that measure economic similarities Normally central bankers tailor interest rates to individual economies; in a union one rate has to do for them all Policy rates in Argentina and Brazil are an astonishing 61 percentage points apart Their business cycles are wildly out of sync as their main exportsagriculture and industrial commodities respectivelyare affected by different global headwinds Argentina problems make its downturns deeper and booms shorter and shallower Another condition specified by Mundell is that people and money should move smoothly across borders acting as a means of adjustment when a shock hits one country but not the other Whereas in Europe farm workers hop between jobs and countries South America poor infrastructure makes travel a hassle and Argentina capital controls make getting paid across borders nearly impossible If workers do not end up where they are most productive artificially high wages could spark inflation in parts of the union Moreover as long as Brazil was committed to the joint currency it would be forced to bail out its southern neighbour Secure in that knowledge Argentina would have every reason to carry on spending irresponsibly Brazil is already getting cold feet Officials have stressed the new currency would be an addition to the two national ones rather than a replacement and that it is a long-term project Other countries are not racing to join Lula and Mr Fernández offered South American leaders the chance to do so at a press conference on January 25th: no one has so far taken them up This watered-down union would still place Argentina problems at Brazil door There would need to be a monetary policymaker either a currency board or full-blown central bank to watch exchange rates The imf to which Argentina owes $72bn would be less willing to prop up the peso if Argentina had another legal tender To top it all off Lula would have to ignore his independent central bank which has come out in opposition to the idea On January 23rd barely 24 hours after the grand announcement Fernando Haddad Brazil finance minister implied the idea would only get off the ground as notes of credit that were backed by Argentinian commodities That would not be currency at all But it would be more borrowing which is exactly what Argentina set out to avoid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 24th 2023,How the world economy could avoid recession,Last year markets had a terrible time So far 2023 looks different Many indices including the Euro Stoxx 600 Hong Kong Hang Seng and a broad measure of emerging-market share prices have seen their best start to the year in decades America s&p 500 is up by 5% Since reaching its peak in October the trade-weighted value of the dollar has fallen by 7% a sign that fear about the global economy is ebbing Even bitcoin has had a good year Not long ago it felt as though a global recession was nailed on Now optimism is re-emerging Listen to

lower gas prices bye-bye recession” cheered analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank on January 18th in a report on the euro zone Nomura a Japanese lender has revised its forecast of Britain recession “to something less pernicious [than] what we originally expected” Citigroup another bank said that “the probability of a full-blown global recession in which growth in many countries turns down in tandem is now roughly 30% [in contrast with] the 50% assessment that we maintained through the second half of last year” These are crumbs: the world economy is weaker than at any point since the lockdowns of 2020 But investors will eat anything Forecasters are in part responding to real-time economic data Despite talk of a global recession since at least last February when Russia invaded Ukraine these have held up better than expected Consider a weekly estimate of gdp from the oecd a group of mostly rich countries which account for about 60% of global output It is hardly booming but in mid-January few countries were struggling see chart 1 Widely watched “purchasing-manager index” measures of global output rose slightly in January consistent with gdp growth of about 2%Official numbers remain mixed Recent figures on American retail and industry came in below expectations In Japan machinery orders were far weaker than forecast Yet after reaching an all-time low in the summer consumer confidence across the oecd has risen Shortly after we went to press officials were due to publish their first estimate of America gdp in the fourth quarter of 2022 Most economists were expecting a decent number though pandemic disruptions mean these figures will be less reliable than normal Labour markets seem to be holding up too In some rich countries including Austria and Denmark joblessness is risinga telltale sign that a recession is looming Barely a day goes by without an announcement from another big technology company that it is letting people go Yet tech accounts for a small share of overall jobs and in most countries unemployment remains low Happily in places where demand for labour is dropping employers are withdrawing job adverts rather than sacking people We estimate that since reaching an all-time high of more than 30m early last year unfilled vacancies across the oecd have fallen by about 10% Meanwhile the number of people actually in a job has fallen by less than 1% from its peak Investors pay attention to labour markets but they really care about right now is inflation It is too soon to know if this threat has passed In the rich world “core” inflation a measure of underlying pressure is still 5-6% year on year far higher than central banks find comfortable The problem though is no longer getting worse In America core inflation is coming down as is the share of small firms which plan to raise prices Another measure from researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a data firm and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations It also seems to be dropping see chart 2 Two factors explain why the global economy has held up better than expected: energy prices and private-sector finances Last year the cost of fuel in the rich world rose by well over 20%and by 60% or more in parts of Europe Economists expected prices to remain high in 2023 crushing energy-intensive sectors such as heavy industry They were wrong Helped by unseasonably warm weather companies have proved unexpectedly flexible when it comes to dealing with high costs In November German industrial gas consumption was 27% lower than normal yet industrial production was only 05% down on the year before And over the Christmas period European natural-gas prices fell by half to levels last seen before Russia invaded Ukraine see chart 3 The strength of private-sector finances has also made a difference Our best guess is that families in the g7 are sitting on “excess” savingsie those above and beyond what you would expect them to have accumulated in normal timesof around $3trn or about 10% of annual consumer spending accumulated through a combination of pandemic stimulus and lower outlays in 2020-21 As a result although companies’ quarterly earnings in America suggest spending is faltering it is not falling off a cliff Consumers can weather higher prices and a higher cost of credit Businesses meanwhile are still sitting on large cash piles And few face large debt repayments right now: $600bn of dollar-denominated corporate debt will mature this year compared with $900bn due in 2025Can the data continue to beat expectations? There is evidence including in a recent paper by Goldman Sachs a bank that the heaviest drag from tighter monetary policy occurs after about nine months Financial conditions started really tightening nine months ago If the theory holds then the economy soon might be on surer footing even as higher rates eat away at inflation China is another reason for cheer Although removing domestic covid-19 restrictions slowed the economy in December as people hid from the virus scrapping “zero-covid” will ultimately raise global demand for goods and services The pessimistic case however remains strong Central banks have a long way to go before they can be certain that inflation is under control especially with China reopening pushing up commodity prices America forward-looking indicators are getting bleaker In addition an economy on the cusp of recession is unpredictable Once people start to lose jobs and cut spending predicting the depths of a downturn becomes hard And a crucial lesson from recent years is that if something can go wrong it often does But it is nice to have a glimmer of hope all the same For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 23rd 2023,Can China fix its property crisis?,To judge by the high-rises dotted along the shore in Haiyang a small coastal city Country Garden prospects are pretty meagre The firm China biggest developer by sales has sold few beachside flats A handful of towers appear only partly built A faux-German village with pointed roofs accommodates shops and restaurants and adds a measure of flair But

have faced such difficulties The volume of floor space sold across the country fell by 24% in 2022 the biggest slump since data became available in 1992 Meanwhile property investment was down 10% year on year the first drop on record Cross-border defaults are also proving difficult Evergrande the world most indebted developer which collapsed in 2021 has still not produced a restructuring plan originally due in July The firm auditor PwC resigned on January 16th This reduction in activity has been catastrophic for China economy which derives around a fifth of its gdp from property The country officials are currently redesigning policy on a vast scale The government has abandoned its “zero-covid” approach to the pandemic while simultaneously signalling an end to a crackdown on technology firms Policymakers are also trying to rescue the property industry After two years of forcing developers to deleveragewhich has pushed dozens to default on debtsregulators are now abandoning many of these measures in the hope of reviving sentiment This has prompted a measure of optimism Despite the bleak view in Haiyang Country Garden share price has trebled since OctoberThe exact contents of the government reforms remain murky On January 13th officials produced a draft 21-point plan which stated that the aim was to provide liquidity to “good-quality” developers The task now is to differentiate between these companies and bad ones: no clear definition has been given of what constitutes good quality The plan will also push policy banks to grant loans for stalled projects and state-owned asset managers to provide credit for mergers and acquisitions Commercial banks which had pulled back from property have been told to start lending to reliable developers once again And state media report that the “three-red-lines” policy which capped debt will be relaxed for 30 unnamed firms Companies began rapidly raising new debt in Decembera sign that policy easing kicked off well before the government announced the new measures Local authorities have been lowering mortgage rates and many are now at record lows The state bail-out funds are targeting unfinished construction About 60% of homes sold between 2013 and 2020 are thought not to have been delivered to buyers many of whom have nevertheless started to make payments Without funding construction projects have stalled and cannot be finished Fear of unfinished homes has put off prospective buyersThe state also wants to avoid more messy defaults Country Garden made a last-minute payment to bondholders on January 17th This was enabled by support from local governments something few companies aside from those as big and important as Country Garden have at the moment According to Refinitiv a data firm some 950bn yuan $140bn in offshore dollar debts alone will mature this year up from 810bn yuan last year The plan is showing some early results Home completions fell by 6% year on year in December marking a recovery from the month before when they fell by 18% see chart This is a closely watched measure: unfinished homes prompted homebuyers to boycott their mortgage payments last year

first ten days of the year compared with the same period a month earlierKaisa a developer that defaulted in 2021 has been avoiding restructuring talks with foreign investors and looks to be far from an agreement with creditors Yet despite its troubles demand for the company homes appears to be growing Analysts from CreditSights a research firm recently visited a project in Shanghai and found agents were no longer offering discounts on flats The absence of price cuts suggests demand is beginning to pick up for properties in good locationsA few foreign investors have been encouraged by the state plan Firms have almost entirely been shut out from the offshore bond market where many global asset managers and hedge funds are trying to recoup losses following missed payments The funds raised by developers fell by a quarter last year compared with the year before But on January 12th Dalian Wanda Commercial Management priced a $400m junk bond the first in more than a year and a sign

 Jan 19th 2023,Could Europe end up with a worse inflation problem than America?,Inflation is coming down On both sides of the Atlantic falling energy costs are provoking sighs of relief Price-watchers are now focused on core inflation a measure that strips out volatile food and energy prices and is usually much slower to riseand more difficult to bring down Since October core inflation in the euro zone has been higher than in America Could Europeans end up with a worse inflation problem than their transatlantic peers? Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvery economist knows Milton Friedman dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” But the Nobel-prizewinner words do not seem to capture the current bout of inflation where post-pandemic supply disruptions fiscal splurges an energy shock and labour shortages have created a near-perfect storm causing prices to soar How fast inflation comes down may therefore depend not only on what central banks do but on how these factorsthe disruptions energy shock and wage risesaffect economies on either side of the AtlanticAlongside these surprises there has been extraordinary tumult in the basic operations of rich-world economies Covid-19 altered how people work what they consume and where they live and did so in short order Removing pandemic restrictions then led to a surge in demand for travel nights out and treats On top of this governments in America and Europe have decided to subsidise green technologies on an unprecedented scale Capital production inputs and workers need to move to parts of the economy that are growing and away from those that are shrinking Until they do the economy cannot produce enough to meet demandYet moving jobs or investing in new plants or software takes time A boom accelerates the process Recent work by Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and colleagues shows that workers in Germany are more likely to change jobs when demand is high than during recessions Another study using American data suggests that moving to a growing firm increases pay for the job-switching worker substantially The current shifts in the economy are therefore likely to produce some inflationand that may be desirable A recent paper by Veronica Guerrieri of the University of Chicago and colleagues argues that monetary policy should tolerate somewhat higher inflation if doing so allows workers to find a new job during periods of economic changeGovernment policies in America and Europe have affected the pace of adjustment to these changes Europe approach was generally to try to freeze things in place during the pandemic The continent governments created generous furlough schemes which kept workers in their existing jobs Unlike America there was no boom in durable-goods consumption financed by stimulus cheques that required expanded production Nor did Europe run its economy hot to aid a reallocation of workers and capital If inflation in America is the result of an economic reshuffle it may come down faster than Europe once that process is complete Europe also had to cope with a different economic hit Julian di Giovanni of the Federal Reserve and colleagues show that compared with America supply crunches accounted for a greater share of inflation in 2020-21 Wholesale gas and electricity prices began to rise in autumn 2021 and soared after Russia invaded Ukraine with oil and coal prices following This added much more to inflation in energy-importing Europe than it did in America The consensus in economics is that central banks should not tighten policy too much in response to a temporary supply or energy shock Coping with such a shock is hard enoughno need to give the screw another turn The effects should subside over time so long as inflation expectations stay stable Now that supply crunches in everything from lumber to chips are easing and energy prices are coming down Europe should benefit more than America That is if inflation has not become entrenched Inflation gets baked into economies when workers and firms come to believe that prices will keep rising In the worst-case scenario this creates a wage-price spiral with workers and firms unable to agree on a division of the economic pie In a tight flexible labour market like America which has little collective bargaining wage growth should quickly track inflation And that is what happened: wage growth accelerated when inflation began to rise As a new paper by Guido Lorenzoni of Northwestern University and Ivan Werning of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argues this theoretically increases the risk of a wage-price spiral But America seems to have made it past the point of greatest danger According to Indeed a hiring website the country wage growth though high has been coming down for a while Blessed unionsIn Europe wages are often decided in collective-bargaining agreements Across the eu around six in ten workers are covered by such arrangements Deals typically last a year or more meaning that wages take time to adjust to economic conditions That was great when inflation got going Wage pressures did not immediately add to inflation Unions and firms could negotiate about how to divide the blow to incomes and profits After all the two sides meet at the same table every year to take stock and adjust Since they cover large chunks of the economy they have reason to take the macroeconomic effects of any deal into accountBut relations are feeling the strain With inflation in Europe stubbornly high unions are demanding extra compensation for their members Germany public-sector outfits are seeking a 105% increase in the latest round of bargaining Such delayed increases in pay are a normal feature of an economy where wages take time to adjust and which has been hit by a supply shock As Messrs Lorenzoni and Werning demonstrate real wages typically take a hit before recovering to their old level But whereas America appears to be making progress the old continent remains some way behind Europe inflation race has

 Jan 19th 2023,China re-globalisation paradox,At the annual World Economic Forum meeting this week in Davos Switzerland China economic tsar Liu He met a number of “old friends” he had not seen during his country long battle with covid-19 In a solicitous speech he acknowledged the importance of in-person meetings lamented the fragmentation of the world and called for economic “re-globalisation” In a philosophical aside he also emphasised the “duality” of things Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina recently abandoned “zero-covid” policy cut the country off from the rest of the world contributing to the fragmentation Mr Liu bemoaned But China period of isolation had a notable duality of its own Although the movement of people across China borders was sharply curtailed the movement of goods from China to the rest of the world was spectacular Despite all the disruptions China exports grew by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 and by another 7% in 2022 according to figures released on January 13th Perhaps in-person meetings are overratedChina episodic lockdowns proved less damaging to trade than feared at the time When Shanghai was brought to a standstill in April and May many worried it would clog international supply chains and push up global inflation But a lot of trade passed through nearby Ningbo instead An index of global supply-chain pressure created by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York peaked at the end of 2021 before China fraught battles with Omicron last year The index decline since then was interrupted by the Shanghai lockdown and Russia invasion of Ukraine but not for long see chart Prices tell a similar story In June when the headline inflation rate in the United States peaked at 91% the average price of Chinese imports into America rose by only 33% compared with a year earlier With the abrupt removal of China zero-covid policy the flow of people like Mr Liu across the mainland borders has resumed The number of passengers on Air China international routes rose by a third in December compared with the previous month Other parts of the economy will also improve as the year unfolds A recovery is expected in retail spending which fell last year and would have been even weaker had it not been for the anxious stockpiling of food and medicines The outlook should also improve for home sales which shrank by more than a quarter in 2022 the sharpest decline on record The government has given property developers a “blood transfusion” Mr Liu reported in Davos helping them raise finance It has also taken steps to quicken the pulse of the market which he hopes will help developers raise much-needed revenueBut the glaring exception to this brighter outlook is exports They are likely to fare worse in China year of reopening than in its last year of lockdowns Indeed the monthly figures have been negative in the past three releases According to ubs a bank merchandise exports will shrink by 4% in dollar terms in 2023 as a whole This would be only their fifth such fall since 1980 The re-globalisation of China people will coincide with a deglobalisation of its goods China will attract many more foreign visitors and fewer foreign salesIn one important respect China reopening has made life harder for its exporters The turnaround in China zero-covid policy has contributed to a revival of the yuan which has risen by 8% against the dollar since the start of November making Chinese exports less competitive Mr Liu invited his audience in Davos to visit China again But even before the global capitalists arrive global capital has rushed to reacquaint itself with Chinese assets bidding up the price of its currency Exporters have also converted more of their dollar earnings into yuan The main reason for the export bust though lies outside China The slowdown in the world economy will cut demand for its wares And the landing will not necessarily be soft In December for example China sales to America the eu and Japan fell by 17% compared with a year earlier Ting Lu of Nomura another bank worries that China will suffer from the so-called bullwhip effect A small dip in demand from consumers can lead to pronounced drops in orders for upstream suppliers just as a small flick of the wrist can lead to a vicious crack of the whip Even if the level of global spending proves resilient the mix is becoming less favourable to China In America and other rich countries consumption has shifted from the sorts of electronic goods that are prized by people working from home to the services people enjoy when they are able to move and mingle China global shipments of computers and their parts shrank by 35% in the latest trade figures When the threat of lockdowns dangled over global supply chains people worried that China exporters

 Jan 18th 2023,Venture capital $300bn question,Consider the following puzzle In 2021 venture capitalists raised $150bn in fresh cash a record amount Despite a market slowdown they broke the record once again in 2022 raising more than $160bn Chunks of this have already been spent but close to $300bn of “dry powder” sits waiting to be put to use Indeed spending fell throughout 2022 Fledgling firms appear cheap Why then are venture capitalists sitting on the cash?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs with many other puzzles in finance the answer starts with the rapid rise in global interest rates since the start of last year Higher rates have caused the value of stocks to plummet as investors have moved capital into safer assets such as cash and government bonds The tech-heavy nasdaq index has lost more than a fifth of its value over the past year In 2022 the amount of capital raised in stockmarket listings dropped to a 32-year low Public-market slowdowns such as the one currently in progress reduce expected returns for investors in private markets by lowering the valuation at which startups “exit” into public markets Venture capitalists therefore demand lower prices in order to invest in the first place This especially hurts funding for late-stage startups that in normal times might be close to a public listing Some firms flush with cash from fundraising in 2021 are choosing to wait things out reducing the pace of new deals The smaller number continuing with plans must hope to avoid a dreaded “down-round” in which a startup raises cash at a lower valuation than in a previous rounda let-down for employees and early investors who are forced to confront losses on their shares Meanwhile investors have become less willing to take a punt on riskier opportunities They can no longer count on another backer following them into a deal and helping make it a success either with expertise or raw cashThe second part of the answer is more subtle In theory venture capitalists could spend the money they have in hand It is after all already committed to their funds For some firms doing so would mean they would also avoid losing out on management fees which only apply to invested capital not that merely promised to their funds after a certain period of time But spending at a breakneck pace would almost certainly prove to be self-defeating in the long run Venture capitalists periodically raise money from limited partners such as endowments and pension funds Many of these now want to reduce their exposure to venture capital since public markets have taken a hit and they seek to keep allocations to different asset classes in rough proportion As a result a handful are calling up venture-capital funds to say things to the effect of “don’t rush back” for more money says an investor in several venture-capital funds Venture capitalists are listening Harry Nelis a partner at Accel a venture-capital firm speculates that cash which might have taken a year to spend during the market boom will now be made to last around three times as long And spending could get even slower The money raised by venture-capital funds does not actually sit in their bank accounts Instead funds must make “capital calls” to their limited partners when they want to finance an investment This forces the limited partner to free up cash from elsewhere in their portfolio which they are loth to do at a time of stress Funds are well aware that they will want to come back to their partners for more money in the future so seek to avoid irritating them by placing calls at awkward times Indeed in 2001 during a slowdown which followed the dotcom bubble some investors even “returned” committed funds to limited partners so that their partners could reallocate the money as they wishedVenture capitalists have other reasons to be concerned about relations with limited partners During the recent boom funds started to poke their noses far beyond their usual concerns Sequoia Capital a famous outfit in Silicon Valley launched a “superfund” which includes investments ranging from traditional venture-capital interests to public-market shares Some limited partners thought these sorts of funds were absurdly broad but opted to buy in anyway in order to gain access to specialist funds Little wonder that venture capitalists are now slamming on the brakes and seeking to repair relations with their limited partners At least as long as market conditions remain miserable the industry world-conquering ambition will remain on hold Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The dollar could bring investors a nasty surprise Jan 12thWill investors have another awful year in 2023?

 Jan 18th 2023,Japan extraordinarily expensive defence of its monetary policy,In december the Bank of Japan boj gave speculators an opening By lifting its cap on ten-year government bond yields from 025% to 05% the central bank raised the prospect that it would abandon its “yield-curve-control” policy entirely Since then officials have been put to the test by increasingly unco-operative bond markets The boj has been forced to make enormous bond purchases in an attempt to drive down the yield buying ¥95trn $72bn on January 12th and 13th aloneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSpeculators excitedly awaited the boj next meeting Would it be the moment the central bank gave up the fight? On January 18th the boj announced it would in fact keep going The bank even promised to buy more bonds if necessary The yen slumped on the news; short-sellers licked their wounds Yet defending the policy is becoming astonishingly costly The boj difficult decisions are not going awayYield-curve control was introduced by the bank in 2016 as part of an aggressive programme of monetary easing which officials hoped would lift Japan dormant inflation and economic growth The boj is one of the few central banks to have stuck to its guns in 2022neither raising interest rates nor halting big asset purchasesas inflation has risen around the world Japanese inflation has increased too but only to 38% year-on-year in December This is less than half the peaks in America and the euro zone And much of the surge is the result of high energy prices and the weak yen which hit a 32-year low against the dollar in October Thus the boj argues underlying inflation is yet to rise to its target level of 2% in a sustainable mannerThe central bank decision to lift the cap on bond yields in December was an attempt to improve liquidity and facilitate more trading It seems to have backfired The boj owns around half of the country bond market and more than 95% of some bond issuances after a decade of hefty purchases Extra purchases to defend the cap have worsened market shortagesThe boj decision to hold fast could exacerbate the situation The central bank is building vast potential losses on its bond portfolio If Japanese bond yields were to rise by just 025 percentage points the bank total holdings as of January 10th would slump in value by around ¥75trn or 14% of gdp according to our calculations Every extra bond bought to maintain the yield cap increases the potential loss Higher yields also alter Japan fiscal arithmetic Government net debt ran to about 173% of gdp in the third quarter of last year the highest of any rich country Some 8% of the national budget is spent on interest payments If payments on the stock of government debt rose by the same amount025 percentage pointsthe total bill would run to ¥11trn or 10% of this year government budget In the year ahead the boj has no good options For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 17th 2023,Investment banks are struggling in a high-interest-rate world,Shareholders like profits: a steady stream of income they can count on quarter after quarter The earnings America biggest banks make however are often pushed around by the volatility of the economy they serve If the economy accelerates demand for loans takes off; if it slows bankers must set aside provisions for bad loans Investment banks’ trading businesses tend to do well in times of volatility and uncertainty but their advisory services sell best when markets are healthy and stable Bank bosses must try to balance their exposure to these forcesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe past three years during which the American economy has experienced a pandemic-induced shutdown a financial boom and a rate shock have been unusually volatile As a result the period has been an interesting test of just how successful bank bosses have been in their efforts to balance the performance of their businesses The results were on show between January 13th and 17th as Bank of America Citigroup Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo took it in turns to report fourth quarter and full-year earningsAltogether profits at the six banks fell by 20% from $34bn in the fourth quarter of 2021 to around $27bn in the same period of 2022but the pain was not evenly spread Earnings at JPMorgan and Bank of America were up a little Meanwhile at Goldman Sachs they were down by two-thirds Some of this gap can be explained by their different strengths Firms with big consumer banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan typically do well when interest rates jump Rising rates tend to increase the difference between what banks pay out on deposits and earn on loans Net interest income as this gap is called zoomed higher in 2022 It climbed by $17bn between the end of 2021 and 2022 across the big six banks reaching $66bn This increase is partly offset by the fact that higher interest rates will make it harder for consumers and companies to pay back debts Banks also set aside some $72bn for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2022 Jamie Dimon boss of JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan boss of Bank of America have both predicted a mild recession in America this year Yet for the moment the net effect of higher interest rates on profits remains positive Investment-bank revenues which fall when stockmarkets do badly dropped by around 50% at Goldman and Morgan Stanley But the divergence in profits between the six banks cannot simply be explained by the differing performance of investment and consumer banks For one thing profits at Morgan Stanley where non-investment-bank businesses did well dropped far less sharply than at Goldman For another Wells Fargo offered up another bleak quarter despite its big consumer bank with profits half their level a year ago The pain at Wells can be explained by regulatory troubles In December the bank agreed to pay an enormous fine of $17bn to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for improperly managing millions of consumer accounts It is harder to explain the situation at Goldman The firm sought to build a consumer bank in part to diversify its business But it has had to set aside unusually high provisions for loan losses in that department and is now scaling back its efforts “What went wrong?” asked one analyst on the Goldman earnings call on January 17th David Solomon the bank boss argued the firm had tried to do too much too fast and had lacked the talent to pull off some of its wide-ranging ambitions Six days earlier the company had sacked 65% of its workforce The enormous economic shocks in recent years have revealed just how different the six banks have become In some cases the shocks have also revealed just how poorly they have been managed For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 15th 2023,Why health-care services are in chaos everywhere,The imposition of lockdowns during the covid-19 pandemic had one overarching aim: to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed Governments hoped to space out infections buying time to build capacity In the end however much of this extra capacity went unused England seven “Nightingale” hospitals closed having received only a few patients as did many of America field hospitals A study of Europe experience in Health Policy a journal found only one example where there were more covid patients than intensive-care beds: in the Italian region of Lombardy on April 3rd 2020 Although there are now stories of overwhelmed Chinese hospitals as the country confronts a great exit wave it is too soon to know whether these are isolated examples or represent broader systematic failureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOutside China covid weighs less heavily on people minds these days Yet health-care systems in much of the rich world are closer to collapse than at any point since the disease started to spread Unlike for unemployment or gdp there are few comparable up-to-date figures on health-care performance across countries So The Economist has trawled statistics produced by countries regions and even individual hospitals to paint a picture of what is going on The results suggest patients doctors and nurses are experiencing the brutal after-effects of the pandemicStart with Britain which produces high-quality data The National Health Service nhs the country state-run provider is in dire straits Just before the pandemic struck someone with a medical issue requiring urgent but not immediate attention a category that includes those suffering strokes and heart attacks waited on average 20 minutes for an ambulance Now they wait longer than an hour and a half see chart The number of lengthy “trolley waits”the time between a decision to admit a patient and arriving at a hospital wardhas jumped Other countries have less comprehensive statistics but equally miserable populations In September Ipsos a pollster released a global survey that included a question on the quality of local health care In almost all of the 20-odd rich countries surveyed people were less likely than in 2021 to say that the service on offer to them was “good” or “very good” In Britain the share saying so fell by five percentage points In Canada it fell by ten in Italy by 12Italian hospitals inundated by covid patients in early 2020 are struggling once again We analysed data from the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo site of some of the harrowing images of people on ventilators nearly three years ago In the year covid hit Italy the hospital waiting lists rose slightly on some measures They then fell slightly the next year But in 2022 they jumped Someone in the city looking for a non-urgent breast ultrasound may have to wait as long as two years Officials in Emilia-Romagna another region hit hard in 2020 have launched a plan to return waiting lists to pre-pandemic levelsNewspapers across the Anglosphere are filled with horror stories In New South Wales Australia a quarter of patients had to wait more than half an hour to be transferred from paramedics to emergency-room staff in the third quarter of 2022 up from a tenth two years before In Canada waiting times have reached an all-time high with a median delay of half a year between referral and treatment Even the richest most competent systems are feeling the strain In Switzerland there are fewer free intensive-care beds than at most points in the pandemic Germany is seeing similar problems with a surge in patients reducing intensive-care capacity see chart In Singapore patients waited for about nine hours to be seen in the average polyclinic at the end of 2021 By October 2022 they were waiting for 13America is doing better than most countries thanks to the vast amount of money it spends on health care and the excess capacity this funds But it is not doing well Average hospital-occupancy rates recently exceeded 80% for the first time Even in the darkest days of the pandemic few states reported paediatric wards under stress which we define as 90% or more beds being occupied In early November fully 17 states were in this position the result of a rise in all sorts of bugs in kids Every kind of sickness and disasterThe collapse in the quality of health care is contributing to an astonishing rise in “excess deaths”those above what would be expected in a normal year In many rich-world countries 2022 proved deadlier even than 2021 a year of several big waves of covid Monthly deaths across Europe are currently about 10% higher than expected Germany is in the middle of a vast mortality wave: weekly deaths have been more than 10% above normal since September In early December they were 23% higher What is going on? Politicians at both a national and regional level are taking the blameand occasionally deserve it But the forces creating the chaos are common across countries and are linked to a shared experience of the pandemic They may also in the short term at least be almost impossible for governments to overcome In the oecd club of mostly rich countries health expenditure is now not far short of 10% of gdp having been below 9% before the pandemic see chart Of the 20 countries for which there are data for 2021 18 spent more per person than ever before Almost all spent more as a share of gdp than in 2019 Even adjusting the figures for ageing populations does not meaningfully change these findings Thus the immediate problems facing health-care systems are not caused by a lack of cash Much of the increased spending has gone on programmes to combat covid including testing and tracing and vaccines But funding is now rising across systems more broadly In almost every rich country more people are working in health care than ever before Total employment in hospitals in 2021 was 9% higher than in the year before the pandemic in the six oecd countries we surveyed The latest data suggest that in Canada 16m people now work in health care the most ever In the eu more than 12m people work in “human-health activities” a record American hospitals employ 53m people another record Perhaps the real problem is not staff numbers but how efficiently they are working Real output in America hospital and ambulatory-health-care sector which in effect measures the quantity of care provided is only 39% above its pre-pandemic level whereas output across the economy as a whole is 64% higher In England elective-care activity ie surgery planned in advance is slightly lower than it was before the pandemic struck In Western Australia the share of delayed elective surgeries jumped from 11% to 24% in the two years to November Put simply hospitals are doing less with more Although falling productivity growth is an economywide phenomenon health care currently suffers from additional pressures A recent paper by Diane Coyle of Cambridge University and colleagues looking at Britain considers the effects of dealing with covid “Donning and doffing” protocols to replace protective kit and cleaning requirements after dealing with covid patients both of which are still in force in many countries today slow everything down The segregation of covid from non-covid patients limits bed allocation Meanwhile staff feel wretched after three gruelling years A report in Mayo Clinic Proceedings a journal finds that quantitative measures of “burnout” among American physicians have shot up see chart If health-care workers are exhausted they may do fewer of the things that kept the show on the road such as staying late to make sure the patients’ register is in order or helping with the treatment of another medic patient Many among you are weakProductivity has fallenbut it has not plummeted in the manner that would be needed to explain the chaos This suggests the true explanation for the breakdown lies elsewhere: in exploding demand Coming out of lockdowns people seem to require more help than ever before Some of this is to do with immunity People went two years without being exposed to bugs Since then endemic pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus have bloomed Everyone you know has the flu But the pandemic also bottled up other conditions which are only now being diagnosed In 2020-21 many people delayed seeking treatment for fear of catching covid or because their local hospital was shut to non-covid conditions In Italy cancer diagnoses fell by about 40% in 2020 compared with 2018-19 A study of American patients noted a particular reduction in diagnoses was recorded over a similar period in cancers normally found during a screening or routine examination In England the nhs waiting list has grown by more than 60% since the pandemic was declared Many of the people on the list and on similar ones in other countries are likely to be sicker and thus to take up more resources than if they had received care in 2020 A recent paper published in Lancet Public Health another journal estimates that over the next two decades deaths from colorectal cancer could be nearly 10% higher in Australia than pre-pandemic trends suggested in part because of delays in treatmentCovid continues to add to demand as well The Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank estimates that the disease is cutting the number of available beds in the nhs by 2-7% As covid-positive patients draw resources providers offer everyone worse care Research by Thiemo Fetzer of Warwick University and Christopher Rauh of Cambridge University suggests that for every 30 or so extra covid deaths one non-covid patient dies “caused by the disruption to the quality of care” The effects of malfunctioning health-care systems go beyond unnecessary deaths People come to feel that their country is falling apart If you live in a rich country and fall ill you expect someone to help And someone is definitely supposed to help when the tax burden is at or close to an all-time high as it is in many places In time the backlog created by the pandemic will disappear The surge in respiratory viruses in adults and children has probably peaked Administrators have made progress in tackling enormous waiting lists But with an ageing population and covid now an ever-present threat pre-pandemic health care may come to seem like it was from a lost golden age For more

 Jan 12th 2023,Has economics run out of big new ideas?,At the annual meeting of the American Economic Association held this year in New Orleans wonks discussed everything from inflation and technological progress to the economics of crime and the energy transition Yet those looking for big breakthroughs would have left unsatisfied Most new work focused on rigorous analysis of data or painstaking theoretical modelling As one attendee noted such modelling often fails to produce surprising results since it tends to reflect the assumptions that go into itListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvidence for this downsizing of ambition is not purely anecdotal A recent paper in Nature analyses citation data from 1945 to 2010 to assess the disruptiveness of papers and patents The authors consider new work to be disruptive if later work that cites it is less likely to also mention its predecessors The paper concludes that the share of disruptive research in the social sciences has fallen precipitously even more so than in the actual sciences As Tyler Cowen of George Mason University puts it: “In the last 30 years the reliability of empirical work and estimations has risen dramatically Which is good But few new important ideas have really been generated”In New Orleans economics biggest names offered ideas that were fresh and interesting but hardly breakthroughs on the scale of say the Nash equilibrium or the idea of asymmetric information Gita Gopinath the imf chief economist discussed research on how the economics of international finance has shifted since the seminal work of Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming in the 1960s In a seminar on economic growth Thomas Philippon of New York University argued that growth follows linear trends rather than being an exponential process Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology presented work on “distorted innovation” arguing against the idea that markets tend to get innovation rightNew theories without robust empirical support can be dangerous as demonstrated by the rise of central planning during the 20th century And big advances are easier to spot in hindsight It may even turn out that there were some hidden among the presentations in New Orleans Some conference attendees were also more optimistic about the present state of affairs A professor noted that good questions in economics tend to come from real-world eventsand the past few years have been tumultuous enough to raise plenty of good questions Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University observes that the use of large datasets machine learning and field experiments are all “game-changers” Innovation may therefore simply be shifting from theory to practice Indeed the use of high-frequency data a feature of a presentation by Lisa Cook of the Federal Reserve has given economists and central bankers a helpful new way to look at the world in their fight against inflation Yet the most compelling evidence on the impact of monetary policy on inflation came from Christina Romer of the University of California Berkeley who dusted off an old-fashioned method In her talk she argued that monetary-policy changes have bigger effects on unemployment than inflation and that it sometimes takes a few years for their main impact to be felt The method used by Ms Romer and her husband and co-author David Romer was not a new statistical technique or even timelier data but a “narrative approach” The Romers combed through transcripts and minutes from meetings held by the Federal Open Market Committeejust as they had when they developed the method in a paper published in 1989 For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 11th 2023,Warnings from history for a new era of industrial policy,“Free trade is almost dead” declared Morris Chang the founder of tsmc dampening the mood at an event in December to celebrate a milestone in the building of the Taiwanese chipmaker new fab in Arizona The remark was not out of character In July he called America effort to bring chipmaking home an “exercise in futility” Until recently rich-world governments mostly shared his judgment But worries about supply-chain security in a fraught world are prompting experimentation History provides some reasons for optimismas well as many for concern Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIndustrial policy is just about as old as industry itself Scarcely had Britain Industrial Revolution got going when Alexander Hamilton America first Treasury secretary argued for protection of his country industry declaring that Adam Smith arguments in favour of free trade “though ‘geometrically true’ are ‘practically false’” America France and Germany industrialised behind tariff barriers After the second world war scores of governments tried to help industrialisation along with seeming success in places like Japan and South Korea and rather different results elsewhere Policy today is of a different sort: pursued by countries already at the technological frontier in a world of complex global supply chains Yet past research still holds valuable lessonsRecent interventions are mostly based on “infant-industry” arguments The idea is that if the state corrects a market failure a particular industry might thrive on its own in an economy where it is nascent or absent Local firms might need investment in know-how or equipment to be competitive which imperfect capital markets cannot finance Alternatively production might require a network of suppliers and manufacturers but firms struggle to co-ordinate Or there may be information problems An economy might have undiscovered potential but an entrepreneur who seeks it out risks revealing it to competitors which costs him the opportunity to profit from his discovery In each case government support or a brief spell of protection from foreign competition or both might create the space the industry needs to mature Working out if these theories are practically or merely geometrically true is no simple task Industrial policy is never conducted in isolation meaning it is often challenging to isolate its effects Still careful work suggests that infant-industry policy can work in the real world In the 1970s for instance America was the dominant exporter of computer chips The Japanese government invested heavily in semiconductor research and may have helped chip-consuming Japanese firms co-ordinate to obtain most of their supply from fledgling Japanese producers in effect shutting American firms out of the market Work by Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva and Paul Krugman of the City University of New York concluded that these policies supported the accumulation of expertise without which Japanese firms could never have succeeded in export markets More recent work by Myrto Kalouptsidi of Harvard University revealed that Chinese shipyard subsidies between 2006 and 2012 reduced costs by as much as 20% These subsidies she reckons helped account for a major reallocation of shipbuilding with Japan the big loser Other research turns up more cases when interventions have helped industries secure a market foothold and meaningfully influenced the global distribution of production At least sometimes comparative advantage can be engineeredYet an abundance of caution is in order Interventions often raise costs and thus hurt consumers Messrs Baldwin and Krugman judged the Japanese were made worse off on net by the effort to build a chip-exporting industry Because the output of one industry is often the input for another help for upstream producers can inflict pain further along the supply chain Reviewing efforts to boost steel industries across 21 countries Bruce Blonigen of the University of Oregon found such interventions sharply cut the export competitiveness of downstream industriesGovernments for their part must be willing to cut off help so that winners eventually swim while losers sink Otherwise zombie firms will tie up capital and labour and drag down growth Local conditions matter A study of eu investment funds provided to poorer regions by Sascha Becker of the University of Warwick and Peter Egger and Maximilian von Ehrlich of eth Zurich found that the cash translated into faster growth in investment and incomebut only in places with strong institutions and educated workers And as the world is rediscovering careless policy can provoke retaliation leaving everyone worse off This may prove to be a particular problem at a time when sophisticated goods are produced along cross-border supply chains If friendly countries fail to co-ordinate they may end up funding duplicative plants which cannot all be economical or orphan industries without access to the foreign components they need to competeHard problemsPolicies which fill institutional gaps are safer Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College notes that America tariffs in the 19th century do not seem to have been decisive in promoting its rise to industrial dominance Banking laws that facilitated saving and investment were more important In their survey Ann Harrison and Andrés Rodríguez-Clare of the University of California Berkeley doubt that “hard” interventions which distort market prices are of use but find an important role for “soft” collaborations between firms and the state to solve co-ordination failures This does not mean that the “harder” parts of America policy mix will doom its reshoring enterprise Mr Chang for his part insisted in December that he gave his remarks “in the full expectation that we are going to have success” Indeed the most pressing concern may be less that America gambit will fail than that it will succeed in boosting domestic industryand leave a fractured world worse off for it Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The Federal Reserve great anti-hero deserves a second look

 Jan 10th 2023,The hunt for FTX missing riches,On January 5th Sam Bankman-Fried turned up at the funeral of his own crypto empire He lodged a complaint against ftx bankruptcy proceedings demanding $500m in frozen assets earmarked for creditors Mr Bankman-Fried wants the money in order to pay legal fees for his criminal trial in which he is accused of sucking billions of dollars of customer deposits from the crypto exchange for his own use he has pleaded not guilty Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe demand is an opening salvo in what will be a long chaotic battle America bankruptcy laws have evolved over centuries to pick apart regular businesses Now on the fly lawyers must work out how to apply them to crypto companies In November ftx filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 which allows a bankrupt firm to reorganise rather than liquidate The process usually plays out as a legally refereed tussle between a company and its creditors The firm told by a court what it owes tries to convince lenders to accept stakes in the business rather than cash If successful it emerges with less borrowing and a shiny new growth plan If unsuccessful it shuts up shop A big restructuring might have 100 creditors A long one lasts a year A complex one takes at least a couple In a hearing on January 11th it emerged that ftx may have as many as 9m creditorsmaking it by this measure the ugliest corporate carcass ever seen The firm breakdown has left 134 insolvent entities in 27 jurisdictions They range from ftx Zuma a Nigerian exchange to Good Luck Games a game developer The proceedings could take a decade and turn up more allegations of wrongdoing As he sorts through the mess John Ray III Mr Bankman-Fried successor as boss of ftx has become a de facto federal investigator In a recent visit to Congress he promised to recommend more suspects for criminal charges if he stumbled across candidatesThe bankruptcy court first task is to find those owed money Creditors are usually keen to come forward Not in bankruptcies dealing with crypto For many the attraction of storing wealth this way is its facelessness Lodging a claim requires an id check so creditors must decide quite how deep their desire for privacy runs Investors who include some of tech most illustrious funders are also reluctant to fess up to their involvement To coax them out of hiding the court hasin a highly unusual moveagreed to keep ftx 50 biggest creditors under wraps At the same time Mr Ray is scrambling to locate assets This involves constructing corporate accounts from what he calls the worst record-keeping he has have ever seen ftx did not even keep note of how much customers deposited Billions of dollars were lost by Alameda a sister trading firm Until November 29th lawyers thought there were at least next to no external loans Then BlockFi another bankrupt exchange demanded $500m in shares that ftx held in Robinhood a share-trading platform insisting ftx had put them up as collateral for borrowingSo far Mr Ray has pieced together just a few billion dollars of assets And finding assets is only half the battlegetting at them is harder still In an early fracas American and Bahamian authorities spent months sniping at one another before agreeing to bring tokens worth at least $35bn into American proceedings Mr Ray is also hunting ftx donations Mr Bankman-Fried gave freely to politicians and effective-altruist charities ftx new boss has said he will sue for the moneyAmerican courts have yet to complete a significant crypto restructuring This poses problems Crypto has been around for 15 years but nobody can agree on what it is Token swaps are recorded on virtual ledgers by software on a blockchain which no single person controls This does not fit with property law which assumes people own things because the law says they do or they physically have them in hand Stocks have certificates of ownership; chairs are sat on by their owners In contrast the law does not enforce crypto ledgers and recording something on a blockchain does not conjure a physical coin Thus even creditors that do come forward may not be fully compensated When an exchange trading stocks goes under customers are protected by the Uniform Commercial Code a law that governs commercial transactions in America ftx terms of use explicitly disregard this law On January 4th the judge in another crypto bankruptcy ruled that some of the customers lack ownership rights over their deposits ftx customers may have to wait years to find out what they will receiveIf a settlement is agreed on depositors face a final danger Most of ftx recoverable value will probably be in crypto tokens The one thing such tokens are notlawyers and politicians agreeis currency since money must be backed by a government It seems that when the time comes to carve up ftx assets the court will have to dish out claims in dollars This raises the question of which day exchange rate to use ftx estate holds so many tokens that auctioning them could spark a fire sale burning the tokens’ market value Another route would be to sell accounts to a solvent exchange That would avoid the need to squeeze cash out of tokens no one wants but would keep debris from the worst embarrassment in crypto history floating around for years to comeand require a buyer to be found On January 5th American regulators intervened to stall a deal that would have seen Binance the world largest crypto exchange take on $1bn in assets from Voyager another bankrupt firm There is one certainty from the proceedings to come ftx will go down as it lived: in breathtaking chaos For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 9th 2023,What America protectionist turn means for the world,Step for a moment into the ancient past The year is 2016 Michael Froman the United States Trade Representative is making a stirring call to arms American workers and businesses are competing against firms that get subsidies and other favours from their governments “The question” he says “is what do we do about it? Do we accept this status quo or do we actively work to change it?” Mr Froman choice in line with decades of his country trade policies is the latter: try to tear down the subsidies hurting American exporters and gumming up global tradeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow return to the presentwith a thud America answer to Mr Froman question has been flipped Rather than trying to get other countries to cut subsidies the Biden administration unabashed focus is on building a subsidy architecture of its own complete with the kinds of local-content rules that American officials once railed against Thanks to landmark legislation on semiconductors and greenery passed last year the government is poised to shower $465bn on chips and climate technology Officials have started getting into the nitty-gritty of how to distribute the money; some of the new rules went into effect on January 1st For many in Washingtonboth Democrats and Republicansthis new approach is common sense It is they believe the only way that America can protect its industrial base fend off the challenge from a rising China and reorient the economy towards greener growth But for America allies from Europe to Asia it is a startling shift A country that they had counted on as the stalwart of an open-trading world is instead taking a big step towards protectionism They in turn must decide whether to fight money with money boosting their subsidies to counter America If the result is a global subsidy race the downsides could include a fractured international trading system higher costs for consumers more hurdles to innovation and new threats to political co-operationThe first big crack in America commitment to free trade came when Donald Trump levied tariffs on products from around the world In some ways though it is this second crackthe present ratcheting up of subsidiesthat hurts more “Free trade is dead” is the blunt assessment of a senior Asian diplomat in Washington “It basic game theory When one side breaks the rules others soon break the rules too If you stand still you will lose the most”Although subsidies have long been part of America economic landscape the new plans are notable for both their scale and their America-first emphasis Putting an exact price tag on them is impossible because most of the subsidies will come in the form of tax credits the total size of which will depend on how much companies produce Yet the cumulative impact will be enormous If calculations include infrastructure spending the federal government investment spree may reach $100bn a year over the next decaderoughly twice as much as total subsidies in the pre-pandemic decade Credit Suisse a bank thinks that American solar panels could wind up the cheapest in the world by the late 2020sTo advocates of free trade subsidies are bad in their own right: they make goods produced by one country artificially cheaper reducing economic efficiency America new subsidies are that much more objectionable because in many cases they require recipients to meet local-content thresholds To obtain a $7500 credit towards their purchase of an electric vehicle consumers need to buy a car assembled in North America At least half of the battery components in eligible cars must also be made in North America Wind solar and geothermal projects will all receive heftier subsidies if they use American steel and iron Roughly half of their manufactured components must also be made in America And so the list goes onKilling me lavishlyAmerica protectionist turn has numerous motivations China ascendancy is the starting point American leaders once believed they could get China to rein in the worst of its industrial policies These hopes were dashed giving way to the view that America needs its own industrial policies to avoid becoming reliant on a rival in the technologies of tomorrow Politicians’ concerns about disruption to supply chains early in the covid-19 pandemic strengthened this view as did a desire to boost middle-class jobs Climate change is another reason: spending on renewable energy is expected to lead to a sharp reduction in America carbon emissions The economic thinking that underpins much of this logic is dubious Yet its political momentum is for the time being inexorable That gives rise to two critical questions for countries around the world How big an economic threat are the American subsidies? And how should they respond?As the main target of America measures the answers for China are straightforward Coupled with export controls and sanctions America subsidies are designed to draw business from China This reinforces the Chinese government commitment to greater self-reliance including through its own vast industrial subsidies For America friends though the answers are more complicated When Joe Biden signed America green-tech subsidies into law in August via the Inflation Reduction Act or ira he was met with praise in Europe At last America was on board in the fight against climate change And since everything from cars to supermarkets is bigger in America Mr Biden going big financially was just seen as the American way of doing things Not any more Trade experts in Europe raised the alarm that America subsidies spell trouble for the continent green-tech ambitions Soon enough these concerns percolated up In December Emmanuel Macron the French president called the ira a “killer for our industry” Criticism from America allies in Asia has been more muted but policymakers there are also frustrated by the turn to nationality-based subsidiesThe angrier reaction in Europe is partly because of its weak position The energy crisis provoked by Russia war on Ukraine has hit European firms hard The continent has scrambled to replace cheap piped gas with expensive liquefied gas With its abundant natural resources America has an existing advantage in lower energy prices The new subsidies may give it cheaper renewable power too There is anecdotal evidence that Europe is already losing investment Northvolt a Swedish manufacturer is reviewing its plan for a factory in Germany in favour of its existing American operations Others will follow This readjustment is a source of angst even for some firms Morris Chang founder of tsmc a Taiwanese chipmaker estimates that manufacturing costs in America are 55% higher than in Taiwan Work will be duplicated rather than merely distributed differently The chipmaking giants fret about breaking up networks of expertise in their most advanced manufacturing centres and surrendering the technological leads that sustain their existence Research by Boston Consulting Group suggests investment of between $900bn and $12trn would be required to create multiple self-sufficient semiconductor supply chains around the world with annual operational costs rising by between $45bn and $125bnAt least America semiconductor subsidies do not have the same local-content rules as its green-tech subsidies America allies are now trying to persuade it to soften the latter President Biden suggests America “never intended to exclude folks who were co-operating with us” Practically though it is not easy to recraft the rules Legislation was written precisely specifying amounts timelines and conditions Congress would need to pass formal amendmentsa tall order at the best of times and inconceivable when the House of Representatives is dysfunctional Any adjustments are thus likely to be minor Telling talesGovernments could in theory take America to the World Trade Organisation wto The wto prohibition against subsidies involving local-content requirements is clear Yet so far there is little appetite for such a challenge If America were to lose it could appeal against the ruling which would in effect bring the case to an end since the wto no longer has a viable appellate body thanks to America decision to block appointments Another recourse would be to slap tariffs on American exports benefiting from unfair subsidies That could get very messy Everything from cars to solar panels and hydrogen to semiconductors would be in playInstead governments elsewhere face an invidious choice about whether or not to join the subsidy race There is an economic rationale for staying on the sidelines When America pays for technologies at great cost to its taxpayers these technologies should in time become cheaper for everyone However much America throws at its companies it cannot have a comparative advantage in all products Some officials in Asia cling to the hope that their governments and those in Europe will exercise restraint “That way all non-Americans could have a level playing field with each other” says a Japanese officialBut the voices calling for more subsidies seem to be prevailing The South Korean environment ministry has reportedly informed carmakers that domestic subsidies for electric vehicles could be limited to firms which run their own service centres in the country excluding most foreign companies Japan is making its own efforts to revive the manufacturing of advanced semiconductors Eight domestic firms including Toyota a carmaker and Sony an electronics firm recently announced the formation of a new chipmaking firm Rapidus Then the Japanese government promised ¥70bn $500m in funding for the firm semiconductor research In Europe politicians and businesses want strict state-aid rules to be adjusted so that governments can support industry more lavishly These rules are one of the European single market big success stories helping to ensure competition Politicians including Bruno Le Maire and Robert Habeck the economic ministers of France and Germany and Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission have argued that changes are needed to let more aid flow to strategic sectors more quickly Olaf Scholz the German chancellor is reportedly going to join themAmericans who helped craft the country old trade strategy worry its new approach will backfire Susan Schwab trade representative from 2006 to 2009 argues that many in Europe and Asia will be only too glad to see the doors opened wide to industrial subsidies “We’re never going to subsidise as much or raise as many barriers as our trade partners” she says “So it in our interest that there be a rules-based system and that the rules be enforced”It is an opinion scarcely heard in Washington these days Katherine Tai the current trade representative is a staunch believer in subsidies She has called for America and its allies to co-ordinate their investments in order to maximise their clout Theoretically this is a sound idea America wants allies in Asia and Europe to join its harder line on China; its allies meanwhile want to continue under America security umbrella and would like support in confronting climate changeYet even with the utmost sincerity co-ordination is bound to be fiendishly hard Just as America wants to be at the cutting edge of semiconductor production so do governments in Asia and Europe All have national champions and scores of startups vying for a slice of the action As America and its allies offer more aid these firms will lap it up In the process there will be a duplication of efforts across borders a waste of public funds and recrimination between countries meant to be co-operating It may take hundreds of billions of dollars to relearn why America was once an opponent not an advocate of subsidies For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Jan 5th 2023,Will investors have another awful year in 2023?,After a nightmarish 2022 shell-shocked investors have losses to recoup and plenty to ponder There are asset-class allocations to be made industries to favour or shun and every economic variable under the sun to forecast Professional money managers have the extra headache of working out how to stop nervous clients racing for the exits But one question dominates the rest and it is the impossible one that looms over every crash Is the worst over?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEconomically there is a clear answer: this year will be grim Kristalina Georgieva head of the imf warned on January 1st that a third of the global economy is likely to fall into recession in 2023 Downturns have probably already begun in the euro zone and Britain In a recent poll of economists carried out by the University of Chicago and the Financial Times 85% thought America would follow before the year is outThis does not guarantee another bloodbathit could even mean the opposite In theory markets are forward-looking and fears of recession stalked the world for much of 2022 Such a widely held consensus should be baked into today prices meaning even a marginally better outlook would buoy prices Indeed analysts at JPMorgan Asset Management use the strength of agreement that there will be a recession to argue that stock prices will in fact end 2023 higher than they started They are not alone in their optimism Goldman Sachs researchers think share prices will fall in the near term but recover by the end of the year Deutsche Bank bullish lot reckon the s&p 500 index of large American firms will end the year 17% higher than it now standsIf this year offers a repeat of 2022 with heavy losses for both stocks and bonds it will be an unusual one Stock prices mostly go up They rarely decline two years in a row The s&p 500 last did so two decades ago during the bursting of the dotcom bubble Last year bond rout was on account of the Federal Reserve raising rates at its fastest pace since the 1980s which is unlikely to be repeatedEven so there are reasons to believe more pain lies ahead The first is that shares relative to their underlying earnings remain expensive by historical standards Despite last year plunge the price-to-earnings ratio for “growth” stocks those of companies promising big future profits has fallen back only to where it was in 2019 This was its highest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 a level which was reached after a decade-long bull market True “value” stocks those with a low price compared with the firm book assets look more attractive But as recession sets in both types are vulnerable to earnings downgrades that are for the most part yet to materialise Moreover today valuations were reached during an unusual period: one in which central banks pumped endless liquidity into the market via quantitative easing qe By buying government bonds with newly created money the Fed and others depressed yields and nudged investors to seek returns in riskier assets like stocks Now these qe programmes are being kicked into reverse One consequence is that governments will rely much more on private investors to hold their debt In the fiscal year of 2022-23 America Treasury may need to borrow almost twice as much from investors as it did during each of the two years preceding the covid-19 pandemic and four times the average in the five years before that Even without central banks raising short-term interest rates this glut could drive bond prices down and yields up Just as in 2022 stocks would therefore be left looking less attractive by comparisonThe final reason for gloom is a divergence between economists and investors Although wonks are betting on a recession many punters still hope one can be avoided Markets expect the Fed benchmark rate to hit a peak of below 5% in the first half of this year before declining The central bank governors disagree They project that the interest rate will end the year above 5% Thus investors are betting either that inflation will fall to target more quickly than the Fed expects or that the monetary guardians do not have the heart to inflict the pain it would take to get it down There is of course a chance they will be proved right But markets spent much of 2022 underestimating the Fed hawkishness only to be put in their place by Jerome Powell the central bank governor at meeting after meeting If the pattern repeats 2023 will be another miserable year for investors Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:India stockmarkets are roaring They also have serious faults Dec 20thFor bond investors every country is an emerging market now Dec 8thHas private equity avoided the asset-price crash?

daily life stood still for months on end A cosmopolitan class of young wealthy Chinese was forced to come to grips with a life without international travel Foreign entrepreneurs and executives were

firm compared with what it would have produced had its reopening resembled the rest of the world Restrictions on movement snarled the most advanced global supply chains In November profits at industrial firms dropped by 9% year on year Meanwhile exchanges between China and the outside world fell to their lowest in decades Few foreign students remain Overseas tourism has collapsed Mr Xi has only recently resumed foreign travel after remaining in China for two-and-a-half years Zero-covid lasted longer than anyone initially expected then collapsed faster than anyone could have imagined In a matter of weeks China has gone from some of the world strictest restrictions to almost none For the population at large fear of lockdowns and quarantine has vanished Following a period of turbulence economic activity is likely to rebound sharply Increased demand for energy and commodities will be felt around the world Investors and multinational executives will soon be able to visit offices and

gain strength as the year progresses Li Pengfei until recently a product manager at an industrial-software firm in Beijing is among those desperate for a return to normality Mr Li lost his job in February when restrictions made basic duties such as travelling to meet clients near-impossible He spent part of last year living with his sister but was forced to return home to Jilin province in China far northeast where economic prospects were dismal even before the pandemic “Things seem so volatile that even the big companies are downsizing” he says Elsewhere in the world bosses worry about a “great resignation” with workers quitting jobs or dropping out of the labour force altogether This is less of a concern in China The government did not hand out stimulus cheques willy-nilly as America did during the pandemic People who lost jobs such as Mr Li will return to work when the opportunity arises economists believe helping to steady factory outputXi spending spreeConsumption will rise too Incomes have fallen but zero-covid also squashed spending as people avoided travelling and eating out All told households saved one-third of their income last year Many will be getting back on their feet after job losses stagnating pay and declines in the value of their homes meaning the splurge will be limited But Jacqueline Rong of bnp Paribas a bank reckons household consumption will

opposed to speculative purchases To that end they may make further cuts to mortgage rates and down-payment requirementsForecasts for the performance of the property sector broadly defined to include construction services and furnishings range widely Activity in the industry could grow by 3% this year according to Jing Liu of hsbc a bankenough to add 09 percentage points to China gdp growth A more optimistic scenario has activity expanding by 5% she thinks adding 15 points to growth Some households might decide that now is a good time to “buy the dip” before prices revive or regulatory restrictions on home purchases return The economic implications of reopening extend further afield Zero-covid kept a lid on China demand for global goods services and commodities During the lockdown of Shanghai in the first half of last year for instance the country oil demand fell by 2m barrels per day In the past such drops in Chinese spending would have deprived the world economy of a crucial engine of growth The covid downturn has been different It coincided with an overheated economy in America and an interrupted supply of energy across Europe “At least this time China isn’t contributing to inflation” says Louis Kuijs of s&p Global a rating agencyChina recovery will lift global growth for the simple reason that the country is a large part of the world economy hsbc reckons that one year from now in the first quarter of 2024 China gdp could be as much as 10% higher than it will be in the first three troubled months of 2023 see chart 1 According to our rough calculation a recovering China could account for two-thirds of global growth in that period In time however China recovery may have unfortunate side-effects In other big economies the binding constraint on economic expansion is monetary policy as central banks raise interest rates to suppress inflation If China reopening looks like raising global demand and therefore price pressure to an uncomfortable degree central banks elsewhere may have to respond by tightening policy to offset the threat In such a scenario the impact of China reopening on the rest of the world may show up not in higher growth but in higher inflation or interest rates China most direct channel of influence is through commodities It consumes almost one-fifth of the world oil over half of refined copper nickel and zinc and more than three-fifths of iron ore On November 4th the mere rumour of a reopening caused a 7% increase in the price of copper by the end of the day As the rumours are realised China demand for metals crops and energy will help exporters of commodities hurt importers and give the world central banks another headache in their fight against inflationHeavy metal demandChina appetite for metals remained strong during zero-covid as the government encouraged spending on electric vehicles renewable energy and other forms of green infrastructure all of which require lots of aluminium copper and other metals But buyers lacked the confidence to stock up on these materials: inventories of copper fell to their skimpiest in 15 years Reopening will encourage restocking In November Goldman Sachs a bank reckoned the price of copper would increase to $9000 per tonne within 12 months Now it thinks the price will reach $11000 Demand for energy proved less resilient particularly towards the end of zero-covid China imports of liquefied natural gas lng fell by about one-fifth in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year This allowed Europe to increase purchases to make up for the loss of Russian gas Thus China zero-covid policy acted as a counterweight to Russia invasion of Ukraineone blunder helping to save Europe from the otherAnalysts assume a modest rise in Chinese lng imports this year based on the contracts buyers have already signed and their reluctance to buy lng when prices are high If imports recover faster Europe could feel the pinch In a stress test in December the International Energy Agency iea an official forecaster assumed Chinese demand would increase by about a quarter in the year ahead returning to 2021 levels; Russia would cut off piped gas to Europe entirely; and winter would start punctually In such a scenario Europe would face a shortfall of 27bn cubic metres of gas equivalent to 7% of annual demand even after its current efforts to increase supply are taken into account The iea warns that if nothing else is done Europe may be forced to introduce rationing The impact on oil could also be significant If China economy makes a full recovery in 2023 it will gradually increase crude imports throughout the year until it has added an average of 1m barrels a day reckons Soni Kumari of anz a bank This will compensate for reduced demand in Europe and America both of which are courting recession Indeed Goldman Sachs forecasts that China increased appetite could push up oil prices by about $15 per barrel The price of Brent could exceed $100 again in the third quarter of this year it reckons making the global battle against inflation still more difficultHigher commodity prices will be a boon to exporters like Chile and Brazil but hurt China energy-importing neighbours For India the loss from higher prices may cancel out gains from increased exports to the mainland Other countries more tightly enmeshed in China manufacturing supply chain seem better placed to benefit But raw statistics can be deceptive Although Taiwan merchandise exports to the mainland were equivalent to more than 15% of gdp in 2021 many were components for products that are ultimately sold to customers outside China and may thus be unaffected by the change of policyThe biggest boost to neighbours will come not from selling goods to China but from selling tourist destinations to Chinese citizens see chart 2 Ni Na a mother of two from Shanghai travelled overseas about five times a year pre-pandemic often spending three or four months a year outside the country She attempted to travel once within China in 2022 only to give up owing to restrictions When quarantine requirements are lifted Ms Ni will get back on the road She has renewed her passport and her sons’ travel documents in anticipation  China leap forwardThailand a popular destination could enjoy a three-percentage-point boost to growth once China has fully reopened reckons Goldman Sachs That would remove the uncertainty weighing on local asset prices including the currency says Arup Raha of Oxford Economics reducing pressure on the central bank to raise rateswelcome freedom in a country where output is still below potential But the biggest winner will be Hong Kong Increased exports which include tourism could boost its gdp by almost 8% after full reopening The city used to attract more than 4m mainland visitors a month Without them it has felt roomier but poorerThe Communist Party is deft at rewriting history Yet Mr Xi will struggle to shake the damage done to his reputation in 2022 The clumsy enforcement of zero-covid followed by its hasty abandonment will go down as an error for the ages Many investment houses adjusted their risk assessments for China and will allocate less to the country over the next three years unless they are compensated for it About $18bn of foreign exchange flowed out of China in November up from $11bn in October These outflows are expected to reverse when China economy stabilises in 2023 but a swift return to the type of inflows witnessed before the pandemic is unlikelyDeep damage has been done to parts of China supply chain A covid outbreak followed by protests at a plant making Apple iPhone 14 in central China has delayed orders for the product For foreign firms the crisis was the first time that central policy interfered with local officials’ commitment to keep factories running Many companies are now willing to pay more to manufacture elsewhere Take the process of launching new products which requires an almost continuous flow of researchers and scientists between headquarters usually in the West and plants in China The covid years made this dance impossible Engineers stopped visiting; fewer new products were launched in the country Multinational firms have been forced often reluctantly to launch elsewhereBut after years of zero-covid bosses have become more comfortable with moving away from China Inbound investment in new “greenfield” factories has plummeted see chart 3 At the same time the number of firms moving operations out of China has jumped says Alex Bryant of East West Associates a supply-chain consultant Most of the moves Mr Bryant firm has assisted with over the past year have been outbound He thinks the reopening of China is unlikely to lead to an immediate turnaround in the direction of trafficA thousand meetingsPolicymakers are waking up to the danger Officials and businessfolk from Fujian Guangdong Sichuan Zhejiang and elsewhere are planning trips abroad to win back investors according to a state-media report “A meeting is worth a thousand emails” it said In December China leaders announced a focus on attracting foreign money emphasising that local governments should prioritise finding investors Such language has not been used at a Politburo meeting in many years notes Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley a bank “They clearly want to keep their place in the global supply chain” he says Nevertheless making up for the chaos of 2022 will require an awful lot of meetings For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance

 Dec 29th 2022,In 2022 Russia kept the economic show on the road,The past year has been bruising for Russia economy Foreign investors fled en masse many never to return Official forecasts suggest that few countries will see their gdp shrink by more this year Only a handful of countries including war-torn Ukraine will end up posting worse numbers From another perspective however Russia did surprisingly well In the days following its invasion of Ukraine in February there was financial chaos from Moscow to Vladivostok After Western countries imposed an unprecedented number of sanctions the stockmarket collapsed along with the rouble At the time it seemed Vladimir Putin “Fortress Russia” was crumblingEconomists quickly downgraded their forecasts Within days the consensus estimate of annual gdp growth in 2022 dropped from 25% to a contraction of 10% Some economists were even gloomier: the White House looked for a year-on-year decline in Russian gdp of 15% Inflation surged across the countryRussia faced a squeeze on both the supply and demand sides of the economy Western businesses were pulling out by the dozen limiting what Russians could buy Meanwhile the central bank doubled interest rates raising debt-servicing costs and thus further squeezing demandWithin a few weeks however it became clear that the worst forecasts were not going to come to pass Sanctions have gravely damaged parts of Russia industrial base such as the car sector which relies on foreign parts Others in particular those enjoined by the state to help out with the war effort have not done too badly During the summer and the autumn economists revised up their growth forecasts Now they expect the Russian economy to shrink by some 3-4% this year Unemployment has barely budged in part because firms have been told to keep workers on even if on lower or no pay Two main reasons explain why Russia downturn has proved shallower than expected: policy and trade In the early days of the invasion the quick actions of the central bank and regulators convinced ordinary Russians that they were serious about tackling surging inflation Inflation expectations having jumped came back down again Higher interest rates encouraged the public to return money that they had taken out from their bank accounts in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic preventing a financial crisis Sanctions have been tough but for most of 2022 there were few restrictions on the sale of hydrocarbons that is now changing So far this year Russia has racked up a current-account surplus of over $220bn twice its level the year before This foreign currency has helped finance imports Many Western firms have stopped selling their goods and services to Russia But companies in other parts of the world are only too happy to helpChina for instance have stepped up Turkey appears to have become a go-between for Western companies looking to skirt sanctions Russian imports have recovered a long way after a sharp drop in the spring“Real-time” economic data paint a concerning picture for the West At present the Russian economy is in better shape than expected Meanwhile Europe weighed down by sky-high energy costs is falling into recession 
 Dec 21st 2022,Five financial trends that 2022 killed,Financial markets’ nastiest surprises often come when something that is taken for granted is suddenly called into questionwhether it rising tulip-bulb prices functioning banks or a lockdown-free existence Investors had a tough time in 2022 But given how many trends changed direction over the course of the year the real surprise is that it was not nastier Here were the most important reversalsEnd of cheap moneyFuture financial historians looking back at the 2010s will marvel that people really thought interest rates would stay near zero forever Even in 2021 respectable investment houses were publishing articles with titles such as: “The Zero: Why interest rates will stay low” Borrowing costs had been falling for decades; the combination of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and the covid-19 pandemic seemed to have permanently glued them to the floor In 2022 persistent high inflation dissolved the glue America Federal Reserve embarked on its swiftest tightening cycle since the 1980s raising the target range for its benchmark interest rate by more than four percentage points to 425-45% Other central banks followed in its wake Markets expect rates to stop climbing in 2023 with peaks of between 45% and 5% in Britain and America and 3% and 35% in the euro zone But the odds of them collapsing back to nothing are slim The Fed governors for instance think its rate will finish 2023 above 5% before settling down to around 25% in the longer run The era of free money is over Death of the long bull marketBull markets don’t die of old age goes the adage: they are murdered by central banks And so it was in 2022 although the long bull run that ended had grown older than most From the post-financial crisis depths of 2009 to its peak at the end of 2021 the s&p 500 index of leading American shares rose by 600% Interruptions to the upwards marchsuch as the sudden drop at the outset of the pandemicwere dramatic but short-lived This year crash has proved lasting The s&p 500 fell by a quarter to its lowest point this year in mid-October and remains down 20% msci index of global shares has fallen by 20% Nor are stocks the only asset class to have been bludgeoned Share prices have fallen in part because interest rates have risen raising the returns on bonds and making riskier assets less attractive by comparison The same mechanism pushed down bond prices to align their yields with prevailing rates Indices compiled by Bloomberg a data provider of global American European and emerging-market bonds have dropped by 16% 12% 18% and 15% respectively Whether or not prices fall further the “bull market in everything” has come to a closeEvaporating capitalCapital was not just cheap in the last years of the bull market it was seemingly everywhere Central banks’ quantitative easing qe programmes devised during the financial crisis to stabilise markets went into overdrive during the pandemic Together the central banks of America Britain euro area and Japan pumped out more than $11trn of newly created money using it to hoover up “safe” assets such as government bonds and depress their yieldsThis pushed investors in search of returns into more speculative corners of the market In turn these assets boomed In the decade to 2007 American firms issued $100bn of the riskiest high-yield or “junk” debt a year In the 2010s they averaged $270bn In 2021 they hit $486bnThis year it has fallen by three-quarters The Fed and the Bank of England have put their bond-buying programmes into reverse; the European Central Bank is preparing to do likewise Liquidity is draining away and not just from the risky end of the debt market Initial-public offerings ipos smashed all records in 2021 raising $655bn globally Now American ipos are set for their leanest year since 1990 The value of mergers and acquisitions has fallen too albeit less dramatically Capital abundance has turned to capital scarcityValue beats growthThe bull run was a dispiriting time for “value” investors who hunt for stocks that are cheap relative to their underlying earnings or assets Low interest rates and qe-fuelled risk-taking put this cautious approach firmly out of fashion Instead “growth” stocks promising explosive future profits at a high price compared with their often non-existent current earnings stormed ahead From March 2009 to the end of 2021 msci index of global growth stocks rocketed by a factor of 64 more than twice the increase of the equivalent value indexThis year rising interest rates turned the tables With rates at 1% to have $100 in ten years’ time you must deposit $91 in a bank account today With rates at 5% you need only put away $61 The end of cheap money shortens investors’ horizons forcing them to prefer immediate profits to those in the distant future Growth stocks are out Value is back in vogueCrypto implodes againThose who think crypto is good for nothing but gambling and dubious activities could not hope for a better example than the fall of ftx The crypto exchange was also supposedly the industry respectable face run by Sam Bankman-Fried a 30-year-old philanthropist and political donor Yet in November the firm collapsed into bankruptcy with some $8bn of customer funds missing American authorities now call it a “massive years-long fraud” Mr Bankman-Fried has been arrested and faces criminal charges If convicted he could spend the rest of his life in jailftx downfall marked the bursting of crypto most recent bubble At its peak in 2021 the market value of all cryptocurrencies was almost $3trn up from nearly $800bn at the start of the year It has since fallen back to around $800bn Like so much else the affair roots lie in the era of cheap abundant money and the anything-goes mentality it created 
 Dec 21st 2022,2022 has been a year of brutal inflation,“Low inflation is indeed the problem of this era” Thus said John Williams president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in late 2019 espousing the dominant view at the time Fast forward to the present and the problem is the exact opposite Just about every country in the world has grappled with soaring prices in 2022 The situation is all but certain to improve in the coming year but at a severe cost to economic growthWhat made 2022 so unusual was the breadth of price pressures The global rate of inflation will finish the year at roughly 9% For many developing countries high inflation is a recurrent challenge But the last time that inflation was so elevated in rich countries was the early 1980s In America consumer prices are on track to have risen by about 7% in 2022 the highest in four decades In Germany the rate will be closer to 10% its first bout of double-digit inflation since 1951The common factors driving up inflation everywhere were soaring fuel and food costs Prices for many consumer goods were already trending up at the start of 2022 because of covid-19 lingering impact on supply chains Russia invasion of Ukraine in February proved even more disruptive The cost of oil climbed by a third as Western countries slapped sanctions on Russia a major crude producer Food prices also surged pushed up by fertiliser and transportation costs as well as by Russia blockades of grain exports from Ukraine a major wheat producer In economic terms this amounted to a classic supply shock The sudden rise in prices for key commodities quickly filtered into daily life for the world citizens In Europe long reliant on Russian gas millions will struggle to afford heating this winter Across all regions food and fuel accounted on average for more than half of inflation in 2022 see chartWere inflation just a supply-side phenomenon it would have been painful enough But the most worrying development for central bankers was that pressures seeped into “core” components of price indicesthat is goods and services other than volatile food and energy The rise in core prices was an indication that inflation was gathering momentum all of its own That in turn pointed to causes beyond the oil shock Many countries now have ultra-tight labour markets partly a result of a wave of early retirements during covid As a result companies are paying higher wages to attract workers adding to inflationary momentum In America where the rise in core inflation was particularly steep an additional culprit was excessive stimulusby both the government and the Fedat the height of covid For much of 2022 that translated into overheated demand with real personal spending higher than the pre-pandemic trend Tellingly the big economy with the lowest inflation was China Its “zero-covid” strategy pushed spending far below the pre-pandemic trendAlmost everywhere there was anxiety that rising prices would reset people inflation expectations leading them to demand higher pay Known as a wage-price spiral such a dynamic would make inflation far harder to eradicate The mere threat of the dynamic was sufficient to stir central banks to action The Fed was the most aggressive raising interest rates from a floor of zero in March to more than 4% today its sharpest dose of monetary tightening in four decades Central banks throughout the rich world from Stockholm to Sydney followed in its wakeOne way of looking at inflation prospects for 2023 is as a duel between rebounding supply and falling demand Promisingly some of the factors that fuelled inflation early in 2022 have started to fade Prices of consumer goods have declined as supply chains have returned to normal The cost of oil has fallen back to its level a year ago in part thanks to a recovery in production Tighter monetary policy works by choking off demand and that is starting to happen too The most rate-sensitive sectors are suffering the most: a sudden chill has settled over once-sizzling property markets with transactions drying up If the recovery in supplyincluding crucially of willing workersis big and fast enough central banks may be able to stop tightening before provoking a deep recession But at this point it seems more likely that they will exact a real toll on the global economy In 2023 fears of inflation may give way to concerns about unemployment 
 Dec 20th 2022,2023 will bring the true test of the West oil-war tactics,The west has been trying to cut Russia oil-export revenues without causing global prices to spike since February Both aims are seemingly being achieved at present Russia exports as much oil as before its invasion of Ukraine but Urals crude the main grade it pumps trades at a 37% discount to Brent the global benchmark meaning Moscow gets a poor deal Brent meanwhile has fallen to an annual low of around $80 a barrel see chart meaning consumers face less of an energy crunch Little of this is down to Western efforts On December 14th and 15th central banks in America Britain and the eu announced interest-rate rises and signalled more would come sucking demand from the economy China reeling from soaring covid-19 cases posted its worst factory and retail data in six months Members of the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries opec and its allies are producing nearly as much as before a cut to their collective target was announced in October since most were already pumping below their quotasThe West boycott of Urals which accounts for 10-15% of the world crude supply is probably bringing its price down a bit as the grade undercuts others An exemption to Europe ban on insurance for tankers carrying Russian oil which applies to buyers that agree to pay a maximum of $60 per barrel may be helping to prevent a supply shock But neither measure is having a huge impact If economic or market conditions change prices could jumpMoreover financial punters seem to have had a greater hand than usual in depressing recent prices which could portend a sudden upwards correction when the fundamentals of supply and demand kick back in An industry source points to large “sell” orders being placed every day at 2pm London time in recent weeks Events that should push up prices such as the shutdown of the Keystone pipeline in America one of the world largest on December 9th seem to have barely registered notes Saad Rahim of Trafigura a trading firm By the second quarter of 2023 there may be another oil shortage Industrial users in Europe are switching from natural gas to cheaper gasoil Consumption in India and the Middle East is proving more resilient than expected China reopening will probably fuel an economic rebound after cases peak There are already signs that Europe insurance ban could end up proving more disruptive than expected The iea an official forecaster reckons Russia will be forced to cut output by 16m b/d to 96m b/d by the second quarter Loadings of a minor Russian grade called ESPO which unlike Urals recently traded above $60 have nearly halved since December 5th when the cap was introduced Should rising oil demand push the price of Urals above $60 ship owners may well have second thoughts about carrying it too Russia has threatened to cut supply to countries that abide by the cap and growth elsewhere is projected to be sluggish A deficit in global supply would eat into already slim global stocks which remain close to five-year lows causing prices to rise still further All this means that the true test of the West oil-war tactics will probably arrive next year 
 Dec 20th 2022,The Federal Reserve great anti-hero deserves a second look,Since inflation took off a former Federal Reserve chair has been on the minds of politicians and pundits A number have argued that Jerome Powell the current incumbent must not become the next Arthur Burns As chair of the Fed in the 1970s Burns represents central-banking failure: a weak leader who blinked in the face of inflation and steered the economy towards disaster Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is not that this warning from history is incorrect Richard Nixon picked Burns to run the Fed viewing him as a friend who would do his bidding Despite stubborn inflation Nixon pressed Burns to cut interest rates in 1971 thinking it would help him win re-election Sure enough the Fed did just that Nixon was re-elected and inflation soared hitting double digits by 1974But the story is more complicated than the basic outlines suggest and its complexity contains lessons for today policymakers With the holiday season upon usand with the Fed approaching a turning point in monetary policyit is a fine time to reassess the legacy of the much-maligned central bankerStart with what happened after inflation took off The Fed jacked up interest rates from 3% in 1972 to 13% in 1974 one of its sharpest-ever doses of tightening and enough to help tip the economy into a deep recession Doing so took some of the heat out of price growth with inflation settling at around 6% for the remainder of Burns tenure This was uncomfortably high and Burns never delivered the death blow to inflation that Paul Volcker did in the early 1980s Nevertheless his initial assault heralded a new era In 2016 economists from the Fed branch in Richmond assessed monetary-policy settings over the years Their model suggested that the “Volcker shock” had not appeared like a bolt from the blue Burns had laid the groundwork for itHe did this in formidable circumstances An oil shock that began in 1973 led to a near quadrupling in energy prices as well as a surge in food costs A second oil shock in 1978 just after Burns left the Fed kicked off another inflationary surge Given this backdrop how much of the inflation can truly be blamed on the Fed? A review written in 2008 by Alan Blinder and Jeremy Rudd two economists found that supply-side factors were decisive They calculated that the energy and food crises accounted for more than 100% of the rise in headline inflation relative to its baseline level The Fed could have reacted more strongly given that inflation had already been unanchored But Burns was not responsible for the massive shocks facing the economyBurns troubles also illustrate the pitfalls of real-time indicators The Fed today is seen as “data-dependent” If inflation momentum stays relatively weak its next rate rise is likely to be one quarter of a percentage point; if inflation shoots back up a half-point rise may be on the menu That is entirely reasonable But consider the head-fake of 1975 Initial data from the first quarter registered a 10% annualised drop in gdp and a remission in price pressure The Fed cut rates aggressively Subsequent revisions showed that the gdp loss was only about 5% and that inflation had remained persistent If this had been known at the time Burns Fed might well have acted differentlyThat real-time figures may be flawed is on one level not terribly helpful: it is impossible to know whether future revisions will push growth up or down Yet this uncertainty does counsel against overreacting to limited data Having tightened policy so much over the past year the Fed wants to proceed more gingerly Even if there is an upside surprise in inflation between now and its next meeting in February sticking to that gradualism may still be the right coursejust as Mr Powell has avoided reading too much into an apparent inflation slowdown in NovemberThe main economic outcome associated with Burns Fed is of course high inflation But his relatively loose policy also fuelled an investment boom Capital expendituresthat is money spent by businesses on things such as buildings and equipmentreached about a third of American gdp in 1978 which still stands as the highest level since at least 1946 Responding to the supply shocks at the time much of that went into energy and commodity production Jeffrey Currie of Goldman Sachs a bank recently noted that these investments helped to “de-bottleneck” oil and metals production capacity for decades setting the economy up for lower inflation in the long runToday the world economy is at another inflection point The frayed global trading system declining immigration and climate change may well constrain America productivity leading to persistently lower growth and higher inflation There is also renewed debate among economists about whether the Fed should pursue a slightly higher inflation target than 2% Such a switch could help it to avoid squeezing the economy too hard amid profound challenges The Fed task is to accurately forecast the future shape of the economy and its interaction with monetary policy The deep effects of the 1970s’ investment boom are a reminder that it must pay heed to the current array of economic structural shiftsFirst-degree BurnsThe closer one examines Burns record the more that complexities emerge The former Fed chair carefully managed the dissolution of a major bank in 1974 in an augury of the central bank present framework of letting bad firms fail so long as doing so does not precipitate a financial crisis His advocacy of wage controls is now seen as a classic example of bad policy doomed to failure Yet the context was a powerful union movement which had locked in upward cost-of-living adjustmentssomething that no longer exists Even his relationship with Nixon is far from straightforward Burns was no sycophant and did at least try to resist the president bullying All this provides the final and most important lesson from the Fed great anti-hero: historical analogies are useful but rarely the whole story Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The insidious threats to central-bank independence Dec 15thTackling sexual harassment could bring sizeable economic dividends Dec 8thA playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation Dec 1stFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 20th 2022,China leaders ponder an economy without lockdownsor crackdowns,Each december the leaders of China Communist Party gather to discuss their “economic work” for the year ahead The lengthy statement they then release to the public provides a clue to their thinking and priorities But by the time the leaders met on December 15th and 16th in Beijing the most fateful economic choice of the next 12 months had already been madeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhether by accident or design local officials did not impose lockdowns in November on anything like the scale required to stop a widespread covid-19 outbreak Their decision if that is what it can be called has brought an abrupt end to China “zero-covid” policy Now unable to defeat the virus China central government says it is too mild to be worth vanquishingThis will be a great boon to China economyeventually Before the country can reach that happier future it will have to navigate the world last great infection wave According to hsbc a bank growth could fall below zero in the first quarter of 2023 compared with a year earlierThe economy faces near-term threats to both supply and demand Some members of the workforce will fall ill; others will take time off to look after stricken relatives Schools have moved online in parts of China trapping parents at home As hospitals fill local officials may try again to slow the disease spread by limiting traffic between regions gumming up logistics The bigger threat is to confidence and spending Many Chinese came to resent the “zero-covid” regime but lots still fear the disease According to a survey by Bank of America some 61% will stay home or go out less as infections rise In November retail sales fell by more than 7% adjusted for inflation compared with a year earlier In Beijing where the virus is spreading rapidly shopping centres are unusually quiet even as fever clinics and some bars are packed with people seeking relief for their body or spirit The threat of infection in the country capital is so bad the National Bureau of Statistics cancelled its regular press conference reviewing the month economic figuresas good an indicator of China predicament as anything the bureau normally publishesThus the country leaders will have their economic work cut out in 2023 But you would not necessarily know that from reading their statement Just as China headline economic statistics are often suspiciously smooth the statements China releases after its economic work conference are also artificially consistent They repeat phrases “proactive fiscal policy” and slogans “housing is for living in not for speculation” from previous years Presumably the aim is to create the impression of stability and continuity In last week statement China abrupt swerve away from the “zero-covid” policy is mentioned only in passing The statement notes that China will focus on the elderly and vulnerable and calibrate its response to infections to “get through the latest covid-19 pandemic period smoothly”The statement does though recognise some of the dangers of a post-zero-covid world China leaders must revive market confidence at home and restore China appeal to investors abroad most of whom have not visited for years “Improving public confidence and expectations” is listed as a good starting point for economic strategy in 2023 To foreign investors China leaders promise “maximum convenience”The statement also provides a rare acknowledgment of criticism or what it calls “incorrect” interpretations It addresses the view that China has become inhospitable to private enterprise and indisposed to reforming its big state-owned enterprises Examples include a clampdown on indebted property developers and a regulatory blitz that humbled some of the country most successful e-commerce firms in 2021 In response the statement promises China will make clear its adherence to the “two unswervings” the name the party gives to its double commitment to consolidate the state sector and support the private sector Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley another bank thinks China regulatory macroeconomic and covid policies are aligned in favour of growth for the first time in three years Others are more sceptical The government attempt to repair confidence is like breaking a horse into pieces reassembling it and expecting it to run again according to one netizen The doubters will want to see more evidence that China is as committed to private enterprise as it is to its market-friendly slogans Official rhetoric is not always a good guide to policy If it were China would still be persisting victoriously with zero-covid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 20th 2022,The Bank of Japan shocks investors,In recent months anticipation had grown that in 2023 the Bank of Japan boj would at last tighten monetary policy after years of no-holds-barred stimulus Almost nobody expected it to happen in 2022 But on December 20th the bank lifted its cap on ten-year government-bond yields from 025% to 05% The Christmas surprise caused the yen to surgeand set off speculation about what might come nextListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSince 2016 the boj has intervened in bond markets to keep the ten-year bond yield at around 0% a policy known as “yield-curve control” Technically the bank permitted fluctuations of a quarter of a percentage point around the 0% goal But the upper limit of 025% is what mattered especially this year as upward pressure on yields built around the globe Now the boj will allow moves of half a percentage point around zero After the announcement the ten-year bond yield surged from 025% to 04% its biggest daily shift since 2003The boj had been a global outlier maintaining ultra-loose policy even as America Federal Reserve and other central banks chose to raise interest rates sharply Japan benchmark interest rate of -01% has not moved in almost seven years and the bank owns over half of the government bond market Yield-curve control was implemented as a way of allowing the boj to control long-term interest rates without running out of bonds to buy Paradoxically when central banks credibly promise to peg the price of an asset they often need not intervene much to enforce the policy The market implements the peg by itselfFor most of the policy history that more or less worked In 2022 however the peg has come under considerable pressure as traders have speculated that monetary policy would need to be tightened The chasm between the policies of Japan and those in the rest of the rich world caused the yen to plunge by 23% against the dollar from the start of 2022 to mid-October In October annual inflation was 36% a 40-year high and well above the BOJ 2% target Though most of the inflation was imported many central banks have been caught out since the covid-19 pandemic by assuming price growth will cool without tighter monetary policyYet it was widely assumed that any pivot by the boj would come after its current governor Kuroda Haruhiko leaves in April That policymakers moved faster makes sense: it spares the boj months of bond-buying to enforce the old cap and the greater losses it would endure on its bigger bond portfolio How far will Japan central bank now go? After the announcement the dollar fell by 34% against the yen but the Japanese currency remains at its weakest level in two decades Economists are watching the shunto Japan springtime wage negotiations between large companies and trade unions for more signs of inflation Japanese firms raised winter bonuses by 97% according to Nikkei a business newspaper the largest such increase since 1975Mr Kuroda claims that he has not tightened monetary policy only responded to volatile market conditions Yet the announcement was his “sayonara present” according to Jesper Koll of Monex Group a Japanese brokerage “It opens the door for ‘Operation Freedom’ for whoever his successor will be” Japanese financial markets could be in for a turbulent 2023 For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 18th 2022,2022 unlikely economic winners,In financial terms the past year has been bad for almost everyone Inflation of 10% year-on-year across the rich world has slashed household incomes Investors have lost out as global stockmarkets have plunged by 20% Yet this poor aggregate performance hides wide differences: some countries have done pretty well Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo assess these differences The Economist has compiled data on five economic and financial indicatorsgdp inflation inflation breadth stockmarket performance and government debtfor 34 mostly rich countries We have ranked each economy according to how well it has done on these measures and created an overall score The table at the end of this article shows the rankings It includes some unexpected results For the first time in a while the economic party is happening in the Mediterranean Top of our list is Greece Other countries that plumbed the economic depths in the early 2010s including Portugal and Spain also score highly They are not the only pleasant surprises Despite political chaos Israel did well Meanwhile despite political stability Germany is an underperformer Two Baltic countries Estonia and Latvia which won plaudits in the 2010s for speedy reforms come bottom gdp usually the best measure of economic health is our first indicator Norway helped by high oil prices and Turkey by a boom in sanctions-busting trade with Russia have done better than most The fallout from covid-19 also looms large Thanks to strict lockdowns and a collapse in tourism a year ago much of southern Europe was in dire straits so the region was due a decent year Visits to the Balearics recently rebounded beyond their pre-pandemic level As your correspondent discovered on a recent trip to Ibiza the island is so busy it is difficult to book a taxi or find a spot at a half-decent restaurantIreland probably had a strong year though one not nearly as strong as gdp numbers suggest The activities of big multinational companies many registered there for tax purposes have for years distorted the figures By contrast America gdp numbers are misleadingly weak: in recent quarters official statisticians have struggled to account for the impact of enormous stimulus packages More granular data fill in the picture Our second measure is the change in the price level since the end of 2021 Away from the world attention some countries have seen low inflation In Switzerland consumer prices have risen by just 3% The country central bank helped along by a strong currency responded rapidly to the rise in prices earlier this year Countries which have non-Russian energy sourcessuch as Spain which gets much of its gas from Algeriahave also done better than average Those reliant on Vladimir Putin for fuel have truly suffered In Latvia average consumer prices have risen by a fifth Our third measure also relates to inflation It calculates the share of items in each country inflation basket where prices have risen by more than 2% in the past year This provides an indication of how entrenched inflation isand therefore hints at how quickly inflation will fall over the coming year Some countries that suffer from high headline inflation have nonetheless been able to limit its breadth In Italy for instance average consumer prices have risen by 11% this year yet “only” two-thirds of its inflation basket has above-target inflation Japanese inflation also looks like it may fade away Britain is in more trouble The price of every category in its basket is rising fast People sense of economic well-being does not just come from prices in the shops They also look at the value of their pension pots and stock portfolios In some countries it has been a terrible year for these sorts of investments Share prices in both Germany and South Korea are down by nearly a fifth in 2022 double America decline Swedish stocks have done even worse Yet there are a few spots of strength Norway stockmarket is up on the year So is Britain which is populated by the sort of dull plodding companies that tend to be rewarded when economic times are tough A fall in the value of the pound has also increased the value of foreign salesOur final measure concerns the change in net government debt as a share of gdp In the short run ministers are able to paper over economic cracks by increasing spending or cutting taxes However this can create more debt and thus the need to turn the fiscal screws in the future Some governments have spent extravagantly to cope with the cost-of-living squeeze Germany has allocated funds worth about 7% of gdp to help with sky-high energy costs meaning its debt-to-gdp ratio has risen Other countries have pulled back from the splurge helping to right the fiscal ship Assisted by high inflation public debt in southern European countries seems to be on the way down Will the gap between 2022 winners and losers persist in 2023? Before long southern Europe economic growth weighed down by rapidly ageing populations and high debts will surely fall back to the region usual less-than-stellar levels And there are hopeful signs that in countries such as America and Britain high inflation may finally be easing which would help them up the rankings Along other dimensions differences are likely to persist not least when it comes to those countries reliant on Mr Putin for their energy supplies Against the odds many managed to replenish their stores of natural gas before winter set inbut only by paying outrageous prices With supplies now largely cut off the coming year will be a lot more difficult That will be a big concern in the Baltics but less so on the other side of Europe It is hard to worry about gas supplies while eating a giant plate of squid on an Ibicencan beach For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 15th 2022,The struggle to put a carbon price on a flight,Few topics annoy green activists as much as air travel Planes account for a sliver of total carbon-dioxide emissions roughly 25%but unlike heating other transport and electricity journeys on them are often luxuries not essentials Air travel has also largely escaped carbon pricing which covers a quarter of all emissions Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChange is in the air however Since the start of last year a un-backed scheme has required airlines to offset emissions above a baseline by buying credits On December 6th the eu decided to bring airlines deeper into its carbon-trading scheme These are steps in the right direction even if they are unlikely to bring about fast enough decarbonisation for Europe to hit its goal of a net-zero aviation industry by 2050The ideal carbon-pricing scheme would apply across the economy allowing trade-offs to be made between different activities If society decided that flying was especially important there would be fewer permits for steelmaking The price of carbon would reflect both the ease of substituting a less polluting energy source and the value of the activity it fuels The faulty logic behind excluding airlines from the eu scheme was that there was not yet a viable alternative for jet fuel It was thought a carbon price on flights would simply annoy flyers and push airlines elsewhere But there are ways of reducing the carbon intensity of a flight More efficient aircraft help as does smarter pricing to ensure every seat is used Even without a carbon price the carbon intensity of a passenger kilometre has fallen from around 14kg of carbon dioxide in 1960 to 01kg in 2018 Carbon prices can also change the behaviour of consumers encouraging them to opt for a train bus or boat where available Handing out free permits to airlines amounted to an implicit subsidy for flying The eu new plan will see airlines lose more of these permits each year until the industry special carbon allowances are phased out entirely in 2026 a year sooner than had been intended Britain and Switzerland are included but flights to other countries outside the bloc will remain exempt This is mostly the result of a spat in 2012 when China threatened to stop buying planes from Airbus a European firm and America threatened non-compliance if the eu required all flights to take partInternational airlines will still have to hew to the un-backed scheme which is known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation corsia and applies to the whole industry Under corsia an airline must offset emissions beyond a baseline by buying credits with the split based on the airline share of total industry emissions For the pilot stage which runs until the end of 2023 the baseline is industry emissions in 2019 As airlines have not fully recovered from the covid-19 pandemic there is currently no requirement to offset emissions From 2024 the baseline will be lowered to 85% of emissions in 2019 Yet even this will not have much impact Credits are cheap costing about $3 a tonne compared with around €90 $96 a tonne in the eu And airlines may be able to avoid buying them at all by using a bit of sustainable aviation fuel made from waste cooking oil which is heavily subsidised in America So far nowhere has opted for a carbon-pricing scheme that operates across the whole economy By incorporating airlines into its carbon-trading scheme Europe is at least heading in the right direction But with the scheme limitations and with the rest of the world lagging behind the journey to a net-zero aviation industry will be a slow one For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 15th 2022,The insidious threats to central-bank independence,“Just kick ’em up the rump a little” That was how President Richard Nixon advised Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns to persuade the rest of the Fed board to cut interest rates in 1971 Kicked or not the central bankers complied Cuts helped Nixon to re-election by boosting employment They also contributed to double-digit inflation that would not be decisively tamed until Paul Volcker ran the Fed in the 1980s Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn December 14th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 05 percentage points; the European Central Bank ecb and the Bank of England were expected to follow suit shortly after The Economist weekly edition was published Technocrats have spent the decades since Burns making Nixon-like meddling more difficult An academic cottage industry is devoted to numerating and ranking central bankers’ independence In 2020 there were more than 150 central banks classed as independent by the Bank of England countsome 90 more than in the 1970s The ecb autonomy is guaranteed by treaty When President Donald Trump criticised Jerome Powell the present Fed chair for raising rates in 2018 the president appeared both backward and impotent This year President Joe Biden has emphasised his support for the Fed Some British politicians in the governing Conservative Party even argue that the Bank of England has not raised rates enoughThe notion that today central bankers might be bullied into stopping the fight against inflation is therefore harder to sustain Yet it would be a mistake to suggest that monetary policy is completely insulated from politics For there are forces threatening central bankers’ independence in new and insidious ways The first is that central banks are less hard-nosed and keener to play to the gallery than they were In the Volcker era economists speculated that independent central bankers might work best if they were more hawkish than society about inflation Over time they came to reject “inflation nutters” in favour of “flexible” inflation targeting which took employment into account too By 2020 central bankers looked jobs-nuts The Fed said it would not raise rates at all until the labour market was tight an approach which left it hopelessly adrift as inflation took off Its top brass had been on a “Fed listens” tour at which the public having not been seriously troubled by inflation for decades told central bankers that stimulating employment should be their priority Advocates for making central bankers directly accountable forget that politicians’ desire to distort monetary policy comes from listening to what voters want Central bankers need independence from the public as much as they do from their elected representatives But they spend ever more time in press conferences and giving speeches At the moment Mr Powell and his peers use their public profile to speak hard truths about how long-term price stability is the foundation of prosperity But their resolve is yet to be tested by a recession which could provoke a backlash like the one Volcker had to see off Only after such a backlash will it be clear whether central bankers see their job as to lead or to listenThe second threat stems from the new tool central bankers have deployed since the global financial crisis of 2007-09: quantitative easing or the purchase of government bonds with newly created money Over the past decade central bankers have become an important force in bond markets as they have attempted to keep long-term interest rates low They have also intermittently solved financial crises by becoming “market-makers of last resort” buying bonds to restore calma job that has become more important owing to the rise of financial intermediaries outside the traditional banking system Central-bank balance-sheets have grown much faster during crises than they have shrunk during tightening episodes At today pace of quantitative tightening qt for example it would take ten years for the Bank of England balance-sheet to return to its size before the financial crisis As central bankers’ footprints in markets grow in size they find themselves making more decisions that are ultimately political in nature The ecb balance-sheet has become the conduit for a de facto mutualisation of some of Italy debts The central bank has not yet started qt but it has unveiled another bond-market “tool” to backstop indebted countries The Fed faced allegations that its support for corporate-debt markets during the covid-19 pandemic favoured bigger firms over smaller ones dependent on bank lending A large proportion of the rise in Britain debt-service costs this year has flowed via the Bank of England which must pay interest on the reserves it has issued to conduct qe Mission creep has put a target on central bankers’ backs Some would like central banks to do even more by deploying their balance-sheets in pursuit of a broad array of goals including subsidising the fight against climate changeTake it to the graveThe final threat stems from government spending Economists’ models say that the ability of central banks to control inflation depends on sound public finances which Eric Leeper of the University of Virginia has called the profession “dirty little secret” Should governments borrow without restraint they undermine the credibility of monetary policy without so much as a phone call to the technocrats who set interest rates All it takes to produce self-fulfilling expectations of inflation is a belief that the government will one day choose to inflate away some of its debts Central bankers should thus look nervously at the increasing tendency of governments to borrow and spend for example on vast energy subsidies as in Europe They should also fear the intense pressure on budgets that is forecast for the coming decades as ageing populations push up spending on health care and pensions Politicians today are very different from

 Dec 13th 2022,The game is up for Sam Bankman-Fried,Only a month has elapsed since Sam Bankman-Fried the founder of ftx a crypto exchange placed the firm along with Alameda Research its sister hedge fund into bankruptcy proceedings The exchange was unable to meet customers’ withdrawal requests; the problem it became clear was that some $8bn of customer assets had ended up in the custody of Alameda and were missing In the intervening days Mr Bankman-Fried has given countless interviews in which he has apologised appeared confused by the unravelling of his empire pleaded ignorance and generally tried to shift the blameListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHe told “Good Morning America” that he “failed to have proper oversight” In an interview with New York magazine he said: “I fucked up I did In multiple ways frankly” He explained to the New York Times that there were mysterious discrepancies between what “the audited financials were the true financials what the exchange understood” and said to the Wall Street Journal that he could not account for the missing money: “I wasn’t running Alameda”Mr Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas on December 12th at the request of the American government The next day he was denied bail; he is expected to be extradited shortly The indictment charges Mr Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts including wire fraud against customers lenders and investors as well as conspiracies to commit money-laundering and commodities and securities fraud For good measure he is accused of defrauding the United States by violating campaign-finance laws The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission two regulators have also filed complaints Some of the facts in the filings are familiar to those who have been listening to Mr Bankman-Fried missives He has admitted he told customers to route their funds to Alameda bank accounthe suggested this was because ftx had not set up accounts and that the funds were lost because of sloppy accounting The sec complaint argues Alameda used the funds to make investments buy lavish properties and offer political donations and that this use of them means Mr Bankman-Fried was “orchestrating a massive years-long fraud”Mr Bankman-Fried has said he was unaware of what the hedge fund did with the cash The complaint alleges he was in fact well aware and that he set up ways for Alameda to borrow customers’ funds On multiple occasions the sec writes he “directed ftx to increase the amount by which Alameda could maintain a negative balance” giving it an unofficial credit line to take customer funds The sec complaint also alleges that Mr Bankman-Fried made Alameda exempt from the processes by which customers’ trading positions were liquidated when markets moved against themIn May as crypto markets crashed despite having “already taken billions of dollars of ftx customer assets” when Alameda could not meet loan obligations the sec alleges that Mr Bankman-Fried “directed ftx to divert billions more in customer assets to Alameda” Most galling perhaps is the allegation that “even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and ftx could not make customers whole” Mr Bankman-Fried continued to make venture investments and took out personal “loans” from Alameda for himself and other ftx higher-ups The sum of these actions the sec argues is that there was no real distinction between Alameda and ftx and that Mr Bankman-Fried used the hedge fund as his “personal piggy bank” without disclosing this to investors or customers In a congressional hearing on December 13th John Ray III appointed boss of ftx by Mr Bankman-Fried before the firm filed for bankruptcy summarised it in a similar manner: “This is really old-fashioned embezzlement This is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose”Mr Bankman-Fried denies any illegal activity and has sought in interviews to distance himself from criminal wrongdoing If he were successfully convicted the former ftx boss might spend the rest of his life behind bars When Bernard Madoff a notorious financier who ran a Ponzi scheme was sentenced in 2009 the judge noted that: “The fraud loss known to date which is greater than $13bn is more than 32 times the baseline level of loss that would carry a sentence of life under the us Sentencing Guidelines” The judge recommended that Madoff should serve 150 years The authorities put the cost of Mr Bankman-Fried alleged fraud at $8bnMr Bankman-Fried seems in denial about the situation He could not attend the congressional hearing as he was in custody but his intended testimony leaked In it he claims he was manipulated into filing for bankruptcy by his general counsel that the team in charge are mismanaging the process and that Alameda and ftx troubles only really began when the boss of a rival exchange tweeted he would sell ftx tokens Mr Bankman-Fried insists the firms could have raised capital and made customers whole When he put this to Ryne Miller his general counsel Mr Miller replied with an answer clear seemingly to everyone but Mr Bankman-Fried “There nothing to save Sam” To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology sign up to the Bottom Line our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 13th 2022,America inflation fever may be breaking at last,“We will stay the course until the job is done” said Jerome Powell the Federal Reserve chairman on December 14th shortly after the central bank latest interest-rate rise As a statement of intent his words were both straightforward and utterly sensible But what it means for the job to be done is becoming a matter of controversy Inflation remains uncomfortably high Meanwhile the aggressive monetary tightening of the past year is only now filtering through to the economy complicating assessments of whether the Fed has in fact done enough to rein in prices Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPromisingly after a difficult two years inflation does appear to be easing its grip on the American economy Overall prices increased by a mere 01% month-on-month in November according to data published on December 13th making for that rarest of recent occurrences: a downside surprise Most encouraging was a breakdown showing that core inflation which strips out volatile food and energy costs had decelerated for a second consecutive month see chartInvestors and analysts scarred by America relentless run of inflation have learned to restrain their hopes after a single month of rosy data Year-on-year rates of inflation remain elevated at 71% for headline inflation But the disinflation in November follows a similarly cheerful batch of data for October Optimism is on the rise albeit still mostly of the cautious rather than the unbridled kind Since mid-October the s&p 500 index of leading American firms has recovered some of the ground it lost earlier this year Concerns are shifting to the prospect of weaker growth Many economists forecast a recession early next year For the Fed these countervailing forces create a tricky balance On the one hand it has just administered the sharpest tightening of monetary policy in four decades lifting interest rates from a floor of 0% in March to more than 4% today With inflation ebbing it is prudent to slow the pace of rate increases On the other hand a perception of Fed softening risks adding fuel to the market rally That in turn would cause financial conditions to ease thereby placing upward pressure on inflationThe Fed has tried to resolve this conundrum by maintaining its hawkish tone at the same time as tweaking its policies On December 14th the Fed raised rates by half a percentage point ending a string of jumbo three-quarter-point increases Most Fed officials believe that they will raise rates to more than 5% next year and refrain from cutting rates until 2024 according to the central bank latest projections “Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely easing” said Mr PowellStrikingly many investors think the Fed will end up being more dovish Bond pricing suggests that rates will peak at less than 5% and that the central bank will start cutting them before the end of 2023Ultimately the decision will come down to the data Prices of consumer goods have started falling as pandemic-era shortages melt away Housing prices are also trending lower The big lingering concern is whether a tight labour market will push incomes and by extension prices higher Investors are betting that wage increases will slow as the economy weakens The Fed understandably is not popping the champagne just yet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 11th 2022,How the West fell out of love with economic growth,This year has been a good one for the West The alliance has surprised observers with its united front against Russian aggression As authoritarian China suffers one of its weakest periods of growth since Chairman Mao the American economy roars along A wave of populism across rich countries which began in 2016 with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump looks as if it may have crested Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet away from the world attention rich democracies face a profound slow-burning problem: weak economic growth In the year before covid-19 advanced economies’ gdp grew by less than 2% High-frequency measures suggest that rich-world productivity the ultimate source of improved living standards is at best stagnant and may be declining Official forecasts suggest that by 2027 per-person gdp growth in the median rich country will be less than 15% a year Some places such as Canada and Switzerland will see numbers closer to zero Perhaps rich countries are destined for weak growth Many have fast-ageing populations Once labour markets are opened to women and university education democratised important sources of growth are exhausted Much low-hanging technological fruit such as proper sanitation cars and the internet has been plucked This growth problem is surmountable however Policymakers could make it easier to trade across borders giving globalisation a boost They could reform planning to make it possible to build reducing outrageous housing costs They could welcome migrants to replace retiring workers All these reforms would raise the growth rate Unfortunately economic growth has fallen out of fashion According to our analysis of data from the Manifesto Project which collects information on the manifestos of political parties over decades those in the oecd a group of mostly rich countries are about half as focused on growth as they were in the 1980s see chart 1 Modern politicians are less likely to extol the benefits of free markets than their predecessors for instance They are more likely to express anti-growth sentiments such as positive mentions of government control over the economy When they do talk about growth politicians tend to do so in an unsophisticated manner In 1994 a reference by Gordon Brown Britain shadow chancellor to “post neo-classical endogenous growth theory” was mocked but it at least indicated serious engagement with the issue Politicians such as Lyndon Johnson Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan offered policies based on a coherent theory of the relationship between the individual and the state gdp small coterie of modern champions such as Mr Trump and Liz Truss offer little more than reheated ReaganismApathy towards growth is not merely rhetorical Britain hints at a wider loss of zeal In the 1970s the average budget contained tax reforms worth 2% of gdp By the late 2010s policies made half as much impact A paper published in 2020 by the late Alberto Alesina an economist at Harvard University and colleagues at the imf and Georgetown University measured the significance of structural reforms such as changes to regulations over time In the 1980s and 1990s politicians in advanced economies implemented a large number making their economies sleeker By the 2010s however they had lost their oomph: reforms practically ground to a halt Our analysis of data from the World Bank suggests that progress has slowed still further in recent years and may even have reversed see chart 2 The American government introduced 12000 new regulations in 2021 a rise on recent years From 2010 to 2020 rich countries’ tariff restrictions on imports doubled Britain voted for and implemented Brexit Other countries have turned against immigration In 2007 almost 6m people on net migrated to advanced economies In 2019 the number was down to just 4mGovernments have also become less friendly to new construction whether of housing or infrastructure A paper by Knut Are Aastveit Bruno Albuquerque and André Anundsen three economists finds American housing “supply elasticities” the extent to which construction responds to higher demandhave fallen since the housing boom of the 2000s This is likely to reflect tougher land-use policies and more powerful nimbys Housing construction across the rich world is about two-thirds its level in that decade see chart 3 Politicians prefer splurging the proceeds of what growth exists Governments are spending a lot more on welfare such as pensions and in particular health care In 1979 the bottom fifth of American earners received means-tested transfers worth less than a third of their pre-tax income according to the Congressional Budget Office By 2018 the figure was more than two-thirds According to a report in 2019 health spending per person in the oecd will grow at an average annual rate of 3% and reach 10% of gdp by 2030 up from 9% in 2018 Politics is increasingly an arms race with promises of more money for health care and social protection “Thirty or 40 years ago it was taken for granted that the elderly were not good candidates for organ transplantation dialysis or advanced surgical procedures” writes Daniel Callahan an ethicist “That has changed” Greater wealth has enabled this Yet politicians rarely ask whether an extra dollar on health care is the best use of cash Britons in their 90s receive health and social care that costs the country about £15000 $17000 a year about half Britain gdp per person Must budgets rise year after year to meet growing demand even as the price of providing that care is also likely to increase? If yes where is the limit? People may see spending on health care and pensions as self-evidently good But it comes with downsides More people work in an area where productivity gains and therefore improvements in overall living standards are hard to induce Perfectly fit older people drop out of work to receive a pension Funding this requires higher taxes or cuts elsewhere Since the early 1980s government spending across the oecd on research and development as a share of gdp has fallen by about a third Much of the extra spending comes at times of crisis Politicians are increasingly concerned with preventing bad things from happening to people or compensating them when they do The enormous system of credit guarantees eviction moratoriums and debt forgiveness introduced during the pandemic brought bankruptcies and defaults to a halt This was radical but also the thin end of the wedge In America for instance the federal government has assumed huge contingent liabilities It guarantees an ever-larger quantity of people bank deposits; it forgives student loans; it offers a wide variety of implicit and explicit backstops to everything from airports to highways We have previously estimated that Uncle Sam is on the hook for liabilities worth more than six times America gdp This year European governments have fallen over themselves to offer financial support to households and firms during the continent energy crisis Even Germany normally Europe most disciplined spender has allocated funding worth 7% of gdp for this purposeNo one cheers when a company goes bankrupt or someone falls into poverty But the bail-out state makes economies less adaptable ultimately constraining growth by preventing resources shifting from unproductive to productive uses Already there is evidence that fiscal help doled out during the pandemic has created more “zombie” firmsthose which are going concerns but which create little economic value The huge implicit liabilities of governments also mean higher spending in times of trouble which reinforces the trend towards higher taxation Why has the West turned away from growth? One possible answer relates to ageing populations People who are not working or are near the end of their working lives tend to be less interested in getting richer They will support things which directly benefit them such as health-care spending but oppose those that produce benefits only after they have gone such as immigration or house-building Their turnout at elections tends to be high so their views carry weight Yet Western populations have been ageing for decades including during the reformist 1980s and 1990s Therefore the change in the environment in which policy is made may play a role Before social media and 24-hour rolling news it was easier to implement difficult reforms The losers from a policya business exposed to greater competition from abroad sayoften had little choice but to suffer in silence In 1936 Franklin Roosevelt speaking about opponents to his New Deal felt comfortable enough to “welcome” his opponents’ hatred Now the aggrieved have more ways to complain As a result policymakers have greater incentive to limit the number of people who lose out resulting in what Ben Ansell of Oxford University calls “countrywide decision by committee” High levels of debt have also constrained policymakers’ room for manoeuvre Across the g7 group of rich powerful countries private debt has risen by the equivalent of 30 percentage points of gdp since 2000 Even small declines in cash flows could make servicing the debt harder This means politicians quickly intervene when anything goes wrong Their focus is keeping the show on the roadavoiding a repeat of the global financial crisis of 2007-09rather than accepting pain today as the price of a brighter future Quite what would push the West in a new direction is unclear There is no sign of a shift just yet beyond the misguided attempts of Mr Trump and Ms Truss Would another financial crisis do the job? Will a change have to wait until the baby-boomers are no longer around? Whatever the answer until growth speeds up Western policymakers must hope their enemies continue to blunder For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 8th 2022,Tackling sexual harassment could bring sizeable economic dividends,Five years after the MeToo movement gripped the world the problem of sexual harassment continues to dog the economics profession Fresh allegations of misconduct at universities in America and Europe are causing a torrent of older cases to emerge Rooting out harassment in academia is particularly hard because career progression depends on the goodwill of not just senior colleagues but also peers at far-flung institutions who often partner with juniors to conduct research and who review papers vying to get published in prestigious journals Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet half a decade has not gone by in vain Many economists are now using the same rigorous approach they bring to assessing the labour market or the impact of workplace accidents to gauge the effects of harassment Their findings help give a sense of the costto victims and the wider workforceof sexual coercion demeaning treatment and degrading comments Fortunately the research also shows that some remedies do work making the pay-off to halting misconduct both sizeable and attainable The greatest cost of harassment is borne by the victims themselves On top of the grave psychological costs there are economic ones too Victims tend to give up their jobs to look for new ones for which they may be less suited Johanna Rickne of Stockholm University and Olle Folke of Uppsala University conducted a survey on sexual harassment and followed respondents for five years They found that women who reported harassment were 25% likelier to leave their job than other women; the equivalent increase for male victims was 15% The women who left also tended to earn less Another study by Abi Adams-Prassl of Oxford University and colleagues using Finnish data on violent incidents including sexual assault shows that female victims have almost as much chance of being durably unemployed as workers laid off after the closure of a plant; for male victims the likelihood is a little lower The fear of being unemployed also appears to deter victims of sexual harassment from speaking up Gordon Dahl of the University of California San Diego and Matthew Knepper of the University of Georgia find that only the more egregious cases tend to be reported during recessionsGender-based harassment also acts as a tax on the rest of the population One way to pin an economic value on this is to estimate how much of a pay cut workers are ready to accept to avoid the risk of harassment In their paper Ms Rickne and Mr Folke ran experiments with hypothetical job offers in Sweden They find that on average the gender most at riskmost often womenis willing to give up 17% of their salaries to avoid harassment In another study Joni Hersch of Vanderbilt University calculates that the collective sacrifice in earnings of American women per filed case of sexual harassment in any given year is $93m Encouragingly research can also guide thinking on how to tackle sexual harassment One lesson is that improving outside options can help Mr Dahl and Mr Knepper find that before North Carolina cut unemployment benefits in 2013 workers were more likely to report harassment Amenities that make it easier to find work such as transport links to thriving job basins should also make a difference Where the potential for retaliation is high and outside options are limited such as in film-making or academia field-wide institutions must be strong enough to punish deviations The American Economic Association has written codes of conduct and can open investigations but lacks the teeth to obtain evidence and impose sanctions Another lesson is that employers themselves should have a strong interest in tackling sexual harassment Caroline Coly of Bocconi University and co-authors find that since 2017 women have been leaving organisations where they fear being harassed in higher numbers The Finnish study also finds that women other than the victim tend to leave a firm where male violence towards women has been reported The corollary is that firms that clamp down on harassers should be able to access a wider pool of talent thereby allowing them to outperform competitorsEvidence of such a bonus is starting to emerge Research suggests firms run by female executives may have become more valuable since MeToo began One reason could be that they tackle male wrongdoers differently Ms Adams-Prassl and colleagues find that female leaders tend to sack perpetrators That in turn prompts more women to stay A paper by Mark Egan of Harvard Business School and colleagues also shows that female bosses are less tolerant of other types of misconduct by men such as consumer disputes or regulatory offencesPaying the priceSuch incentives however can go only so far The final lesson is that organisations under whose roofs harassment occurs often bear too little of the true cost America federal laws cap the sexual-harassment damages a victim can receive from large firms at $300000 Applying the same method used in workplace-safety cases Ms Hersch argues yields a larger amount: $93m the earnings sacrifice women are willing to make to avoid harassment Such payments could deter firms from tolerating misconduct But they may not be enough to change norms and corporate culture For that to happen people in power need to speak outEconomists now need to turn their focus to their own backyard Anna a former economics phd student at a European university whose name we have changed recounts how her supervisor made inappropriate comments and eventually asked her to spend the night at his placewhich she declinedbefore turning vindictive when she requested a change of supervisor After her PhD Anna chose to pursue a career outside academia Not for a lack of ambition she says but to avoid the toxic culture and the unsafe environment it breeds Economics would do well to make sure future Annas decide to stay Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation Dec 1stWeather is again determining economic outcomes Nov 24thOnly a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 8th 2022,Europe and America put a brave face on a growing economic rift,A useful contrarian indicator for gauging the substance of international talks is whether negotiators talk about concrete The more they do the less they tend to achieve The Trade and Technology Council TTC a forum for the EU and America to co-ordinate regulation appears to prove this admittedly cynical rule At its latest meeting on December 5th the White House said it had advanced “concrete action” on transatlantic co-operation by launching new “concrete initiatives” while a joint statement with the Europeans promised yet more “concrete outcomes” and “concrete actions” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe trouble is despite all the talk of concreteness America and Europe now have major disagreements in the economic realm and few obvious solutions The main point of contention is the Inflation Reduction Act the centrepiece of the Democrats’ climate-and-industrial strategy The IRA signed into law in August features nearly $400bn in funding for energy-related projects much of which is contingent on goods being produced in or near America There are subsidies for automakers who buy locally made batteries tax credits for domestic producers of renewable fuels and tax breaks for consumers who buy electric vehicles that contain enough North American componentsThe Biden administration believes these incentives are needed to spur the development of America green economy In industries such as electric vehicles America is a laggard see chart The worry in Europe and Asia is that America giant market and generous handouts will attract their companies at the expense of their home bases In the past year alone international carmakers from BMW and Toyota to Mercedes and Stellantis have announced big investments in America The fallout from Russia invasion of Ukraine adds to the aggravation: a shift away from Russian energy supplies has raised costs in Europe further harming its industriesEurope displeasure was made clear on the eve of the meetings in Washington DC Emmanuel Macron France president called America subsidies a “killer for our industry” in an interview with CBS “60 Minutes” show Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission the bloc executive arm spoke of distortions caused by the American law A single TTC meeting was never going to heal the rift The forum packed into one day talks on risk management in artificial intelligence standards for plastics recycling warning systems for semiconductor supply-chain disruptions and more And yet Valdis Dombrovskis the European commissioner for trade said he left the TTC feeling “slightly more optimistic” about co-operation with America That optimism follows on from President Joe Biden pledge that America could tweak its subsidies to satisfy European companiesWarm words aside what can America do to help? Its climate tax credits enshrined as law cannot be easily modified There is no chance of new legislation during the next two years of divided Congress Instead the response is likely to come from Europe where officials are mulling their own green incentives The most concrete outcome of the TTC may thus be the continued drift of America and Europe towards a full-fledged subsidy race For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

 Dec 7th 2022,Inflation is fallingbut not enough,Before the pandemic the idea of an annual rate of inflation of 10% in the euro zone would have seemed like a horror story In November it was good news Inflation had been 106% the month before A similar surprise came from America As inflation falls so does the expected pace of interest-rate increases On December 14th and 15th the Federal Reserve European Central Bank and Bank of England will each probably raise rates by half a percentage pointa deceleration from the three-quarter-point rises that have recently prevailed Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGlobally inflation has begun to decline primarily because energy prices have eased since the summer and because supply chains long gummed up by the pandemic are operating more smoothly Yet inflation remains a very long way from central banks’ 2% targets There are three reasons to think rate-setters will struggle to hit their goals soonThe first is a continued scarcity of workers While the news on prices has been good the latest wage data are worrying In America average hourly earnings had shown encouraging signs of softening since August But updated figures released on December 2nd upended the picture showing annualised growth of 51% over the past three months roughly in line with other surveys Since the data came out stockmarkets in America have fallen in expectation of prolonged interest-rate rises In Britain wages are growing at a similar rate; a wave of strikes may prompt still bigger increases The euro zone labour markets though not as sizzling are hot enough to make policymakers worry that energy inflation could affect the rest of the economy as workers bargain for higher wages to offset rising living costs The second problem is fiscal policy It would help central banks to cool labour markets if governments shrank their budget deficits Yet America recent Inflation Reduction Act makes only a minimal dent in government borrowing and the Biden administration is trying to forgive swathes of student debt Europe is splurging on energy subsidies despite warnings from the IMF and others that it is unwise to stimulate economies which lack spare productive capacitya mistake America made in 2021 when President Joe Biden “American Rescue Plan” overheated the economy If the EU retains its measures throughout 2023 the cost net of taxes raised to fund the handouts will reach nearly 2% of GDP see chart In aggregate Britain much advertised belt-tightening will not begin until 2025 thanks to its costly energy-price cap Nearly two-thirds of the EU energy spending is on controlling prices for everyone which is expensive and discourages energy saving Only a fifth comes in the form of targeted redistribution to the needy the approach recommended by the likes of the IMF Even Germany which has capped prices only up to 80% of a household previous usage is still borrowing to fund the scheme meaning that it will deliver an economic stimulus The final danger is that energy inflation returns in 2023 This year Europe economies have benefited from weak competition for scarce supplies of global liquefied natural gas LNG in part because China economy has been hampered by its zero-covid policy But China has begun to loosen its pandemic controls If its economy reopens and rebounds LNG prices could surge in 2023 Central bankers’ battle with inflation has reached an inflection point But it will not be won for a long time For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Dec 5th 2022,Can you afford to retire?,Can you afford to retire? The answer is much more likely to be no today than it was a year agoespecially for those old enough to ask themselves the question The resurgence of inflation is eroding the real value of savings Higher interest rates have caused a repricing of bonds and stocks The result is that the pot of assets many future pensioners are hoping to live off has shrunk fast Pundits have long predicted that as populations age and the number of workers for every dependent falls those retirement savings would come under pressurea problem they have dubbed the “pension time-bomb” The fuse now looks much shorter Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe soon-to-be retired are often advised to shift their assets into bonds and out of stocks as they prepare to stop working to protect their savings from big stockmarket corrections So-called “life-cycle” pension funds are usually invested almost entirely in stocks during their owners’ younger years a strategy meant to capture the higher returns that listed equities tend to generate over long periods As workers near retirement these funds usually swap most of their equities for government bonds which are supposed to hold their value But with less than a month to go 2022 looks set to be an appalling year for bonds The typical portfolio of those closest to hanging up their boots has lost 17% of its value since January A year ago a 65-year-old who had saved a healthy $25m for their retirement and invested 80% of it in government bonds and 20% in stocks globally would have typically drawn an income of $100000 If inflation stayed modest they would have been able to draw a similar real income for the next 30 years The asset-price crash however means that the value of the pot has fallen to around $21mallowing them to draw nominal annual payments of just $83000 Soaring inflation meanwhile has eaten up another 10% of that income leaving them with just $75000 in real terms And the shrinkage is hardly over Should inflation remain above 2% for a whilesay it averages 3% a year insteadthen a retiree who made it to 90 might well be living on just 65% of the real income they might have expected until recentlyThis impoverishment could fast become reality for millions A lot of baby-boomers turned into pension-boomers in 2021 The Federal Reserve Board of St Louis reckons there were 33m more retired people in October 2021 in America than 20 months before More than half of Americans over 55 have left the labour force up from 48% in the third quarter of 2019 according to the Pew Research Centre a think-tank in Washington DC This reverses a decades-long increase in the share of people working past 55 which has slid back to the levels of 2007-09 in just a year A similar pattern is evident across the OECD club of mostly rich countriesSurvey data already suggest some of those who recently retired are considering returning to work Those who do not or cannot probably face leaner years than they had expected But individuals are not the only ones who will bear the burden of the adjustment Some of it will also be shouldered by governments through social-security and national-insurance schemes And part of it will be borne by a creature that is becoming ever rarer: the defined-benefit DB pension plan Many of those considering retirement today spent much of their lives working during the golden age of DB schemes when firms or employers in the public sector such as schools and local governments agreed to pay workers an annuity after they stopped working Of the $40trn held in retirement assets in America today $17trn is held in such schemesA typical DB payout is worth 2% of a worker final salary multiplied by years of service So a teacher employed for say 40 years who retired when her salary was $80000 would be paid $64000 per year for the rest of her life In this way the employer shouldered all the investment risk the individual would otherwise have to face; DB schemes not their members are the ones bearing the mighty losses in asset prices this year Some plans also adjust payouts for inflation Over recent decades ageing populations and rising life expectancies have together pulled down interest rates; bigger savings pools chasing a finite volume of assets meant capital became cheaper It gradually became clear to firms and public-sector agencies just how hard keeping their pension promises was going to be From the 1980s the private sector therefore began to phase out its offerings of such plans: the share of employees enrolled in DB schemes in America dropped from nearly two-fifths at its peak to just a fifth by 2008 Then the strain of the financial crisis prompted many firms to reclassify DB plans as defined-contribution schemes where workers simply contribute a set amount to the pot with no guarantee of what they get back after retirement Public-sector employers have had much less success in reducing their exposure to these overgenerous pension schemes however The result is that around $13trn of America DB assets are managed by state local and federal governments Many of the biggest DB schemes and some of the biggest pension funds in existence today are run by public institutions such as the California Public Employees’ Retirement System CalPERS and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan OTPP and have assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars The portfolios of many schemes are suffering just as many more of their members are getting ready to ask for their moneyThe way to measure how easily a pension plan will meet its liabilities in the future is to look at its “funded ratio” This compares the pot of investments it currently holds against the expected future value of the promises it has made to those paying in The sum has three moving parts: the value of the current investment pot the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payouts and the stream of those expected future payments The third factor is the hardest to figure out because future payouts are based on undetermined final salaries and on how long the recipient and their spouse who is often eligible for payments might live Olivia Mitchell a professor of insurance and risk management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania points out that the income stream a DB pension scheme might owe to someone joining the plan today could stretch more than a century into the future if you include payments made to partners Still it is the other two elementsthe value of the investment pot and the discount ratethat decide whether funded ratios soar or sink The easiest way to run a pension is to match assets with liabilities by buying long-term bonds that pay out when pensioners come knocking If yields on American government bonds are the benchmark say then the pension manager might simply buy lumps of them Should the value of those assets plunge the pension plan would still be able to meet its expected future liabilities: it would only have to hold the bonds to maturity and distribute the yield it was promised when it bought them That strategy only works though if the plan is “fully funded”: that is if the cash it has to begin with is worth 100% of its expected liabilities If it is underfundedperhaps because contributions are not high enough or because it made some poor investments in the pastthen putting all of its assets into the investments that earn the discount rate on its liabilities will set a fund up for bankruptcy down the road Many underfunded pensions have had to take risksby holding equities for examplein a bid to fill their funding gaps A combination of bad investment years such as 2001 or 2008 falling discount rates ageing populations and the political infeasibility of asking employees to contribute more has pushed a lot of DB schemes into the red in recent years In isolation falls in the value of the pot are bad But although higher interest rates hurt asset values they can also be helpful for pension schemes because they reduce the present value of future payouts This year has therefore not been a bad one for all pension plans Indeed corporate pensions in America have done rather well After a bumper 2021 the average corporate pot was fully funded at the end of the year for the first time since 2007 Corporate funds then moved to reduce their investment risk early by swapping many stocks for bondsan asset-allocation shift so huge and rapid that it may have contributed to the end of America stockmarket rally at the start of this year Corporate plans elsewhere have not been so lucky if only because their stockmarkets did not do as well to start with Many British corporate plans for example are still underfunded In recent years that has led them to adopt strategies in a bid to protect themselves against falling interest rates; one called “liability-driven investing” ldi nearly blew them up over the summer To ensure they did not look more underfunded when rates fell many British funds loaded up on derivatives that would pay out when rates dipped but required them to cough up cash when they rose As rates rocketed many funds faced margin calls so big that they threatened to absorb all the cash the funds had to hand Only when the Bank of England intervened did the danger of bankruptcy ebb The big losers of 2022 though are public pensions Whereas over the past 12 months the average funding ratio for a private plan has risen from 97% to around 110% that of public pensions in America which stood at 86% a year ago their highest since the financial crisis has dropped to 69%close to a four-year low There are two main reasons for the slump One is that the discount rates used by public plans rather than being benchmarked to a given asset market are instead set by external committees The trouble is that these committees did not reduce discount rates by as much as interest rates fell over the decade that followed the financial crisis which made it difficult to raise them by much this year as interest rates rose again This means the liabilities those pension funds must face in the future remain nearly as high as before At the same time funds’ investments have performed poorly As yields on bonds fell across the developed world in the 2010s many underfunded plans moved into riskier investments such as leveraged loans private equity venture investing and even cryptocurrencies OTPP held a stake in FTX a crypto exchange once valued at $32bn that went spectacularly bust last month Funding ratios can dip only so far before pension funds get into serious trouble “Once a plan is only 40% funded” grimaces Mike Rosborough a former portfolio manager at CalPERS now at AllianceBernstein a research firm “there is often no going back” It becomes almost impossible at those kinds of levels for the pension plan to pay out the annual liabilities it owes to those who have already retired from the income it makes on its assets It is instead forced to sell those assets off This quickly becomes a self-perpetuating vicious cycle: the more assets it has to sell the smaller the pot and the more underfunded it becomes This can go on until the assets hit zeroat which point the plan becomes “pay as you go”: it uses the contributions of current payers to pay former workers or is bailed out by taxpayers This may never become a problem for CalPERS California is a rich state which has been directing extra funding to its pension plans from its budget surplus for years But it is becoming a scary possibility in American states like Kentucky Illinois Connecticut and New Jersey where public pensions are around just half-fundedEven with all their problems pensioners that depend on underfunded public DB plans are miles better off than those relying on Social Security the American equivalent of National Insurance Transfers are mostly paid using contributions from current workers That first started to look shaky in 2008 when withdrawals exceeded contributions for the first time Payments have since been partly financed from a trust based on past surplus contributions But the excess of withdrawals over contributions means that this trust is projected to run out in 2035 after which the state will have to make up the difference The fate of many db and social-security pensioners alike could ultimately depend on the government willingness to bail them out For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterClarification December 12th 2022: This story has been amended to make clear that some DB schemes are suffering but not all

 Dec 1st 2022,A playbook from the 1980s for dealing with inflation,Across the rich world consumer prices are rising by 10% year on year the highest rate since 1983 That year holds a special place in the history books It was the final year after many in which annual inflation was in double figures Thereafter it moved downwards paving the way for the low inflation of the 1990sListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday central bankers hope to repeat the trick and thus enter monetary policy hall of fame alongside the giants of the 1980s Paul Volcker who led the Federal Reserve from 1979-87 is the biggest giant of all But Gerald Bouey in Canada Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in Italy and Karl Otto Pöhl in Germanywho memorably compared inflation to toothpaste “once it out you can hardly get it back in again”also presided over disinflation in that decade Central bankers hope their job will not be too hard The Fed projections suggest that by 2024 inflation will be close to target at the price of just a small rise in unemployment The current period of high inflation is relatively short so the hope is that expectations of price pressure are not entrenched Others say that price rises are in large part driven by supply-side disruptions which should soon fade Yet over time the inflationary surge appears to be broadening almost everywhere In many places expectations are starting to look stubbornly high So the experience of the 1980s may become instructive And once you dig into the history the decade holds three tough lessons for today policymakers First inflation can take a long time to come down Second defeating inflation requires the participation not just of central bankers but other policymakers too And third it will come with huge trade-offs The question is whether today policymakers can navigate these challenges Take the path of disinflation first In the 1980s it was a slog Italy saw success faster than most Under Ciampi the central bank moved from the treasury plaything to a quasi-independent institution: inflation fell from 22% in 1980 to 4% by 1986 But that still meant five long years where prices rose by more than 10% Even if the rich world today reduces inflation as fast as Italy did its average inflation rate would not come down to 2% before late 2025In any case most countries had more trouble than Italy In 1980-81 rich-world inflation fell but progress came to a halt in 1982-83 Then in 1987-88 there was another inflationary spike fuelled by energy costs In some countries inflation jumped around In early 1984 with inflation at 35% New Zealand wonks thought they had slain the monster By mid-1985 however it exceeded 16% We estimate that in only 53% of months in the 1980s did inflation in the average rich country decline relative to the previous month Disinflation was happening but often it did not feel that wayThe second lesson of the 1980s is that central bankers can only do so much “Inflation was not conquered in the 1980s by monetary policy alone” argues John Cochrane of Stanford University in a new paper Some say that the liberalising reforms of the 1980s helped in the fight increasing competition and thereby lowering prices imf research has found that labour- and product-market reforms can under certain conditions reduce prices These reforms though probably took some time to kick in Economists can make a stronger case for the role of fiscal policy in the anti-inflation fight In the 1980s policymakers across the world recognised as they had failed to do in the 1970s that loose fiscal policy could add fuel to the inflationary fire They held back on spending even as households’ real incomes declined Mr Cochrane points out that America primary budget deficits ie excluding interest payments were “unremarkable especially given the severe recessions of 1980 and 1981-82” Governments elsewhere were harder-nosed Japan reduced its primary deficit from 32% of gdp in 1980 to a surplus by 1985 Denmark experienced a tough period of austerity Even France kept a firm lid on borrowing A growing number of economists today are urging policymakers to learn these lessons In a new piece Tobias Adrian and Vitor Gaspar of the imf argue that “[f]iscal responsibilitydemonstrates that policymakers are aligned against inflation” They reckon a given fiscal tightening can reduce core inflation by almost as much as a dose of monetary austerity The third lesson of the 1980s is that disinflation is painful The world economy did not benefit from a “soft landing” where inflation falls without provoking recession Average unemployment across the rich world doubled in the five years after 1979 Some parts of the economy cratered Home construction for instance fell by a fifth in 1980-82 Unsurprisingly therefore there was anger A carpenter sent Volcker a plank of wood in the posta symbol that lumber was unneeded since no one was buying houses In Canada car-workers shut down highways Policymakers nonetheless stayed the course showing the public that they were deadly serious about getting inflation under controlIt was acceptable in the 80sDo policymakers today have the stomach for the fight? Coming so soon after the fiscally austere 2010s many are reluctant to tighten the tax-and-spending screws once again Indeed many politicians have gone the other way and now seem uncomfortable with the notion that anyone should lose out from anything ever They are offering hundreds of billions’ dollars-worth of deficit-financed fiscal support that will fuel inflation whether by subsidising energy bills in Europe offering “cost-of-living payments” in Australia and New Zealand or forgiving student debt in America Policymakers are thus ignoring the fundamental lesson of the 1980s Fighting inflation is hard It requires all hands on deck and immense courage over a long period of time It is also unfortunately almost inevitable that some groups lose out if only in the short term As politicians run scared the 2020s risk earning a special place in the history books toofor failing to tame inflation Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Weather is again determining economic outcomes Nov 24thOnly a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thInterest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

During the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000 it took American venture-capital managers nearly half a year to report impairments after public markets peaked American buy-out funds held off even longer after listed equities crashed in 2007 In fact public markets began recovering in 2009quickly enough that private investors never had to mark down the full extent of the slump It is unlikely private firms will be able to levitate long enough this time Over a year has passed since the peak of the Nasdaq Composite a tech-heavy index The cash holdings of some private firms are eroding leaving little for return-smoothing financial engineers to play with In August Masayoshi Son the boss of Softbank Group a Japanese investment giant predicted private valuations would rejoin public-market ones within 12 to 18 months Without a 2009-style recovery in public equities in sight an unavoidable downgrade looms No doubt many investors would prefer to continue playing along with the peekaboo charade But soon private-fund managers will have nowhere to hide Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:How crypto goes to zero Nov 24thThe tenacity of ESG investing Nov 17thAre tech stocks now good value?

 Dec 1st 2022,Dubious green funds are rampant in America,It is not easy being green In November Amundi Europe largest investment manager downgraded most of its €45bn $47bn of funds ranked Article 9 the highest grade in the EU sustainability disclosures to Article 8 or “light green” New regulations are forcing many others to recast their wares in less virtuous colours Nearly one-tenth of all Article 9 funds have left the category since the European Commission tightened its criteria in July Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat has exposed European fund managers to accusations of greenwashing and for some the label is deserved But new research published this week in the Review of Finance an academic journal suggests American firms are doing worse When it comes to sustainable investing Wall Street stalwarts appear to run a fully fledged laundromat of exaggerated sales pitches and bogus claimsTo gauge this the authors examined funds that have signed up to the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment PRI a scheme that investment managers can sign up to certify they take account of environmental social and governance ESG principles when making investment decisions On the face of it that is a promisingly large sample: 2000 investors overseeing $135trn of assets now say they will obey the PRI The problem is that such pledges can mean little Looking at the period from 2003 to 2017 researchers found no sign that the portfolios of PRI signatories in America had higher ESG scores across a range of metrics than non-signatories Their peers across the pond scored much higher “There could be a couple of bad apples in Europe But it not the entire cart that rotten” points out Alex Edmans a finance professor at London Business School and the editor of the study American fund managers might argue in their defence that they are trying to help dirty companies get greener rather than simply dumping their shares as European funds might do and are being penalised for this But the researchers find little evidence of that Instead they report that American PRI signatories were less likely to engage as shareholders with the companies they owned than their European counterparts Three years after the initial investment ESG scores at those investee firms were found to be no better Higher grades may not be the answer anyway ESG ratings are themselves often flaky and may be a poor proxy for emissionsThe transatlantic divide the paper suggests may stem from a divergence in regulation Europe rules are tedious and sometimes misguided But at least they provide detailed guidance on what counts as sustainable and how green mandates should fit with fund managers’ fiduciary duties By contrast American firms seem to be defining their own rules; some simply sign up to the PRI in the sole hope of attracting green-conscious investors with little to show for their claims Sometimes greenery is even used to keep assets under management growing even as managers post sub-par returns The authors find that poorly performing American funds are more likely to join the PRI than higher-flying peers For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 30th 2022,How the West price cap on Russian oil could roil energy markets,Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in February America energy policy has pursued two grand seemingly contradictory aims The first is to keep global oil supply high enough that prices remain tolerable and public support for sanctions stays strong The second is to asphyxiate Vladimir Putin war machine by stemming the flow of dollars Russia earns by flogging oil barrels Together they form a circle that is hard to square because with supply closely tracking demand amid a dearth of new production taking any oil off the market mechanically triggers higher prices The West has nevertheless tried to defy the law of physics by crafting a growing array of measures to meddle in oil marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe ones that have been deployed until now have often been piecemeal and involve uncomfortable compromises Puncturing its own sanctions against Venezuela thuggish regime on November 26th America granted permission for Chevron a big American oil firm to crank up its production there America has also released huge volumes from its strategic crude-oil stocks; the reserve is now at its lowest level since 1984 The White House least productive effort has aimed to cajole Gulf states into pumping more Within months of President Joe Biden fist-bumping Muhammad Bin Salman the de facto Saudi ruler in Riyadh in July the petrostate and its allies in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC declared they would cut output instead On December 4th the cartel meets again It looks unlikely to help by increasing output now Yet the West most carefully constructed campaign to outsmart Mr Putin has yet to come into action In June the EU announced that come December 5th it would ban imports of Russian seaborne crude oil which accounted for 2m barrels per day b/d or about 40% of Russia total crude exports a year ago Then it said it would also bar European providers of maritime services tankers and insurance from helping non-EU buyers get hold of the Russian barrels it shunsa powerful tool given those firms dominate the global shipping market It soon dawned on America that together those two measures had the potential to squeeze global oil supply And so it insisted on introducing a weakening clause: provided they agree to pay a maximum price set by the G7 for Russia oil non-Western buyers could continue to buy European insuranceAs we went to press the level of this “price cap” was still being debated among Europeans Some led by Poland and the Baltic states want the cap to be low so as to hurt Russia finances Others worried about their shipping industries or retaliation from Russia want to keep it close to market levels Rumours filtering out from the talks suggest it may end up near $60 a barrela discount of nearly 30% to the current price of Brent the global benchmark of $85 a barrelwhich is about what Russia sells its oil for these days anyway Whatever the outcome one thing is certain Never before has such a fiddly set of measures hit the global oil market at once Many of these have been signalled for so long that they may cause few problems But there are reasons to think the boat could be rocked at least for a while In an optimistic scenario the package of sanctions could manage to reconcile the West two contradictory aims The embargo would ensure Europe no longer fuels Mr Putin war: last month the bloc still bought 24m b/d of crude and refined oil from Russia Meanwhile the price cap says an American Treasury official would act as a “release valve” keeping the global market in balance by letting developing countries buy Russian oil at a discount Russia would receive less money whether or not those countries sign up to the plan because the mere existence of a cap or so America reckons would boost their bargaining powerIn the absence of a low enough price cap as is likely to be the case the cost to Russia would be real but modest It would add yet more inconvenience to that created by the West broader arsenal of sanctions which may impair Russia economy in the long run but have hardly proved terminal so far The discounts borne by Russian grades over regional benchmarks have widened in recent weeks but remain well below those seen in the aftermath of the invasion At least the embargo would not roil crude marketsor so commodities markets suggest Brent futures which in June indicated a year-ahead oil price approaching $100 a barrel now place it closer to $85 see chart panel Most traders expect an acceleration of the shift in fuel flows seen so far this year with India and China taking over from Europe as Russia biggest customers This happy story assumes no logistical hiccups will prevent decades-old trading patterns from undergoing a smooth but rapid transition A less rosy scenario however could see sanctions throw spanners in the spigots by introducing unwanted friction Three bottlenecks stand out: a crunch in tankers an insurance gap and a global shortage in risk appetite Start with the tankers Cyprus Greece and Malta loom so large in shipping that Europe ban on the provision of maritime services to countries that do not sign up to the capand many of them loth to endorse American interference in commodity markets have signalled they won’tcould create a big shortage of ships capable of carrying Russian crude Claudio Galimberti of Rystad Energy a data firm anticipates a shortfall of some 70 vessels with an aggregate carrying capacity of 750000 b/d lasting two to three monthsEventually this problem should work itself out Industry insiders point to an ever growing “dark fleet” that is absorbing vessels from established sanction-busters in Iran and Venezuela Russian firms are bringing mothballed vessels back into service; EU shipowners are also transferring assets to operators outside the G7 A top energy trader reckons that by February there will be enough ships to transport Russian crude though vessels to redirect refined products such as diesel from short-haul routes in Europe to distant new customers may stay scarce for some timeThe crunch in insurance coverage is a bigger potential snag It is not that Middle-Eastern or Asian countries keen on Russian barrels do not have local firms with the financial muscle to insure tankers and cargo What they may soon lack is cover for much bigger risks like oil spills liabilities for which can easily reach half a billion dollars Few insurers new to the market will look forward to becoming liable for an ageing Venezuelan vessel going through Danish straits a mere 15m deep says a veteran oil trader without a big backstop The problem is that this sort of backstopreinsurancedemands deep pools of private capital hard to find outside the West Perhaps the Chinese and Indian governments could be persuaded to offer sovereign reinsurance though market insiders doubt they have the stomach In fact some traders reckon Asian buyers could buy less Russian oil rather than more as the insurance ban comes into forceThe third bottleneck could be a lack of appetite outside the g7 for the perceived risks of circumventing a scheme designed by the West Many do not believe American promises to remain hands-off if countries choose to go around the cap It does not help that in its most recent sanction campaigns such as those targeted at Iran America has studiously kept the perimeter and degree of enforcement of penalties vague so as to deter anyone from dealing with its foes The practice known in sanctions parlance as “constructive ambiguity” is hard to roll backAll this could cause a chunk of Russian oil exports to fall off the map prompting prices to jump But a much worse scenario where Russia voluntarily slashes its oil exports and prices get out of control is also possible It may happen if China having to forsake its purchases from other countries to buy yet more Russian oil tries to drive too hard a bargain More likely it would be a unilateral decision by Mr Putin It could incur huge costs: Russia derives 40% of its export revenues from oil sales But that might be worth bearing temporarily if it drives global prices up hurting the West and giving Russia more leverage in negotiations with buyers without inflicting intolerable damage to wells The country decision to shut temporarily nearly 2m b/d of crude production during the pandemic resulted in only a 300000 b/d loss in long-term capacity according to Energy Intelligence an industry publisherUp to now the G7 energy policy has been hashed out in painstaking detail in Washington DC and Brussels But to paraphrase Mike Tyson everyone has a great plan until they get punched in the faceand facing serious setbacks on the battlefield Mr Putin is pulling no punches right now The price-cap first contact with reality could be rough For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 28th 2022,Ending China zero-covid policy could unleash chaos,Not all businesses have struggled through China zero-covid era Andon Health a Shenzhen-listed company that makes covid tests and medical devices for example posted a 32000% increase in net profits in the first three quarters of the year compared with the same period in 2021 as it cranked out testing devices for China and America The 35 largest companies producing covid-19 tests raked in some 150bn yuan $21bn in revenues in the first half of 2022 minting a new generation of pandemic tycoonsBut outside China covid-industrial complex the economy is suffering Lockdowns and onerous restrictions on movement have stunted consumer confidence and economic growth Over the past fortnight they have inspired protests across the country with tensions escalating over the weekend Young people on the streets of Shanghai on November 27th rejected the prospect of endless testing and lockdowns chanting: “We don’t want covid tests; we want freedom”The economic effects of China attempt to rid itself of the virus have never been clearer The movement of people has been severely curtailed During the week of November 14th as covid cases rose the number of domestic flights fell by 45% year on year China three biggest airlines lost a combined 74bn yuan in the first nine months of 2022 Subway traffic in China ten largest cities was down by 32% year on year according to Macquarie an Australian investment bank Box-office revenues a gauge of people willingness to go out and about tumbled by 64% Only 42% of China cinemas were open on November 27th Some of the largest cinemas have closed down altogetherLockdowns are now in place in cities accounting for about a quarter of China gdp surpassing a previous peak of about a fifth in mid-April when Shanghai was shuttered according to an index compiled by Nomura a Japanese investment bank China youth unemployment rate hit a record high in July at 199% A measure of road-freight throughput in the week to November 25th was 33% below its level the year beforeWith covid infections hitting unprecedented highs economic policymakers are attempting to gin up the economy The central bank has announced a cut to lenders’ required reserve ratios Technocrats have attempted to breathe new life and confidence into China property market where sales have plummeted over the past year Easing measures announced in mid-November have sought to help struggling developers gain access to credit so that they can continue building Sentiment is expected to improve a little in time But continued lockdowns and dire consumer confidence will probably stop potential homebuyers making purchases And the prospects for the economy as a whole in 2023 are looking increasingly gloomy Keeping out covid once looked like a good plan As the rest of the world suffered from the seemingly unstoppable spread of new variants in 2021 China appeared to have largely returned to normal life Its covid-related deaths are a tiny fraction of the covid-related deaths suffered in the rest of the world But even as other places learnt to live with the virus in 2022 China covid policy starting with the lockdown of Shanghai the country main business hub has appeared utterly disorganised and repressive Citizens have been subjected to endless testing Businesses and residential areas can be clamped down without warning Travel between cities and provinces has become onerous with each local government enforcing its own version of covid restrictionsRumours of reopening have swirled for weeks sending Chinese stocks on a wild ride The central government issued a list of 20 measures on November 11th meant to relax various covid restrictions such as removing the need for secondary contacts to quarantine and reducing inbound travellers’ quarantine from seven to five days The measures were received by stockmarkets as a sign that China was planning to phase out zero-covid But China leadership did not intend to send such a signal Instead the loosening was just a fine-tuning of the policy aimed probably at making it more bearable for a longer period And even then the relaxations have been implemented in a hodge-podge manner As case numbers have risen in many cities local officials have reverted to broad arbitrary lockdownsWith pressure building on many fronts leaders in Beijing must contend with the notion that they will eventually lose control of both the virus and public patience The path forward is murky Few analysts believe China is preparing for an imminent reopening Instead many see a period of confusion and painful policy blunders immediately ahead For at least the next four months or until after an important political meeting in March leaders in Beijing are expected to uphold zero-covid while also attempting to refine their methods This situation could persist through much of 2023 if central government authorities fail to devise an exit strategyUnder these conditions the outlook for the economy is grim The locking down of businesses residential areas and even entire districts is likely to continue although full-city shutdowns might be avoided Local officials may also do this without formally announcing lockdowns in an attempt to appear to be upholding the new loosening measures This will only add to confusion Many of the current troubles facing airlines and cinema companies will probably continue and spread to other consumer-facing businessesMultinational companies can expect continued disruptions And American consumers shopping for a new phone will also get a taste of zero-covid A recent lockdown of a Chinese plant that assembles iPhones has caused severe disruptions for Apple The factory which employs 200000 people and is owned by Foxconn a Taiwanese company suffered from an outbreak in October that forced a partial lockdown Food became scarce Rubbish piled up By early November many employees made a run for it hopping over walls and walking down motorways in an attempt to get homeTo resolve the labour shortages officials in Henan province where the factory is located have called on low-level Communist Party functionaries to begin staffing production lines while Foxconn tries to recruit more workers Production will probably still fall short There is also potential for an even more disorderly 2023 in which cases run wild and authorities are forced to abandon zero-covid Many China-watchers have been enticed by the prospects of the endwhether planned or forcedof the policy Some have envisioned the country transitioning from its current sclerotic state to business as usual with minimal disruption between the two phases This rosy outlook fails to account for what could become one of the world largest public-health upheavals in recent memory: a vast resurgence in cases across a population almost entirely new to the virusThis period could include a pervasive slowdown in commercial activity Both shopkeepers and shoppers may choose to shelter at home Factories could temporarily stop running as infections sweep across production floors Policy confusion and inconsistencies between counties cities and provinces might snarl supply chains for weeks Some local officials who have been trained over the past three years to avoid covid cases at all costs would probably rely on stealth lockdowns to curtail the spread These conditions if the transmission of the virus is allowed to take place fairly rapidly could last for a quarter at a minimum Ting Lu of Nomura says that the regions covered by lockdowns during this phase could account for as much as 40% of GDP with output falling over one or two quarters Even if China were to end zero-covid immediately the positive economic effects would probably not be felt until 2024 say analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy The interim period would be one of turbulence and instability Growth would be lowand depending on how local authorities carry out covid restrictions protests may very well continue

 Nov 24th 2022,Why American unemployment needs to rise,An unemployment problem as normally understood occurs when lots of people cannot find work Northfield a city in Minnesota with a population of 20000 exemplifies the troubles that arise at the opposite end of the spectrum: when unemployment is so low that lots of businesses and organisations cannot find workers Along with Utah Minnesota has the lowest unemployment rate of any state in America at 21% And in Minnesota Northfield has just about the lowest unemployment rate of any city a mere 12%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf an authoritarian regime were to report such a figure it would elicit groans of disbelief In Northfield the groans are of inconvenience Police officers teachers and factory workers are all in short supply The local hospital needs nursing assistants and surgical technicians The city main retirement home has empty units but not enough employees resulting in a long waiting list Unable to hire enough servers a popular restaurant closed this summer and a favourite café has slashed its hours The local newspaper meanwhile just lost its one sports reporter who took a better-paid job as a forklift operatorMinnesota and this corner of it in particular might sound like an outlier They are in fact extreme cases of a dynamic now common throughout America Nationally there are nearly two job vacancies for every unemployed person just shy of a record high hit a few months earlier In Minnesota the ratio is an eye-popping 35 vacancies per unemployed person also just shy of a recent record and higher than any other state Minnesota ultra-tight labour market sheds light on three questions for the country as a whole How did things get so overstretched? What are the consequences of this degree of tightness? And will balance ever be restored?Employers big and small in Northfield which is a picturesque settlement straddling a river agree that the covid-19 pandemic was the dividing line With about 700 employees Post Consumer Brands a cereal maker is one of the biggest manufacturers in town Before the pandemic struck it regularly had a vacancy rate of 1% or less Now the rate is more like 5% At Minnesota Soulstice a clothing boutique the owner has been so short-staffed that at one point she had to personally work 18 straight days Even when positions are filled candidate numbers are way down When the city advertised for a police job in 2017 it received 55 applications In September it advertised for three positions and received 15 applicationsJust as elsewhere in America there is a litany of explanations for the shortfall of workers Older residents left the labour force in 2020 preferring early retirement to the dangers and hassle of work at the height of the pandemic Cancellation of school meant many parents most often women had to look after children With two liberal-arts colleges in town Northfield usually has lots of part-time student workers But many are now less keen on off-campus jobs Personal savings have soared over the past few years owing to a combination of stimulus cheques and reduced spending on things like concerts and travel This has given some students a useful financial bufferSandwiched between Minnesota biggest citiesMinneapolis and Rochester are an hour drive in either directionNorthfield can tap into a big labour pool But the pool is smaller than it was In the early 2010s the state received more than 15000 immigrants a year Over the past five years inflows have slowed to a trickle under the weight of pandemic border closures and Donald Trump anti-immigration stance Minnesota was also one of the states that lost residents to other parts of the country during covid About 13500 left between April 2020 and July 2021 many lured by opportunities in warmer climes “It used to be that workers were out there and we just had to figure out how to recruit them into manufacturing” says Bob Kill president of Enterprise Minnesota a consultancy “The difference this time is that the bodies don’t exist to fill the jobs”For those job hunting the going is good Not only is employment plentiful but wages are increasing Private-sector pay in Minnesota main metropolitan cluster which includes Northfield rose 57% year-on-year in September in nominal terms ranking third in the country Firms have also become more attentive Mr Kill says that the old manufacturing schedule of eight hours a day five days a week is all but gone Companies now let workers opt for four ten-hour days At the Post factory bosses recently encouraged a worker on the cusp of retirement to stay for two days a weekan arrangement rarely seen in the past “We got to retain a very highly skilled person doing a job that we need fulfilled” says Henry Albers a managerEmployers have also succeeded in eking out slightly more output from their limited resources This can be seen in Minnesota statewide data Overall its labour force is 3% smaller compared with the eve of the pandemic but its gdp is nearly 2% bigger At the Post factory the production lines churning out such delights as Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles have long been automated with workers monitoring computer screens and fixing robots rather than doing heavy lifting But there is always scope for more Mr Albers hopes to use high-tech tools to cut training times for new employees In schools meanwhile changes in licensing requirements have made it a little easier to recruit people without full qualifications Northfield has its high-school kitchen manager leading the consumer-science course “We would have never done that five years ago” says Matt Hillmann superintendent of Northfield public schoolsAt the state level officials are also thinking about how to attract more workers The Democrats swept Minnesota elections earlier this month holding onto its governorship and state house and adding the state senate This places them in a position to consider more ambitious legislation One idea is to introduce publicly paid leave for illness and caring for family memberssomething no state in the Midwest offers “This could be a differentiator saying: ‘Hey if you work in Minnesota we’ll take care of you’” reckons Steve Grove head of the state economic-development department The Democrats have also vowed to fund the construction of more affordable housing a necessity for younger workers Indeed one reason Northfield unemployment rate is lower than nearby areas is that at an average price of about $350000 its homes are expensive for a town of its size making it hard to live there without a jobMinnesota labour market may be able to find balance in a few ways Techno-optimists think a rise in automation will help firms get by with fewer workers Some managers themselves are sceptical noting that many processes are already automated “You can’t automate thinking” quips one manufacturing veteran Northfield Hospital and Clinics the leading health-care provider for the area has adopted a handful of labour-saving technologies from automated screening at entrances to greater use of telemedicine “These are all Johnny Appleseed techniques” says Steve Underdahl president of Northfield Hospital and Clinics In other words it will take time to reap benefitsExpanding the pool of workers would help Perhaps Minnesota will succeed in enticing more Americans to its friendly if occasionally frigid embrace Along with plenty of job vacancies Northfield boasts an appealing motto Who doesn’t like “Cows colleges and contentment”? If Minnesota is successful however it would export some of its labour headache to other parts of the country More arrivals from abroad would be a much bigger help but it is hard to imagine the floodgates opening given the toxic national politics around immigration And Minnesota like much of America faces a demographic crunch “It a math problem We know that baby boomers are continuing to leave the workforce” says Mr Hillmann the school superintendent Five of the city 25 police officers are set to retire in the next two yearsThat leaves another less pleasant solution: an economic slowdown that brings some slack back to the labour market The Federal Reserve has jacked up interest rates Virtually all economists think that slower growth is inevitable next year though they debate whether it will amount to a recession One critical variable is the extent to which companies are able to reduce their demand for new workers without firing existing onesAs the tightest corner of the ultra-taut American labour market Minnesota bears watching Its unemployment rate has started to tick up rising from 18% in June to 21% last month It might seem perverse to call that good news but one lesson from the past year is that excessively low unemployment really does hurt: it constrains and corrodes the services offered by hospitals schools restaurants and more In Northfield there is at least one tiny hint that relief might be at hand After a difficult dry spell the HideAway a downtown café received four job applications over the past two weeks From those it hired two sorely needed baristas “We just got lucky” reckons Joan Spaulding its owner Or was it a new trend?

 Nov 24th 2022,Western officials need banks’ help to keep money flowing to Russia,When western firms fled Russia after its invasion of Ukraine banks and insurers joined the exodus They feared prosecution in the criminal courts for sanctions violations and in the court of public opinion for filling Vladimir Putin war chest The West economic shock-and-awe campaign has largely isolated Russia from the international financial systemListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut recently Western officials have emphasised they want to see money flowing into parts of Russia economy and financial firms to enable this On November 14th America Britain and the eu issued a statement making clear that sanctions target Russia war machine not its food or fertiliser industries Diplomats have reiterated the message in the days since seeking to ensure sanctions do not work too wellWestern governments have a needle to thread They want to starve Russia of war funds and prove their anti-Putin chops but also to minimise collateral damage “When you’re ramping up sanctions ambiguity is your best friend It is your biggest enemy when trying tocalibrate them to the needs of the global economy” says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn a law firm The renewal of a grain deal between Russia and Ukraine which allows food out of Ukrainian ports explains the recent push To get Moscow to sign officials sought to show they were not blocking Russia food and fertiliser exports which comprise 14% and 18% of global volumes America does not want “to impede the ability of developing countries” to buy these goods says a State Department officialThe problem is that politicians and campaigners have not got the message In September members of Congress excoriated the bosses of JPMorgan Chase and Citibank two American banks for doing business with Russian oil and gas firms despite guidance from the Treasury permitting it As Juan Zarate the architect of America sanctions after the September 11th attacks notes: “Corporate concerns regarding transparency accountability and integrity have increased exponentially” esg requirements only add to the burdenEven before esg financiers were supremely reputation-conscious They are also aware politics can shift In 2016 John Kerry then secretary of state criss-crossed Europe to prod banks to do business in Iran after America had lifted sanctions Bankers spooked by Republican opposition balked at the roadshow This was wise: Donald Trump later reimposed sanctionsSo far Western efforts to keep cash flowing into Russian agriculture and parts of its energy sector appear to be working reasonably well Officials have provided guidelines laying out exemptions They also have been in touch with compliance teams about which industries remain fair game and have written “comfort letters” when required Russian wheat exports are now almost back to normal levels and global food prices are at a nine-month lowBut fertiliser costs remain high meaning more reassurance will probably be needed in the future Rebeca Grynspan of the un trade arm has warned that bankers’ fears of “reputation risks” are still causing elevated export costs On November 21st the Netherlands finally released 20000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser that had been stuck in Rotterdam owing to sanctions-related confusion It is an oddity of modern sanctions regimes that officials must spend time helping money flow into their enemy economy For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis
 Nov 24th 2022,Weather is again determining economic outcomes,“Now the rains had really come” writes Chinua Achebe in “Things Fall Apart” a novel set in 19th-century Nigeria “so heavy and persistent that even the village rainmaker no longer claimed to be able to intervene He could not stop the rain now just as he would not attempt to start it in the heart of the dry season without serious danger to his own health” In agrarian economies of the sort depicted in Achebe novel the economic cycle and weather move in tandem When the rains arrive at the right time the harvest is bountiful and prosperity follows In contrast drought brings the risk of starvation and death The rainmakermuch like the modern-day central bankermay attempt to smooth out the business cycle literally dampening things down when they get too hot Ultimately though it is the power of nature that decides the outcomeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEurope energy crisis has brought the return of weather-based economics The crisis is a reminder that for all their technological sophistication even rich-world economies must rely on the munificence of nature European economists financiers and policymakers are watching forecasts closely: a balmy winter will bring relief requiring less gas to be burned in order to keep houses warm If temperatures are not too punishing energy prices will fall and growth be given a boost A frosty winter on the other hand will bring misery: pushing millions into poverty increasing inflationary pressures and keeping industries shutteredFossil fuels originally promised to free economies from the vagaries of the seasons Instead of relying on ambient solar powercaptured in grain preserved in livestock or photosynthesised into biomass and then consumed as firewoodhumanity could burn coal releasing the prehistoric solar power contained within The use of fossil fuels allowed energy to be stored transported and released exactly when required They placed the power of the sun at the beck and call of mankind rather than the other way around Ann Kussmaul an economic historian tracked the spread of the Industrial Revolution through England by assessing when regions moved beyond seasonal economics Parish marriage certificates measured the point at which fossil fuels freed workers from the rhythms of nature and instead tied them to the factory whistle Before industrialisation marriages in low-lying areas would often be in winter after the harvest was taken; in hilly areas they would be during summer once the lambing season had come to an end After industrialisation such regional and seasonal marriage patterns disappeared providing a clue as to which parts of England first adopted fossil-fuel-based production techniquesHundred of years later seasonality is returning to Britain and other parts of Europe as the continent weans itself from Russian gas Part of the reason for this return is physical Natural gas is much harder to transport and store than coal or liquid oil In the past Europe benefited from abundant piped gas provided by Russia as well as the option of top-ups of liquefied natural gas shipped from abroad Now supplies are tight and Europeans must mostly rely on the shipped stuff The continent storage facilities are already more than 90% full and filling the last bits of available space is expensive since the contents must be kept under high pressure Constrained supply means that changes in demand determine the price of energyand the weather is the most uncertain determinant of demandAutumn spared Europe the worst: the continent enjoyed the hottest October on record As a result the price for a unit of gas on the Dutch title transfer facility which provides the benchmark for the continent fell to around €100 per megawatt hour half the rate in September But now winter is starting to make itself felt Germany first snows have arrived Historically there has been a relatively linear relationship between gas demand and the temperature: the colder it gets the more gas is needed This year things are a little more complicated Home-heating systems have been left dormant for longer than usual Blanket sales are on the rise People are willing to wrap up warm to resist Vladimir Putin The gas crisis is not the only reason for a greater focus on the weather Renewables now supply much more energy to Europe than even a few years ago leading to problems if the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine Indeed hydropower has also been an issue for Europe this year after a hot summer dried out the reservoirs and rivers on which dams depend Improving and investing in ways to store electricity whether batteries hydrogen or other techniques could in future smooth out such variability The continent nonetheless faces years or even decades of nervously watching the skies as it adjustsYet in the absence of a transition to green forms of energy the weather would begin to play an even bigger role in economics A warmer planet is already leading to more frequent and extreme events such as Europe summer heatwaves or the devastating floods endured by Pakistan These events amount to so-called real shocks to an economy: external changes that lower productive capacity and so cause both higher inflation and unemploymentHead in the cloudsThis dual threat is harder for central bankers to deal with than downturns that arise from changes in business confidence or a financial crisis Tighten policy too much in response and it will exacerbate the downturn; too little and inflation may get out of hand According to analysis by the imf of Pacific and Caribbean islands natural-disaster-prone countries grow by around one percentage point less a year and have considerably higher debt stocks than those less at risk Climate change will only exacerbate these differences Thus a return to weather-dependent economics will leave some central bankers looking even more like rainmakers: attempting to perform the old rituals or demanding more sacrifices without much capacity to affect the economic weather Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Only a revived economy can save China property industry Nov 17thInterest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

 Nov 23rd 2022,How crypto goes to zero,If everyone stopped using it That in five words is how crypto would go to zero Still the journey is more interesting than the destination The death of ftx an exchange declared bankrupt on November 11th after a spectacular blow-up will encourage some people to turn their attention elsewhere What would have to happen for everyone to give up?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAn answer requires a sense of how the industry works At crypto base are blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum which record transactions verified by computers a process incentivised by the issuance of new tokens The Ethereum blockchain validates lines of code which has made it possible for people to issue their own tokens or build applications These include stablecoins which are pegged to real-world currencies and tokens like Uniswap which manage decentralised-finance DeFi protocols Major chains and a handful of Ethereum-based tokens like stablecoins account for about 90% of cryptocurrency value Big businesses have been built on top of this world including exchanges investment funds and lending platforms To take out crypto entirely would require killing the underlying blockchain layers They could either give way first kicking the stool out from underneath everything else Or the industry could unravel from the top down layer by layer like a knitted scarf Knocking the stool out is extraordinarily hard and the current high value of bitcoin and ether makes it even harder To attack a blockchain and shut it down requires gaining 51% control of the computational power or value of tokens staked to verify transactions The more valuable the tokens the more energy it takes to attack a proof-of-work chain like Bitcoin and the more money to attack a proof-of-stake chain like Ethereum The security of these chainsas measured by the amount someone would have to spend to attack themis now in the region of $10bn to $15bn It would require either a government or an extraordinarily rich individual to mount such an attack And even if Elon Musk was so inclined he seems a little busy at presentUnravelling is therefore the more conceivable path The events of this year have revealed just how prone to this sort of thing crypto is The implosion that seems to have set the chaos in motion was that of Terra-Luna a decentralised stablecoin system worth around $40bn at its peak It collapsed in May wiping $200bn off the market capitalisation of crypto That led a few weeks later to the demise of several lending platforms and a hedge fund events which wiped another $200bn off the market cap The margin calls these platforms faced appear to have imperilled Alameda the trading firm owned by Sam Bankman-Fried and prompted the decision to use ftx customer funds to plug the gap When ftx failed it wiped another $200bn off crypto market cap Now other exchanges and lending platforms look to be in troubleBeady-eyed readers will note that most of this stuff apart from Terra-Luna is in the “on top of” category and not actually on-chain tech DeFi exchanges and lending protocols have continued to whirr even as the enterprises more akin to normal businesses have imploded one by one But the collapse of these enterprises could imperil the underlying tech by taking out chunks of its value making the chains more exposed to would-be attackers and pushing miners or stakers to switch off their machines The value of on-chain activity and tokens is self-reinforcing The more people that use DeFi the more valuable Ethereum becomes The higher the price of ether the higher the hurdle to attack the blockchain and the more confidence people will have that blockchains will endure This also works in reverse The more people shy away from crypto out of fear the less secure it becomes The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is currently $820bn That is 70% below the peak a year ago but still high compared with most of crypto history It is higher than at the start of last year for instance and any point before then including the peak of the bull market in 2017 Many more layerssuch as a major stablecoin big businesses or perhaps other on-chain protocolswould have to unravel to take crypto value back to the levels at which it traded just three or four years ago Crypto reputation has been undermined before It has collapsed in value repeatedly throughout its lifetime Although fewer people will use crypto as a result of the ftx collapse it is very hard to imagine the number will be small enough to take its value to zero For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 22nd 2022,Xi Jinping big bang for Chinese stockmarkets,In a parallel universe CloudWalk might have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in Hong Kong or New York The firm is one of the world leading facial-recognition outfits: its technology can recognise people in milliseconds with astonishing accuracy But modern geopolitics pushed it in another direction America has imposed sanctions on the firm for alleged human-rights violations owing to reputed links with China military So instead of listing on the nasdaq in New York CloudWalk chose Shanghai star Market a bourse set up in 2019 to attract China rising tech companies The company share price is up by a fifth since its debut in MayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCloudWalk listing is one of hundreds that have put Shanghai star and Shenzhen ChiNext another tech-focused market at the heart of global initial public offerings ipos this year Firms have raised $63bn on Chinese exchanges compared with just $21bn in New York and $6bn in Hong Kong The vast majority of proceeds has been raised by semiconductor makers artificial-intelligence and business-software startups robotics firms and other companies developing high-end technology A flurry of smaller telecommunications firms have flocked to the Beijing Stock Exchange which launched last year under the guidance of Xi Jinping China leader At first glance this suggests Mr Xi plan to match a burgeoning tech industry with effervescent capital marketspart of a grander effort to make China a leader in next-generation technologiesis proceeding to perfection Look a little deeper however and the picture is murkier State capital or “guidance capital” in Communist Party parlance is flooding into stockmarkets Our analysis of the 38 largest ipos in Chinese markets in the first three quarters this year which together account for 242bn yuan $34bn or about 50% of cash raised finds that state entities put up 22% of funding A review of a similar sample of ipos last year shows state capital providing a smaller 14% The CloudWalk deal is typical State investors including the Shanghai city government an arms manufacturer and local-government funds stumped up more than 500m yuan for just under a third of the company shares Although China capital markets are increasingly directed by the Communist Party the boom has other causes too Some observers see merely a surge in innovative firms meeting demand from fluid capital markets Nicolas Aguzin chief executive of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has called the flurry of tech ipos a “big bang of finance” State media in China also highlight tensions with America Several Chinese tech firms in addition to CloudWalk have been sanctioned This year markets in New York have all but closed to Chinese companies even if there are some signs the situation is starting to improveMeanwhile China regulatory regime has become more friendly Not long ago onerous reviews were required for new listings This led to a backlog sometimes stretching to thousands of firms and prevented private-equity investors from exiting investments A new system trialled in the star and ChiNext exchanges is currently being rolled out to others It is more in line with international standards setting requirements for listings but dropping the arduous inspections Liquidity and stability have also improved Over the past five years reforms have encouraged the professionalisation of investment Volatile retail trading has been reduced All this fits with Mr Xi publicly outlined vision for Chinese finance in which markets are freer from meddling operating more like ones in America Yet the rush of state money can hardly be ignored Although some of the cash comes from insurers and pension funds most comes from government-backed funds tasked with investing across public and private markets often with a remit to support certain industries such as semiconductor or industrial-robot makers As Ngor Luong of the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology a think-tank notes this money signals to other investors which firms are worthy of funding meaning it carries additional weight The use of state money to direct private investment is an approach that has spread from private to public markets Between 2015 and 2021 government-backed private-equity outfits raised more than 7trn yuan A company that takes state cash in its early stages becomes more attractive to private investors later on since it indicates the firm fits with the official vision of innovation These companies often benefit from other government help including tax breaks cheaper rents and less red tape In the same way securing state-backed investors in an ipo can now make or break deals According to a banker working on Chinese ipos this means policymakers are increasingly successful at directing private capital to the industries they wish to prioritise Companies involved in technologies judged important by policymakers may now receive state capital throughout their life cycle Take Loongson a semiconductor firm in Beijing that designs central processing units Most shares in the company are held by Hu Weiwu its founder But the firm was set up in 2008 with capital from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing city government State funds including a semiconductor backer which has invested 200bn yuan have subsidised Loongson in recent years despite its privately owned status When the firm went public on star this year state investors piled in buying at least 10% of the offeringThis sort of investment is not only about boosting favoured industries Officials have been sending a message about the importance of state capital in the market for some time notes Pan Fenghua of Beijing Normal University Last year regulators began talking of a “disorderly expansion of capital” that supposedly had led to economic imbalances Free-market capital has brought many ailments argued a recent editorial in a state newspaper These include a widening wealth gap environmental problems financial risks and monopolies In a socialist market economy such as China the editorial states capital must be guided by the Communist PartyBecause so many firms have taken state investment investors must now either buy the Party plan or stay out says an investment manager in Shanghai Buying the Party plan may be an unattractive proposition Even before the government began to play a greater role Chinese markets underperformed Aside from a few rapid booms and busts China main stock indices have hardly gained in value over the past decade Some 27% of companies that went public on star between 2019 and 2021 now trade below their ipo price That figure rises to 44% among those that listed more recently as state capital has poured into the market On the Beijing Stock Exchange Mr Xi brainchild it hits a dismal 60%Shanghai and Shenzhen may have become the leading global destination for tech ipos but they have done so with remarkably little global capital Because of concerns about China draconian covid-19 rules and faltering property market foreign investors have been quitting the country in droves According to the Institute of International Finance a trade association a net $76bn of international capital flowed out of the country stockmarkets in October alone Market booms in New York and Hong Kong typically draw smart capital from a wide range of global investors In contrast Mr Xi big bang appears painfully insular He believes the state can fill the role played by foreign financiers It is to say the least a bold experiment For more

 Nov 17th 2022,Big emerging-market companies worry investors,Since september when a botched budget in Britain roiled markets enough to threaten giant pension funds investors have been looking for other vulnerabilities that might cause markets to break Emerging economies are a prime candidate Historically high American interest rates and a soaring dollar have triggered financial instability across the developing world A few unlucky places including Argentina and Sri Lanka have stumbled into crisis this time round but many emerging-market governments have deeper foreign-exchange reserves and less dollar-denominated debt than before and thus look much sturdier than even a decade ago Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBig firms in these countries are a different story Debt issued by large companies has risen relentlessly since the turn of the millenniumfrom just over 60% of emerging-market gdp in 2000 to more than 90% on the eve of the covid-19 pandemicas firms took advantage of low interest rates Borrowing then jumped a further ten percentage points in 2020 alone Much of this money is owed to foreigners Although governments in emerging economies began to borrow in their own currencies after blow-ups in the 1990s corporate debt is still mostly denominated in foreign currencies meaning local-currency depreciation leads to a deterioration in companies’ balance-sheets According to JPMorgan Chase a bank the default rate for emerging-market issuers of high-yield corporate debt has jumped to 114% this year well above the 17% notched in 2019 and the long-term average of 37% Higher rates and an expensive dollar are only partly to blame Troubles have been concentrated in China where property-market woes have kept default rates in the sector at double-digit levels for two consecutive years as well as in Russia and Ukraine Russian firms are expected to default on debt worth $28bn in 2023 equivalent to two-thirds of the remaining stock of debt Nevertheless markets have for the most part already priced in losses reckons JPMorgan so defaults are unlikely to spark a wider crisisIt is problems elsewhere that look more troubling Rising rates and slowing growth have taken a toll on property markets around the world and this is now creating difficulties for firms outside China as well as within A default in late September on short-term debt issued by the developer of Legoland Korea has thrown debt markets in South Korea into turmoil Yields on short-term debt have shot up to the highest levels since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In late October the government said it would buy around $35bn in corporate bonds in order to stabilise markets In recent weeks property troubles have also popped up in other emerging Asian economies Liquidity has evaporated from Vietnamese corporate-bond markets following an effort by officials to rein in corruption in the country property market As prices for developers’ shares and bonds tumble the central bank is weighing intervention to keep the market functioning Indonesian developers face similar difficulties Prices for the bonds of several large firms have fallen to distressed levels amid credit-rating downgrades and fears that default risks are growingThis spreading financial unease may seem reminiscent of past panics including the devastating crisis that ripped across Asian economies in 1997 and 1998 There are though good reasons to hope trouble will be contained Rising rates have hurt property markets but most big firms pay fixed coupons on their bonds and have not issued much new debt over the past year Governments across Asia have fiscal room to support their economies and hefty piles of foreign-exchange reservesYet both Britain budget fiasco and the sudden collapse of ftx a cryptocurrency-trading platform demonstrate how quickly financial vulnerabilities can crystallise into problems A few wobbles among emerging-market bonds could prove a few too many for comfort For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 17th 2022,Only a revived economy can save China property industry,Many elderly Chinese suffer from what they call the “three highs”: those of blood pressure blood sugar and cholesterol According to some economists such as Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences the property market suffers from “three highs” of its own Prices are lofty especially in the peripheries of big cities The debt of property developers is too high because they must hold expensive illiquid assets like land And households sink too much wealth into property because they see it as a lucrative investment rather than a place to liveListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn an aggressive attempt to cure these maladies China policymakers have created several others The flow of finance to property developers has slowed abruptly since the government imposed limits on their borrowing in 2020 forcing dozens into default This has reduced the pace of construction for flats many of which were sold in advance And these delays have in turn contributed to a sharp slowdown in property sales especially among people who now doubt that they will receive any flat they might purchaseOn November 11th China central bank and banking regulator issued a plan to tackle some of these problems They will encourage commercial banks to help finance stalled homebuilding projects alongside state-directed “policy banks” They will temporarily suspend limits on banks’ exposure to real estate and urge them to extend the maturities of loans which are due in the next six months And regulators will guarantee new bonds issued by developers they consider viable including private-sector firms It is not clear this will be enough to solve developers’ woes The measures will do more to increase the flow of finance and pace of construction than to revive sales In the first ten months of this year China property firms sold 941m square metres of residential floor space a quarter less than in the same period last year Boosting this figure would do wonders for these firms’ balance-sheets and their creditors’ chances of repayment But any attempt to revive sales raises hard questions for policymakers If sales now are too slow what pace would be too fast? To solve this year crisis must people be tempted to buy more housing than they need?China president Xi Jinping insists that housing is for living in not speculation To stick to this instruction home-building in China cities ought not to exceed “fundamental” demand which depends on the growth of China urban population and its desire for living space But China property market is sometimes called upon to serve other purposes too During the global financial crisis in 2008 China stimulated construction to employ laid-off manufacturing workers and save the economy Demand for housing then acquired a speculative momentum of its own Between 2011 and 2015 China built roughly 18% more flats than it required to meet fundamental demand according to a paper published last year by Wu Jing and Xu Mandi of Tsinghua University And it did that even after demolishing over 7m old or decrepit homes a yearDemand for living space in China cities will grow more slowly in the years ahead Having torn down so many old buildings in recent years China bulldozers are running out of targets The proportion of urban homes without an independent toilet fell from 32% in 2000 to 15% in 2015 point out Mr Wu and Ms Xu The property market must also contend with an unwelcome bend in the so-called urbanisation curve Ray Northam a geographer noted in 1975 that urban centres are “a complex baffling and not easily understood creation of man” Nonetheless he argued that they grow in a somewhat predictable fashion The fraction of a country population living in cities follows an attenuated s shape rising slowly during an initial stage of growth more quickly during an acceleration stage then slowing and flattening off during a terminal stage Mr Wu and Ms Xu show that the acceleration stage in China ended some time around 2007 Since then the country has been in the upper half of the s Its urbanisation rate reached 65% in 2021 and can be expected to rise by only a little over one percentage point a year for the rest of this decadeWhat does this mean for property sales? The paper by Mr Wu and Ms Xu relies on China census and mini-census which appear at five-year intervals This makes it hard to adjust the numbers to take account of recent events But an alternative model based on annual data was published in 2020 by China Index Academy the country biggest property-research institute It calculated that developers’ sales volumes would need to shrink by about 37% a year in 2021-25 to remain in line with demand a worrying conclusion for firms which desperately need sales to riseFrom S to V?Yet the true picture is not quite as gloomy This year collapse has been so profound that developers are now far behind the schedule laid out by China Index Academy From the start of 2020 to October this year they sold only about 80% of the floor space the model projected for that period That gives the property market some scope to rebound from this crisis before resuming a stately long-term decline The level of sales envisaged by the model for 2023 is well below last year peak but it is also 16% higher than the pace of sales this year In theory therefore China property market has room for a cyclical upturn even in the midst of a longer-term decline meaning policymakers can try to revive sales without stoking speculative demand Yet even such a limited rebound is far from guaranteed Developers may succeed in rolling over debts and completing ongoing projects They may struggle to attract new custom Consumer confidence remains near record lows No one knows how or when China will exit its damaging “zero-covid” policy For as long as economic growth remains precarious households will be wary of the outlays that are required to buy a home In the past a property revival has saved China economy Now only a revived economy can save Chinese property Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Interest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?

 Nov 15th 2022,Even a global recession may not bring down inflation,Investors have swooned at the good news Since early October European shares have risen with optimists declaring an end to the continent energy crisis in sight Chinese stocks have jumped at recent talk that Xi Jinping will abandon his “zero-covid” policy and as regulators have loosened their curbs on the property sector On November 10th on the news that America consumer-price inflation had come in slightly below economists’ expectations the tech-heavy nasdaq index rose by 7% one of the biggest ever daily moves as investors priced in lower interest rates Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut take a step back and the outlook has in fact darkened in recent weeks The global economy is slowing perhaps into a recession as central banks ramp up interest rates to battle a once-in-a-generation surge in prices see chart 1 Even with one month of better-than-expected data for America there is scant evidence that inflation is anywhere near defeated see chart 2 Indeed in much of the world it is broadening out For most of this year people have worried about a downturn In June Google searches for “recession” neared a record high For a long time however the gloomy rhetoric ran ahead of reality Output in the median rich country increased by about 13% from the end of 2021 to the third quarter of this yearnot spectacular but not bad In the year to September the average unemployment rate in the oecd a club of mostly rich countries that accounts for about 60% of global gdp fell by close to one percentage point Joblessness in the euro area hit an all-time low Consumer spending was strong with hotels planes and restaurants packed the world over Now reality has caught up with the rhetoric Higher borrowing costs are starting to bite In many countries including Canada and New Zealand house prices are falling as homebuyers face expensive mortgages Housebuilders are cancelling projects and homeowners are feeling less wealthy Other companies are also reining in spending In their latest monetary-policy report the Bank of England researchers note that costlier finance is “weighing on investment intentions” The minutes of a recent Federal Reserve meeting observe that fixed investment by businesses has “already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions” Deteriorating economic conditions are beginning to show up in “real-time” data Goldman Sachs a bank publishes a “current-activity indicator” a month-by-month measure of economic strength Last month for the first time since the initial covid-19 lockdowns in 2020 rich-world economies appeared to shrink see chart 3 Likewise a global survey of purchasing managers indicates a contraction for the first time since June 2020 Since July a “nowcast” of global annualised gdp growth produced by JPMorgan Chase another bank has fallen by half Optimists point to strong labour markets America formidable jobs machine has slowed but is still whirring adding more than 250000 positions in October Elsewhere though signs of weakness are emerging Claudia Sahm an economist has suggested that a recession is nigh when the average of the unemployment rate over the past three months rises by at least 05 percentage points relative to its low during the previous year We find that eight out of 31 rich countries currently meet this criterion including Denmark and the Netherlands This is not a high proportion compared with say the beginning of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 But it does signal that a serious slowdown is now under way The “Sahm rule” reveals another important truth: that different countries are moving at very different speeds Aside from America a number of places including Australia and Spain are still growing at a decent rate Yet others are in trouble Sweden where high interest rates are hurting a particularly frothy housing market is losing steam fast Britain is now almost certainly in recession In Germany sky-high energy prices are forcing industrial shutdowns It may be faring the worst of all rich countries How severe will the downturn be? Households in rich countries are still sitting on trillions of dollars of “excess savings” which they accumulated in 2020-21 from stimulus cheques and other fiscal support This money will allow them to continue spending even in the face of falling real incomes New research by Goldman Sachs finds that large private-sector saving surpluses are associated with less severe recessions And healthy savings pots mean economic pain is less likely to translate into financial distress Mortgage-delinquency rates are actually declining in America and are extremely low in New Zealand and Canada Marching ordersLabour markets are weakening but a rise in unemployment like that seen after the financial crisis is unlikely This is because demand for labour has a long way to fall before it matches supply Early this year the two were seriously out of whack with the number of unfilled vacancies across the oecd peaking at 30m according to our calculations Now as demand falls vacancies rather than jobs seem once again to be taking the strain We estimate that the number of unfilled positions has fallen by a tenth since the high but the number of filled posts is static Much depends on the path of inflation Central banks are willing to induce a recession in order to lower it Higher rates may bring “some softening of labour-market conditions” as Jerome Powell the chairman of the Fed noted earlier this month “We do think that [raising rates] is going to dampen demand we’re not going to pretend this is pain-free” warns Philip Lane chief economist of the European Central Bank Both economic theory and data over the past seven decades suggest that falling gdp is associated with a large decline in the speed of price rises But the lags between tighter monetary policy and lower inflation are not well understood Central banks may have to cause more pain than they anticipateIn some countries lower energy and food prices are helping to drag down the headline rate of inflation America recent figures for October were better than economists expected In general though prices are not heading in the direction that central bankers would like Inflation “surprises” across the rich world when reported data come in higher than forecast are still common see chart 4 According to figures released on November 16th inflation in Britain was 111% in October well above economists’ expectations On the same day Canadian data showed no sign of waning inflation Almost everywhere “core” inflation which reflects underlying price pressure better is rising In three dimensionsbreadth wages and expectationsrich-world inflation is getting more not less entrenched Begin with breadth When the inflationary surge started last year it was confined in most countries to a small number of goods and services In America it was second-hand cars In Japan it was food In Europe it was energy This provided false comfort to pundits many of whom assumed that once the prices of these few components stopped rising overall inflation would fizzle out In fact the inflation virus has spread We analysed the consumer baskets of 36 mostly rich countries In June 60% of prices in the median basket were rising by more than 4% year on year Now 67% are Even in Japan the land of low inflation the prices of a third of the basket are rising by more than 4% This broadening out is in part due to an exceptionally strong dollar which raises inflation by making imports more expensive But it is more to do with what is happening in domestic economiesThis is where the second dimensionwagescomes in Pay is a guide to the future path of inflation: when companies’ labour costs rise they tend to pass them on to customers in the form of higher prices Inflation optimists point to data from America where there is some evidence of a pay slowdown albeit from increases of 6% or more year on year Growth in Britain also seems to have peaked at a high-but-no-longer-rising rate Elsewhere though there is not much evidence of restraint New research from Pawel Adrjan of Indeed a jobs website and Reamonn Lydon of the Central Bank of Ireland suggests that nominal pay in euro-zone job postings is rising by more than 5% year on year and is still accelerating French wage inflation “has further to go” reckons JPMorgan In Germany ig Metall a big union for metals and engineering workers is seeking a pay rise of up to 8% In New Zealand Norway and Sweden pay growth is still rising This is not what you would expect at a time when the economic outlook is dire The third dimension is expectations Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy runs millions of news articles in several languages through a model to construct a “news inflation pressure index” The index which has proved to be a good predictor of official numbers is still elevated Similar evidence comes from Google-search data which suggests that global interest in inflation has never been so high Survey-based measures of expectations similarly provide no evidence of weakening inflation Figures put together by the Cleveland Fed Morning Consult a data company and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University gauge the public inflation expectations in various rich countries According to the survey for October in the median country the public reckons prices will rise by 5% over the next year as it has in previous months see chart 5 The inflation expectations of companiesthe economic actors that actually set pricesare just as concerning A survey by the Cleveland Fed based on research by Bernardo Candia Olivier Coibion and Yuriy Gorodnichenko three economists finds that American firms currently expect inflation of 7% over the next year the highest level since the survey began in 2018 Painful ignoranceEveryone can agree on one thing about the past year It has demonstrated just how poorly economists understand inflation including both what causes it and what causes it to persist It is likely therefore that economists will also struggle to predict when inflation will cool Optimists hope that prices will once again take people by surprise with their rise slowing sooner than expected But it seems more likely that inflation will prove stubborn even as the economy slows That will leave policymakers with a grim choice: to squeeze the economy tighter and tighter or to let prices spiral For more expert analysis of

 Nov 14th 2022,A radical shift in China property and pandemic policies,For almost three years China policymakers have been fighting a two-front war: against a virulent pandemic and a volatile property market Their chosen policy instruments have turned out to be double-edged “Zero-covid” mass-testing and hair-trigger lockdowns have saved lives at great cost to the economy Tough curbs on property developers have stopped overborrowing but also led to dozens of defaults and a prolonged slowdown in one of the country biggest drivers of growthIn recent days China policymakers have signalled a tactical retreat on both fronts On November 11th officials released 20 measures adjusting zero-covid policies to make them a little less onerous and costly to administer On November 13th China central bank and banking regulator circulated 16 measures to relieve the credit crunch in the property industry restart construction on stalled projects and prevent a fresh wave of defaults Together the measures amount to the biggest shift in Chinese policymaking in years The Hang Seng China Enterprise index of mainland firms listed in Hong Kong is up by 21% so far this month Another index tracking Chinese developers rose by 13% on November 14th alone The covid-19 measures include a reduction in the quarantine time for incoming travellers and an end to the “circuit breaker” which suspends airlines that inadvertently carried infected passengers People at two degrees of separation from a covid-carrier “close contacts of close contacts” will no longer need to quarantine And close contacts must now spend a mere five days rather than seven in a quarantine facility plus another three confined to their homesThe 20 steps are not necessarily a prelude to the abandonment of China zero-covid policythey may just be a refinement of it Indeed with infections rising including in big cities like Guangzhou China may see more lockdowns in the immediate future rather than fewer But the 20 steps still represent the biggest relaxation of the country pandemic stance since covid began to spreadLikewise the 16 measures for the property market represent “the most crucial pivot” in China housing policies since policymakers’ hawkish turn last summer according to Ting Lu of Nomura a bank Back then regulators began rigorously enforcing limits on the amounts developers could borrow and banks could lend Their aim was to kill the property market speculative momentum and cut the sector down to size They succeeded all too well Developers fell into default or distress construction halted on pre-sold projects homebuyers’ confidence collapsed and sales plunged Housing is for living in not for speculation China government insists But unfinished flats are bad for bothJust as last year curbs tightened access to financing these measures loosen it They are intended to increase lending to viable developers and construction firms avert a fresh wave of loan or bond defaults finance the resumption of construction on stalled projects and ease the plight of mortgage-holders Developers’ loans due in the next six months should be extended Bonds should be renegotiated Regulators will also guarantee new bonds issued by viable developers including private-sector firms China state-directed “policy banks” will help finance stalled housing projects and any commercial banks that lend alongside them will receive favourable regulatory treatment Banks will be instructed to be lenient when rescheduling mortgages secured against unfinished flats or owed by individuals thrown into difficulties by covid Success is far from guaranteed The measures envision local governments state-owned asset-management firms and commercial banks working together to restructure distressed developers without providing a template for this financial choreography Nor are the 16 measures the government first attempt to revive the property sector Indeed they include several steps that have already been taken In August it was announced that two policy banks would lend 200bn yuan $28bn to help finish housing projects A similar announcement a month later said that six state-owned banks would lend 600bn yuan in the last three months of this year It was also previously revealed that China regulators will help private firms issue up to 250bn yuan of bondsTogether the measures old and new should help developers meet existing obligations But will it help them sell new properties? When access to finance slams shut sales quickly suffer When it reopens sales do not necessarily revive It will take time for stalled projects to be finished especially if the developer must first be restructured It will also take time for a steady flow of completions to restore confidence And even when buyers feel sure that a flat they buy will be built they may not feel confident enough to actually purchase one given declines in house prices and the weakness of an economy prone to lockdownsInvestors have welcomed the combined 36 steps policymakers are taking to revive growth But much remains uncertain not least how officials will react to widespread covid outbreaks next year It may be that China cannot truly revive home sales until it takes further steps to live with the disease If that is the case the 20 steps on covid may be just as important a signal to the housing market as the 16 steps on property 
 Nov 13th 2022,Markets are suddenly exuberant Are they right to be?,WITH THE inflation crisis well into its second year a few words have cemented their place in the lexicon of investors There were the subsequently much-derided predictions of a “transitory” problem There were also the accurate forecasts of interest-rate “front-loading” by central banks and more recently grumbling about the belatedly “expeditious” manner in which America Federal Reserve has approached tightening Attention now is on the concept of the “head fake”: the notion that a rosy batch of data suggestive of receding inflation can fuel a burst of optimism in markets only for the dreary reality of persistent price pressures to reassert itselfAt the tail end of last week beleaguered asset prices soared buoyed by America latest inflation numbers Stocks rallied around the world The NASDAQ America tech-heavy benchmark climbed by nearly 10% on November 10th and 11th its strongest two-day rally in more than a decade Beaten-down currencies such as the pound and yen also rebounded Economists had expected America consumer price index CPI for the month of October to increase by 06% from a month earlier Instead according to figures released on November 10th it rose by 04% That is a small difference in the grand scheme of things On an annualised basis it equates to inflation of nearly 5% well above the Fed target of roughly 2% But investors were quick to extrapolate to the possibility that maybejust maybeinflation grip on the American economy was weakening Almost instantly traders revised down their estimates for the peak of interest rates Before the release many thought the Fed would lift rates to 55% by the middle of 2023 Now bond yields suggest 5% is more likely That would have all kinds of positive consequences It would reduce the likelihood of a crushing recession in America and beyond ease the pressure on other countries’ central banks to keep pace with the Fed and boost the prices of risky assets especially stocks Hence the question about whether the data amount to a head fake After all investors were burned in autumn last year when inflation briefly appeared to top out and again this July when they concluded prematurely that the Fed was going to reduce the intensity of its tightening On both occasions market rallies fizzled out in short orderIs this time different? The case that price relief is finally at hand rests on two pillars First a wide array of products appear to have moved towards deflation The prices of core goodsexcluding volatile food and energy itemsfell by 04% month on month in October Some of this reflects the unwinding of pandemic-era price surges such as those for used cars But declines were broad: household furnishings clothing and school supplies all got cheaper And retailers report higher inventories and somewhat softer consumer demand The net effect appears to be a long-awaited decline in goods pricesThe second pillar is a tantalising hint that prices for services are also heading in the right direction The single biggest driver of services inflationthe cost of housinglooks like it is losing a little oomph The most important factor in determining housing costs in CPI is rents which accounted for more than half of the increase in core inflation in the past few months In October rents rose by 07% month on month down from 08% in September That is significant because it suggests official estimates are tracking in the same direction as higher frequency private-sector gauges which have shown deceleration in rental inflation for nearly half a year A basic difference in methodology explains the gap: private-sector gauges look at the asking price for properties on the market whereas the official measure looks at rents actually paid by tenants including those on existing often cheaper leases Allowing for that long lag rents may be on the cusp of becoming a force for disinflation in the CPIParadise postponedA reality check is useful however As the experience of the past year shows monthly figures can be noisy And the fundamental problem in America is excessive demand relative to supply This is now most acute in the labour market where extremely high job vacancies underpin hefty wage increases To rein in inflation the labour market needs to cool The economy is well past the point of being able to enjoy disinflation without collateral damage It is theoretically possible companies could pare back their hiring without pushing huge numbers onto the dole Yet some increase in unemployment seems inevitable and for the Fed even desirable What is more the stock rally is unwelcome from the Fed point of view Markets are the primary transmission belt for monetary policy A large increase in stock prices represents a loosening of financial conditions which if sustained would make it easier for companies to obtain credit running counter to the central bank efforts Fed officials are deeply versed in the history of the 1970s when America struggled with double-digit inflation and when central bankers erred by relaxing policy as soon as pressures started to easesomething that allowed inflation to roar backJerome Powell the Fed chairman is determined to avoid a similar mistake At a press conference on November 2nd after the latest rate rise he said no fewer than four times that the Fed still has some “ways to go” That ought to serve as a warning for investors suddenly giddy with optimism Even if the lower-than-expected inflation reading does mark a turning point in America battle against inflation it will be a gradual turn not a sharp reversal

Some stocks including Amazon and Netflix remain expensive on favoured measures Other smaller ones including PayPal and Zoom may attract interest So might two giants Alphabet with a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 looks cheaper than most value stocks Meta which currently trades at just nine times earnings and two times book value might have piqued even Graham interest Tech investors have long been conscious of having paid a lot for their shares but hoped these valuations would be justified in the long-run The fact that many tech stocks now qualify as value stocks will come as a considerable blow Perhaps the idea that value investing and tech stocks are inherently incompatible was simplistic Modern value investing is practised by all sorts including a number of quantitative investors such as Cliff Asness at aqr Capital Management who crunch vast data sets to compare firms against wide and varied measures of their worth Rather than comparing the results with arbitrary criteria across all kinds of firms they instead tend to compare them within industries But one thing remains true regardless of the sophistication of the analysis Tech stocks today are much better value than they were at the start of the yearRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Financiers’ pronouncements on China do not match their actions Nov 3rdThe surprising maturity of the crypto-rave crowd Oct 27thCan Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Nov 10th 2022,Interest rates have risen sharply But is monetary policy truly tight?,For a few months this year there was a rare moment of economic consensus The rich world central banks especially America Federal Reserve had uncaged inflation They had to correct the error by raising interest rates sharply and swiftly Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut as 2022 draws to a close the uneasy peace between doves and hawks has broken down Their latest disagreement about monetary policy is so big it is as if they are working with different sets of facts While some economists warn that interest rates have now risen by more than is necessary to contain price growth others say that monetary policy has not really tightened at all Like fixing a dislocated shoulder sorting an inflation problem is supposed to be painful yet simple Every economist knows the maxim dubbed the “Taylor principle” after John Taylor of Stanford University which tells central bankers to raise interest rates by more than inflation has gone up To disregard the rule is to allow inflation-adjusted borrowing costs to fall administering a stimulus that makes the problem worse To follow the principle policymakers must raise real rates every time prices accelerate If they do sooner or later the economy will slow and order will be restored The Taylor principle is necessary to stabilise inflation in state-of-the-art economic models It is also common senseYet today no major central bank is following the principle Since the start of last year inflation has risen by five percentage points in America eight points in Britain and ten points in the euro zone Central banks’ interest-rate rises are rapid by historical standards But they are nowhere close to keeping pace with this price growth And that has led some economists to ring the alarm bell “The Fed has not yet hit the brakes” declared Jonathan Parker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after the latest bumper 075-percentage-point increase on November 2nd The trouble is that although the Taylor principle makes sense in theory there is disagreement about how to apply it in practice A true measure of real interest rates is forward-looking New borrowers and lenders need to know what inflation will be in the future not what it was in the past According to a survey by the New York Fed consumers expect inflation of 54% over the next year Mr Parker subtracts this from the Fed target interest-rate range of 375-4% to get a negative real interest rate of about -15% That is below the prevailing rate before the covid-19 pandemic and “very very not contractionary” he saysBut why only look forward one year? Many loans are provided over a longer time frame And here lies the doveish calculation Greg Mankiw of Harvard University worries that the Fed may be overdoing things because the five-year real interest rate priced into financial markets has risen sharply since the start of last year by 34 percentage points at the time of writing The textbook version of the Taylor rule a more expansive cousin of the Taylor principle says that real interest rates should go up by half the increase in inflation Look five years ahead in financial markets and take a measure of underlying inflationMr Mankiw points to a three-point rise in annual wage growthand real rates have roughly kept pace with inflation In other words the Fed tightening looks like too much rather than too littleThe argument relies on what economists call “rational expectations” The public view about what a central bank might do tomorrow is in theory just as important as today short-term interest rates As a result in modern economic models it does not matter much if policymakers fail to raise interest rates above inflation at a given point in time notes Michael Woodford of Columbia University Only the expectation of a systematic disregard for the Taylor principle “indefinitely into the future” would cause monetary mayhem And the Fed policymakers are hardly showing this sort of disregard The central bank is not done raising interest rates: markets expect them to rise above 5% next year That could be enough to satisfy the Taylor principle by thenA belief that expectations are rational is usually associated with a conservative hawkish view of the world in which people belong to the species Homo economicus Today these arguments help doves who argue that central banks should calm down The Fed boasts that it has turned the real interest rates that are priced into financial markets positive at almost all horizons The worst case of a yield curve having slipped away from a central bank control is in Britainbut ironically the problem is that markets seem to expect more interest-rate increases than the Bank of England would like At its latest meeting the central bank forecast that the path for rates envisaged by markets would result in a deep recession and bring inflation well below target It is almost as if the Bank of England has too much inflation-fighting credibilityEven if the Taylor principle is being met on a forward-looking basis that is not the end of the story The principle prescribes only the minimum tightening that is needed to bring inflation to heel Were central banks only narrowly to clear the hurdle then inflation could take a long time to return to target Another issue is that interest rates are supposed to rise still higher when an economy is overheating America where there are almost two job openings for every unemployed worker clearly has this problem Failing to respond to it could prolong the inflationary episodeFrom first principlesPerhaps the best argument for more rate rises though is the poor record of both economic models and financial markets at predicting inflation Over the past year both have persistently underestimated its rise In an uncertain environment it makes sense to put more weight on data and less on forecastsa point central bankers have begun to emphasise Following the Taylor principle with respect to realised inflation might make policymakers slow to react to a change in the economic winds But that is a price worth paying to be sure of bringing inflation under control Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How best to bring back manufacturing Nov 3rdHow to escape scientific stagnation Oct 27thWhy inflation refuses to go away Oct 19th

Two stories circulated both a touch Shakespearean The first is one of rivalry and the second of hubris Start with the rivalry between Mr Bankman-Fried and Mr Zhao Mr Bankman-Fried owns three firms: ftx a global exchange; ftxus an American exchange; and Alameda Research a crypto-trading fund In theory these are separate entities But the connection between Alameda and ftx has long been unclear On November 2nd CoinDesk a news website reported that tokens issued by ftx made up two-fifths of Alameda assets and were worth $58bn That sum was almost double the market capitalisation of the tokens and a slice was marked as collateral raising concerns that Alameda had borrowed against them possibly from ftx itself Apparently in response Mr Zhao tweeted he would liquidate Binance holdings of ftx tokens then worth over half a billion dollars That he later moved to snap up the firm led many to believe he had orchestrated the chaoscasting doubt on ftx in order to set off a fire sale It seemed a plausible story There is little love lost between Mr Bankman-Fried and the less-celebrated Mr Zhao The Binance boss has long claimed his firm is headquartered “nowhere” It is banned from providing some services in countries including Britain owing to a lack of information about compliance with regulations Mr Bankman-Fried has reportedly goaded Mr Zhao about this But the apparent size of the hole in ftx balance-sheet indicates problems ran far deeper than a rival starting rumours The details of what went wrong in the beanbag-strewn offices of ftx and Alameda are not yet clear An exchange which sits between buyer and seller and takes a spread should not be an easy business to bankrupt It is not typically exposed to runs since it merely holds assets on behalf of investors Problems can emerge though when such firms make loans allowing customers to buy “on margin” or lend out crypto tokens they hold on behalf of investors in exchange for collateral like cash or other tokens ftx seems to have allowed Alameda to borrow customers’ assets by posting ftx tokens issued by the exchange itself as collateral As ftx tokens fell in value the firm no longer had enough assets to cover the liabilities it owed to customers causing a downward spiral In coming up with its wealth estimates Bloomberg assumes both Alameda and ftx are now worth just $1 Sequoia a venture-capital firm has told investors it has written down its stake in the exchange to zero Reports on November 9th suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission America top financial regulator had months ago launched a probe into ftx handling of funds as well as the connections between Mr Bankman-Fried firms America Justice Department is also reported to be investigating the firm ftx has not yet commented on either storyThe fallout will have wider consequences The crypto winter had previously claimed only the types of victims that would be expected including a poorly designed stablecoin a hedge fund and several platforms that made risky loans That it has come for ftx a well-regarded business and Mr Bankman-Fried is an enormous blow It has left other institutions scrambling to reassure customers Coinbase a large exchange has sent out reassuring missives to the press Its share price has nevertheless shed a fifth of its value in recent days and is close to all-time lows The collapse of ftx may be enough to reverse the embrace of crypto by institutions ordinary folk and the occasional government Institutional investors including Temasek a Singaporean wealth fund; SoftBank a Japanese tech-investing group; and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan a Canadian fund had all dipped their toes into the industry by buying stakes in ftx Legislators will now eye crypto with even deeper suspicion Whatever the precise cause of ftx implosion the story is already a tragedy for the industry For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 9th 2022,Financial markets bet on an end to China “zero-covid” policy,Is China about to abandon its struggle with covid-19? Judging by recent moves in the markets you might think so Rumours that China had assembled a reopening committee inspired a big rally in the country shares the offshore yuan and even the price of copper in the early days of this month A social-media message that helped circulate the idea was subsequently dubbed the “trillion-dollar” tweet Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf nothing else the market movements were a reminder of the costs of China “zero-covid” strategy which requires mass testing and frequent lockdowns to stamp out the disease Few policies are so economically damaging that mere rumours of their repeal can create so much wealth so quickly A reopening could lift the value of China shares by 20% or $26trn according to Goldman Sachs a bank Because China is the only big economy still prone to lockdowns it is the last opportunity for investors to profit from a reopening rally These tend to happen early and fast which is why investors risk jumping the gunOptimists point out China is taking modest steps to become more open Its aviation regulator has more than doubled the international flights planned for the next few months compared with a year ago China may shorten the quarantine for incoming travellers and abandon the “circuit-breaker” which suspends airlines that bring in infected passengers International sports events are returning Shanghai eerily quiet during its lockdown in April and May will hear the growl of racing cars when Formula One returns in April 2023In September China approved an inhalable vaccine that is now being used in 14 cities At a private conference on November 4th a former official at its Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said that “substantive changes” in the country approach were likely in the next six months according to Reuters a news agencyBut if China is preparing to exit preparations will be lengthy It will first want to suppress small but widespread outbreaks in more than 100 cities including Guangzhou the capital of Guangdong a province with a gdp as big as South Korea It will then want to keep a lid on infections through winter so as not to overtax its hospitals And it will presumably take no big decisions until new officials are installed at the National People Congress in MarchBefore it can reopen with any confidence China will need to stockpile antiviral drugs It will also have to build more intensive-care units and crucially lift the vaccination rate among its elderly The vaccination rate is a “leading indicator” of reopening reckons Citigroup another bank The share of people aged 60 or above who have received a booster shot reached 66% earlier this year before plateauing Some wonder if China is waiting for more effective home-grown jabs before renewing its immunisation drive It is also possible that Chinese officials do not want to prod the elderly to get another jab until they know reopening is on the way The protection conferred by even the best shots wanes So there are dangers in vaccinating people too soon as well as too little As it happens the percentage of boosted elderly increased to 685% in November If it continues to climb speculation about a reopening will intensifyThe economy could grow by 55-6% in the event of an orderly reopening according to the Economist Intelligence Unit our sister company Grimmer scenarios are possible: a chaotic end to the “zero-covid” regime could cause the economy to shrink for a quarter before a subsequent recovery For this reason whenever it begins the pace of reopening is likely to be cautiousAlthough many will feel relief as controls are relaxed others will be worried It will take a concerted propaganda effort to dispel the stigma the disease now carries meaning consumer confidence may rise only slowly On November 6th vaccinated competitors took part in the Beijing marathon the first for two years running over 26 miles from Tiananmen Square to the “Bird Nest” Olympic stadium The route to reopening could be just as arduous For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub
 Nov 8th 2022,Economic growth no longer means higher carbon emissions,If anywhere can claim to be the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution it is Coalbrookdale a pretty village in England West Midlands In 1709 Abraham Darby a local merchant leased a foundry and fed the furnace with coking coal rather than charcoal made from wood The use of the fossil fuel meant he could make pig iron much more cheaply and cast it into pots pans and cauldrons for cookingthe kind of low-cost manufactured goods that would over the next three centuries produce an unprecedented rise in living standards across the worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDarby furnace was not just ground zero for the Industrial Revolution It was also ground zero for global warming Since the fateful smelting economic output and greenhouse-gas emissions have risen in tandem England furnaces were joined by coal-powered railways and steam-powered textile mills all using tools cast from coke-fuelled foundries Between the middle of the 19th century and the outbreak of the first world war Britain national income per person more than doubled and its carbon emissions increased four-fold When other countries industrialised their emissions spiralled tooAs politicians gather in Sharm el-Sheikh an Egyptian holiday resort to review progress on climate change at cop27 there is at least one cause for optimism: the historic link between rising prosperity and carbon emissions has been broken Today Britain is a member of a large and growing group of rich and middle-income countries that has severed it This decoupling has been achieved not through the large-scale deployment of renewable energyor indeed by exporting emissions to poorer countriesbut by a change in the relationship between economic growth and energy that is perhaps as significant as those first stirrings of the Industrial Revolution three centuries agoAll told some 33 countries have in recent years cut emissions while maintaining growth Around three-fifths are European meaning as was the case during the Industrial Revolution the old continent is leading the way But the group also includes America where emissions fell by 15% between 2007 and 2019 even as gdp per person rose by 23% as well as others that have joined more recently These include Australia where emissions have fallen by 9% since peaking in 2012 and Israel where they have fallen by 12% in the same period even as both economies have grownIt would be wrong however to characterise decoupling as a luxury reserved for the most affluent countries Thanks to energy-efficiency improvements emissions in eastern Europe have fallen since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the same time as living standards have converged with western Europe Argentina Mexico and Uruguay have also joined the decouplers In Mexico for instance emissions have fallen by 16% since their peak in 2012 Around the world before the covid-19 pandemic distorted the numbers more than 1bn people lived in countries with falling emissions and growing economiesTerritorial emissions which reflect domestic production began to fall much earlier In Britain they peaked in the 1970s before oil shocks and strikes decimated the country industry But their decline merely reflected the fact that more manufacturing was taking place abroad: British clothes were being sewn in Dhaka instead of Derby which led to no reduction in global emissions The figures in this article mostly come from analysis of data produced by the Global Carbon Project a greenhouse-gas-monitoring outfit These include estimates of the emissions from imports and so capture the vast majority of a country carbon footprint In other words Britain figures include emissions from imported t-shirts made in BangladeshThe more recent decline in emissions is therefore the real deal Part of the explanation is that the countries to which manufacturing has been outsourced now emit less carbon themselves notes Viktoras Kulionis of Pictet Asset Management In all but a couple of dozen industrialising countries gdp growth produces fewer carbon emissions than used to be the case a phenomenon which is known as “relative decoupling” In 2008 China exported emissions peaked at around 15bn tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent before falling to 1bn in 2019 owing to improved efficiency and a move from chemicals and metals exports to less carbon-intensive electronics ones Emissions imported by the oecd group of mostly rich countries peaked in 2006 at 2bn tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent They have since fallen by more than a third to 13bnBut the shift mostly reflects a watershed change in how energy is used in the West Decoupling can occur for two reasons: either because output becomes less energy-intensive or because the energy used becomes greener For the past decade or so it has mostly happened because of the former The energy intensity of gdpthe supply needed to produce a dollar of national incomehas fallen faster than gdp has grown This can be seen in America The country is often considered a polluter par excellence In fact its territorial emissions peaked in 2005 Since then the energy intensity of its gdp has fallen by nearly a quarter So even though America gdp has risen by 29% emissions have fallen by 15% Similarly four-fifths of the fall in German emissions since 1990 reflects lower energy intensity Only the remaining fifth comes from the use of greener energyFalling energy intensity is the result of changes to the structure of rich-world economies A visitor to Coalbrookdale in the 18th century compared its smoke heat and fire to a vision of hell Nowadays the old furnace lies cold; the last foundry which made parts for Aga ovens closed in 2017; and the site has become a tourist attraction It is a symbol of Britain shift from an industrial economy to a service-based economya shift which has big implications for emissions As Nick Eyre a climate-policy expert at the University of Oxford notes an extra trip to the theatre requires much less energy than making additional pots and pansThe move from manufacturing to services has happened across the rich world Industry share of American gdp fell from 17% in 2007 to 14% by 2019 In Germany a country known for its manufacturing prowess its share fell by two percentage points in the same period Even in Mexico one of the poorer countries to have decoupled its share dropped from 27% to 25% The task now is to accelerate decoupling One reason for optimism is that so far it has happened without colossal outlays or much political consensus Many of the West high achievers have emissions-trading schemes or other forms of carbon pricing but even laggards have managed to reduce their carbon footprints Increasing use of renewables in electricity generation as well as electrifying the heating of homes and transportwhether through electric cars or encouraging public transporthas the potential to make a big difference But perhaps the greatest reason for optimism is the evidence that poorer countries are industrialising in different ways from their predecessors Data from the Global Carbon Project suggest that Egypt the cop27 host reached peak emissions in 2017 India and Vietnam which are becoming a bigger source of exports as trade shifts away from China are considerably greener than their economic rival In 2007 when China economy was roughly as big as India is today it emitted around twice as much carbon dioxide India and Vietnam are still powered by coal The difference is they are making much more efficient use of it For more

 Nov 6th 2022,Who wins from the unravelling of Sino-American trade?,From disease and downturn to the deterioration in Chinese-American relations there has been no let-up to the blows battering the world trading system The latest threat stems from the possibility of another global recession Only two years after the world sank into a covid-induced slump shipping bosses are again warning of grim prospects for international trade Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven beyond the ups and downs of the economic cycle deeper shifts in global trade are taking place Firms are reconsidering their production decisions and governments are pushing the process along Such shifts might have seemed outlandish in 2018 when Donald Trump then America president first slapped tariffs on imported Chinese goods Since then a pandemic has struck and President Joe Biden has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technology to China and plans to provide subsidies worth hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in domestic manufacturing A rejigging of trade now feels inevitable rather than unimaginableand the outline of its new geography is becoming clearerGlobal trade in goods staged an impressive bounceback after the covid-19 downturn in 2020 As a share of world gdp its value last year rose to the highest level since 2014 But not all trade routes are flourishing When Mr Trump took his protectionist turn there was hope that economies in Africa and Latin America might attract some of the business that would have otherwise flowed to China Instead the biggest winners from changing trade patterns are to be found in AsiaGlobal trade data emerge slowly Figures on imports to big economies are therefore the best way to get an up-to-date picture of what is happening According to American data released on November 3rd the country imports have risen by a third since 2018 Gains though have been unevenly distributed American imports of Chinese goods stand just 6% above four years ago a hefty decline in China market share since President Trump launched his trade war America imports from the eu have also grown in lacklustre fashion up by just 12% since 2018 “Friendshoring” may be happening but not on a grand scale Imports from Canada and Mexico have risen by 39% and 34% respectivelyThe great champions of the past four years are in Asia Exports to America from Bangladesh and Thailand have jumped by more than 80% since 2018; exports from Vietnam are up by more than 170% see chart India and Indonesia have seen their exports grow by more than 60% As a result China share of American imports dropped by four percentage points between 2018 and 2022 from 21% to 17% China used to account for nearly half of Asia exports to America; now it accounts for just over a thirdNor is this simply an American trend China is also importing more from Asia Over the first nine months of this year the share of China imports coming from America fell by two percentage points compared with the same period in 2018 The share coming from the eu declined by a similar amount On the other hand the Association of South-East Asian Nations asean a regional club of ten countries saw its share of China imports grow by two percentage points European trade figures are less up-to-date but Asia rise is also visible in them Although the share of eu imports arriving from China increased last year so did those from South and South-East Asia Neither China nor Europe saw a comparable rise in imports from other regions of the worldCultivating new sources of goods or components takes time and investment so the shift in trade patterns now visible in the data mostly reflects choices firms made well before this year geopolitical ructions Some redistribution of trade would have happened even in placid economic conditions Rising labour costs in China for instance would have made it attractive to move low-value sorts of manufacturingin textiles and apparel sayto places like Bangladesh However Mr Trump tariffs seem to have played an important role According to recent analysis of industry data by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank China share of America imports rose from 36% to 39% this year in goods not covered by tariffs For goods subject to a 75% tariff however China share sank from 24% to 18% And for those hit by a whopping 25% tariff which covers lots of it equipment China share of imports fell from 16% to 10% Overall America is now much less dependent on Chinese goods from furniture to semiconductorsThis change is more nuanced than it appears at first glance It seems likely that many of the components used to make goods in India or Vietnam are themselves produced in China Although the detailed supply-chain data needed to say for sure will not be published for several years Chinese export figures are certainly suggestive The two-percentage-point drop in the share of China total exports destined for America over the period from 2018 to 2022 is exactly matched by the increase in China exports to asean economiesThe story so far seems to be one in which Asia emerging economies increasingly intermediate trade between China and the rich world Dreams that supply chains draped across Latin America and Africa would remake the world economic geography are still nothing more than dreams But this direction of travel is an unalloyed boon for a rapidly growing arc of countries stretching from India to the Philippines In time as the consequences of recent geopolitical developments accumulate an ever larger share of the value in Asian supply chains may concentrate outside of China rather than within it For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,Europe energy crisis is very far from over,IN MID-OCTOBER off the Spanish coast a number of slow-moving metallic domes emerged on the skyline They were tankers pregnant with superchilled liquefied natural gas LNG and awaiting delivery at busy “regasification” terminals where their liquid fuel is turned to gas before being transferred across the continent Iberia has the biggest facilities in Europe but congestion is building elsewhere too The amount of LNG off European shores has hit 12m tonnes according to Kpler a data firm up from 140000 in August At least the crews have beautiful weather in which to relax Across Europe temperatures are unseasonably warm: southern Spain is still seeing days above 30°CListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis combination of plentiful gas and warm weather which reduces demand for the stuff is a nightmare for Vladimir Putin and has led some optimists to declare that an end to Europe energy crisis is in sight For months Russia has sought to sow division in Europe and undermine support for Ukraine: first by demanding payment for gas in roubles; then by slashing flows through Nord Stream its main pipeline to the continent; and then in September by shutting the conduit indefinitely By paying over the odds Europe has nevertheless managed to fill its storage facilities As a result gas prices have sunk to $39 per million British thermal units from $100 in August Meanwhile Brent crude the oil benchmark sits at $95 per barrel below the $139 peak it hit in March Yet to declare an end to the crisis is premature Prices will rise as cold spells hit and other LNG buyers particularly in Asia compete for cargoes Russia faced with military setbacks could crank up the pressure further Mr Putin options include stopping all gas deliveries to Europe or vandalising infrastructure Such measuresor the use of a tactical nuclear weaponwould trigger another wave of sanctions from the West To understand how the energy war might develop The Economist has worked with modellers at Rystad Energy a consultancy Our analysis suggests that complacency is dangerous Things could get very bad very fastWe have simulated three scenarios Even the first under which relations do not deteriorate is far from pleasant It assumes that the Nord Stream pipeline remains shut It also assumes that Europe follows plans to implement an embargo on Russian crude and prohibit local insurance firms which have 90% of the global shipping market from covering vessels carrying Russian oilalbeit with a big exemption Non-Western buyers that agree to pay a capped price for Russia oil set by America and the EU are due to be allowed to purchase European insurance For Europe this scenario triggers a crisis but not a catastrophe Supply cuts mean that by the end of 2022 the continent will have missed out on 84bn cubic metres bcm of Russian gas equivalent to 17% of its normal annual consumption Higher LNG imports have already plugged part of this hole A smaller chunk is filled by greater piped flows from Azerbaijan and Norway and another by painful but voluntary consumption cuts Our simulation suggests thateven if the winter turns frigid boosting demand by 25 bcmEurope storage will allow it to get through the summer of 2023 by which point LNG imports may start to ramp upUnder this scenario governments will not have to ration gas Europe will though have to pay dearly for it As Namit Sharma of McKinsey another consultancy notes high prices have already led to shutdowns in energy-hungry industries such as aluminium and ammonia If Nord Stream remains shut throughout 2023 Europe energy deficit will widen requiring even bigger cuts in consumption Gavekal a research firm estimates that a 1% drop in energy consumption in Germany or Italy reduces GDP by 05-1% It is hard to gauge the cost of this for Russia Its piped exports to Europe already down by four-fifths cannot easily be sold elsewhere Its pipeline to China the only serious alternative is too puny to handle big flows However the price for what it is able to sell would be much higher In theory the EU dual oil embargoes coupled with a price cap are a bigger threat to Russia oil exports the country real moneymaker But we assume as the market does that the cap will be watered down and Russia will find buyers for many barrels it is unable to sell to Europe Western officials are leaning towards a loosely policed cap set at near $60 a barrel Since our base case expects global prices to stay below $90 that would not make much difference to the price of Russian oil which currently trades at a 20-30% discount Spanner in the spigotThis explains why in such a scenario Russia pockets $169bn in oil revenues in 2023 barely less than the $179bn it earned in 2021 It and other market participants still incur increased transaction costs caused by longer tanker journeys smuggling shenanigans and other frictions Europe pays a hefty price Importing Russian seaborne barrels cost it $90bn in 2021 The replacement of these in 2023 would cost $116bnIn our second scenario “escalation” Russia lobs a few grenades It starts by shutting its pipeline through Ukraine one of the two conduits still open in the process depriving Europe of another 10-12 bcm a year The country leaders would claim a pretext such as the “leak” that halted flows through Nord Stream After all Gazprom its gas monopoly still wants to be seen as a supplier that respects contracts at least outside the West says Anne-Sophie Corbeau formerly of BP a British giantThis initial strike would not surprise traders many of whom have already discounted Ukrainian volumes Traders would be stunned however if Russia stopped supplying LNG to Europethe next step in this scenario These deliveries worth 20 bcm a year equivalent to half of Russia annual LNG exports have continued under the radar Russia would not want to lose them altogether if only because that would cause the global spot price to rocket hurting friendlyish countries such as India and Pakistan which struggle to compete with Europe for cargoes Thus we assume Russia would offer the supply to these countries at cut priceIn this scenario the West retaliates by giving its oil price cap more bite perhaps threatening Western infringers with huge penalties toughening checks and lowering the cap To counter the counter Russia persuades opec and its allies some 23 countries that produce 40% of the world crude to cut their monthly production target by 1m barrels per day b/d on top of a 2m b/d cut implemented in October Rystad model projects that at the end of this shoot-out Russia will emerge less bloody This is partly because the tighter cap provides non-Western countries with a greater incentive to build an alternative oil-trading system Giovanni Serio of Vitol a trading firm says G7-owned tankers are already being bought up by non-Western players often in Asia or the Middle East China and India which have sucked up most of Russia excess barrels thus far can probably self-insure their ships Other countries may tap the “black” trade where Russian oilferried on tankers with their transponders turned off transferred from ship to ship on the high seas or blended with other crudescannot be traced Although Russia would take a hit on its gas revenues its oil income would be resilient Our calculations suggest the country oil exports would fall in both 2023 and 2024 by 2m b/d compared with 2021 forcing it to curtail production by more than 15m b/d The tighter market would push Brent into the triple digits and there would only be a small contraction in demand This would allow Russia to make up for the volume shortfall Its oil-export revenues would remain remarkably steady at $170bn in 2023 before falling to $150bn the year after Europe meanwhile would face tens of billions of dollars in extra costs Our third “extreme” scenario assumes that Russia perhaps facing catastrophic losses on the battlefield no longer cares about money or keeping allies sweet and opts for all-out energy war It begins by shutting TurkStream its remaining gas link to Europe The pipeline mostly serves Russia-friendly countries such as Hungary and Turkey But terminating it leaves Europe short of another 15 bcm a year Then Russia decides to wreck Europe gas-import infrastructure This possibility once unthinkable has become rather less so after saboteurs bombed Nord Stream in September Our extreme scenario assumes that Russia manages to stop flows through Norway two largest pipelines robbing Europe of another 55 bcm in yearly supply This would be quite a move The pipelines are far from Russia and Western countries may consider it an attack on NATO Leaving aside potential military ramifications we assume that Western powers would respond with “secondary” sanctions threatening non-Western individuals or firms trading Russian oil with measures such as the loss of access to American dollars This forces banks and insurers everywhere to dump Russian business making embargoes far more effective The Kremlin retaliates by convincing OPEC to declare another 1m b/d cut to its output target It also chokes off exports through the CPC a pipeline that carries 12m b/d of mostly Kazakh oil but which ends at the Russian port of Novorossiysk where the fuel is loaded onto ships America in an attempt to dampen the oil price accelerates releases from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve Yet the reserve is not infinite notes Jason Bordoff an energy tsar under Barack Obama Having been raided for months it is already at its lowest level since 1984 Thus we assume OPEC could wait it out first cutting production and then raising it when the strategic reserve runs dryAt the end of all this extraordinary back-and-forth Russia would enjoy a pyrrhic victory Its oil exports which only the black market can absorb crater to 3m b/d or less for years Despite the huge global supply gap Brent rises to “just” $186 a barrel before falling to $151 in 2024 because oil demand is crushed Russia oil revenues plummet to $90bn or less Europe faces an excruciating squeeze It must fork out $250bn in 2023 and $200bn in 2024 merely to replace Russian barrels Its annual import-gas bill nears $1trn almost double our base-case scenario despite much lower incoming volumes Making up for the lost gas proves impossible Our simulation suggests that Europe storage empty by November 2023 would remain bare for the whole of 2024 Europe unpluggedEuropean solidarity would almost certainly break down worsening the continent misery A recent simulation by Germany economic ministry assessed what would happen if in February next year power utilities in the country south were to receive 50% less gas than normal many French nuclear reactors remained shut as they have been this year and coal plants faltered They concluded that the EU would have to distribute 91 hours of blackouts among its members Germany in panic mode might decide to cut electricity exports to France or stop gas flows to the Czech Republic and Slovakia Britain which has meagre storage facilities but big gas needs would be vulnerable This future-gazing has limitations It only considers the energy war leaving aside what will happen on the battlefield and in the broader economic conflict Huge unknowns from the weather to the durability of Ukraine military could tip the balance And nobody knows what might trigger a transition from one scenario to the next if only because that depends on what happens inside Mr Putin head Yet the simulation holds two clear lessons One is that in the ninth month of the energy stand-off Russia retains more options for escalation than the West It has already shut its main gas supply route to Europe but the bloc needs all it can get so cutting off the rest would still wreck havoc And whatever energy Europe buys from others must still pass through hubs and spokes that Russia at its rashest could try to destroy The other lesson is that embargoes will not drain Russia treasury at least until Europe is prepared to bear much more pain The more Russian fuel cannot get to market the more Europe has to pay to replace itwhile rising prices limit the Kremlin losses It is only when oil prices cannot go higher without destroying demand that Russia truly suffersCorrection November 4th 2022: An earlier version

 Nov 3rd 2022,The growing popularity of a strange form of debt diplomacy,Reality caught up with the Egyptian pound on October 27th Since Russia invaded Ukraine prompting foreign investors to flee risky assets the country central bank has burnt through its foreign reserves in a bid to keep the currency fixed against the dollar But last week officials agreed to float the poundthe first of several concessions to secure a $3bn loan from the imf The currency promptly fell off a cliff plunging to an all-time lowListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow Egypt faces the task of rebuilding its foreign reserves The country expected current-account deficit and debt repayments over the next 18 months are roughly the same as its $33bn of reserves Tapping international debt markets is out of the question Economic turmoil will ward off foreign investors Thus Cairo will probably turn to old friends in the Gulf Between October 2021 and March this year Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the uae lent Egypt $18bn to sit in its foreign reserves The imf reports that another package worth $5bn is in the works although it has not said where the money will be coming fromEgypt is not the only country reliant on this unusual form of foreign generosity In August Saudi Arabia renewed a $3bn deposit in Pakistan central bank It sits alongside a yuan-denominated offering from China worth $2bn And as Argentina struggles to keep the peso fixed against the dollar some 60% of its reserves come from a Chinese currency swap worth $23bnDepleted foreign reserves can become a central bankers’ nightmare Governments are left unable to make loan repayments withdrawals sometimes have to be limited and import controls introduced Basic goods shortages may follow In the worst-case scenario spooked foreign investors set off a currency crisis Deposits and swaps offer a quick fix The fine print of agreements tends to be kept hushed and interest rates low Officially Gulf lenders want their money back But renewals are common Given the speed with which Egypt and Pakistan have burnt through their reserves it is unclear whether they could return the funds if requiredWhen a deal is agreed the debtor suddenly gains a great deal more foreign liquidity For years Argentina yuan swap obscured the country rapidly declining pile of foreign funds But unlike Gulf lenders China attaches strict conditions to its money In some circumstances Argentine officials need China permission to use the cash Thus the imf says that although Argentina headline reserves are $39bn after deducting the swap lines and other adjustments the net figurewhich it focuses onis a rather less impressive $2bnInformal lending also becomes a problem if a friendship flounders In 2016 as Hezbollah an Iranian-backed militia gained ground in Lebanese politics Saudi Arabia signalled its displeasure by withdrawing deposits it had made in the country central bank Three years later pressure on foreign reserves contributed to Lebanon financial meltdown Egypt and Pakistan have in effect tied their foreign reserves to approval from the Gulf and Chinaa shaky basis for economic stabilityThe situation in Egypt may end up illustrating another problem with this sort of informal lending It is not entirely clear how the lenders’ deposits will be treated if the country defaults Their status would have to be tested during the restructuring process As Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank in New York notes this sets up the potential for a stand-off between donorsThe imf Egyptian loan on October 27th was more modest than expected and was dependent on additional bilateral funding Saudi Arabia loans were made earlier in the year when Egypt economic situation was not quite as dire Both sides now look keen to extract themselves from an awkward situation; neither wants to be on the hook for more big loans But nor do they want to lose their moneyor Egypt to go under As the two sides inch away checking the other is still in sight they will have to ensure Egypt does not collapse from beneath them For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,Financiers’ pronouncements on China do not match their actions,Hong Kong brands itself “Asia world city” a label that has been mostly deployed in mockery over the past three years of political suppression and pandemic-induced isolation Yet the city government would like to make the slogan true once again It had hoped the Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit which welcomed financial bigwigs on November 2nd would advertise the once semi-autonomous city return to the world Instead the event turned into another symbol of the headaches facing Western investors in China Mainland bankers with whom chief executives would have hobnobbed could not attend without ten days of quarantine on their return home American lawmakers urged executives not to go citing China human-rights record Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina stockmarket offers another illustration of the forces battering once-optimistic investors Although it inched up slightly in recent days on unfounded rumours that China “zero covid” policy may soon come to an end the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index a basket of Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks is down by almost 40% this year The lack of any change of tone at the Communist Party Congress in mid-October led to the most recent lurch Warning lights elsewhere are also flashing red A deteriorating property market threatens to upend China economic-growth model Souring relations with America have led to new trade restrictions most recently on advanced chips Yet for much of the past decade big investment houses have made rosy predictions about Chinese stocks Speaking in Hong Kong Colm Kelleher the chairman of ubs said that global bankers were all “very pro-China” Last year analysts at Nomura a Japanese bank predicted that the 2020s would be “the decade to double down on Chinese equities” At around the same time BlackRock an investment firm suggested that allocations to China should be two to three times their current level of around 4% in major indices JPMorgan Chase long-term capital-market assumptions published in mid-2020 projected annual returns to domestic Chinese stocks of 8% over the next 15 yearsCould those firms have foreseen today difficulties or is that just the wisdom of hindsight? The pandemic and the Chinese government reaction to it was difficult to anticipate In 2016 Tim Atwill then at Parametric Portfolio Associates a provider of direct-indexing services was a lonely sceptic on the matter of including domestic Chinese stocks in the major emerging-market indices He argued that the broader industry was “blindly accepting a major allocation to a market that has shown little interest in the rights of foreign investors” The abolition of presidential term limits in 2018 when Xi Jinping began to entrench himself at the top of Chinese politics should have been a moment for introspection The direction of travel was abundantly clear by the time Mr Xi began to crack down on the country tech giants in 2020However the reality is that the bulls are rather less bullish than they appear at first glance Even many funds that in public wax lyrical about Chinese investment opportunities limit themselves to allocations to China of just a few percentage points Domestic Chinese shares are given an inclusion ratio of 20% by msci an index provider in its benchmark stock indices meaning that their presence is a fifth of what it would be at a full market weighting This discrepancy between ebullience in public and a more measured approach in practice reflects two realisations The first is that speaking out against China has unwanted consequences After JPMorgan issued a report in March saying that China was uninvestible the bank lost its position as a lead underwriter for a listing in Hong Kong of a Chinese cloud-computing firm The second realisation is that investing in China now comes with a serious tail risk attached: that investments could one day go to zero should Chinese politics go horribly wrong or tensions over Taiwan ratchet up to the extent that trade and financial links between China and the West are severed entirely True China could easily plod along Yet the risk even if relatively small of a nightmare scenario warrants a more modest asset allocationone that offers exposure to the mainland but does not have the potential to sink a portfolio if the worst comes to pass For all the efforts to suggest otherwise in Hong Kong it is the likelihood of disaster that will have been on everyone mind Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The surprising maturity of the crypto-rave crowd Oct 27thCan Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Nov 3rd 2022,Even recession may not bring down Europe inflation,It is difficult to spot the peak when hiking in the fog What is true in the Alps is just as true for policymakers who are struggling with inflation In the euro zone consumer prices in October were 107% higher than a year earlier The European Central Bank ecb has increased interest rates by 075% for the second meeting in a row as it dutifully follows the path trodden by America Federal Reserve Officials very much hope the peak is around the corner Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOptimists among them point out that the euro zone implemented no major fiscal stimulus after the covid-19 pandemic unlike America which means inflation has been driven by supply shocks and energy prices rather than an overheating economy Recent spending packages in Europe have sought to cushion the blow from eye-watering energy prices not stimulate spending In the second quarter of the year consumption was less than 2% above the same period in 2019 In America it was 7% Moreover sentiment indicators suggest the European economy is heading for recession Wages have grown moderately and there is little sign of a wage-price spiral Current and future energy prices on wholesale markets have fallen from summer peaks Bottlenecks affecting everything from microchips to furniture have eased Perhaps the peak really is nearby Sadly the optimism will probably prove unfounded Lower energy prices take time to feed through to consumers Most are still seeing whopping rises France has the lowest inflation in the bloc at 71% in October in part because the government has capped gas and electricity prices Next year however prices will be allowed to increase by 15% adding to inflation In Germany many households have long-term contracts that are gradually renewed to reflect higher pricesAnd though in the glowing sun of a warm October wholesale prices for energy dipped the medium-term forecast is for a cold and dry winter which means they will probably rise again Worse still Vladimir Putin may escalate the energy war Energy and food prices comprise less than a third of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation But the trends in the rest of the basket are also worrying Prices for services and goods other than food and energy increased by an annualised 6% over the past three months Although energy prices may lie behind part of this shiftrestaurants need heat for instancethe size of the increase suggests inflation is spreading As Chris Marsh of Exante a research firm notes the situation looks unfortunately similar to that in America a few months ago Wage rises are likely to add to inflation So far European pay has increased little Unlike in America six in ten workers have collective-bargaining agreements which tend to run for a year or moremeaning it takes time for economic conditions to influence their pay Trade-union negotiators have limited demands aware that a wage-price spiral would come back to haunt them But negotiators’ patience is beginning to wear thin Germany public-sector unions will enter forthcoming negotiations seeking a raise of 105%The problem for bosses is that the labour market remains exceptionally tight The share of firms reporting that staff shortages are limiting their production is near record highs in both the manufacturing and service sectors One reason is the enormous backlog of orders from the pandemic Manufacturing firms have on average more than five months of work on their order books according to a recent survey up from four before covid struck Add to that the cohort of workers retiring each year in ageing countries such as Italy and Germany and a recipe is in place for a tight labour market throughout 2023All of this means the peak in inflation is probably some way off Nor will there be much relief at the top for the descent will be similarly tricky to navigate Energy prices should settle at a lower level next year which will bring down headline inflation But inflation in the rest of the economy may still be accelerating limiting the immediate drop Thus the fog will remainEven a recession if people expect it to be brief may not tame inflation In that case the ecb would have to tighten the screws once again “The Bundesbank in the 1970s didn’t even flinch when the economy weakened They were successful in conquering inflation” notes Mr Marsh This time round it may take something similar from the other central bank in Frankfurt For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 3rd 2022,How best to bring back manufacturing,Attitudes to manufacturing were a small but telling split in the cold war The Soviet Union had such a focus on industry that its statisticians kept services from the country measure of national income A year after the conflict ended Michael Boskin then the White House chief economist is said to have joked it did not matter whether the “chips” America produced were made from semiconductors or potatoes There are echoes in the present geopolitical face-off Xi Jinping China president is so focused on hard tech that he has cracked down on consumer-tech firmsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut Mr Boskin laissez-faire approach is no longer in vogue among Western policymakers They have introduced a sweep of policies intended to “onshore” manufacturing In July America Congress passed the Chips and Science Act which will dole out $52bn to the chip industry over five years mostly to subsidise domestic production Japan and Europe are also spending big on chips The majority of the eu €43bn $49bn package will subsidise “mega fabs” or cutting-edge chip-fabrication plants In August America also passed a climate-change package worth nearly $400bn stuffed with “made in the usa” subsidies to be spent over ten years West Virginia is getting wind farms; electric-vehicle battery factories are coming to Ohio Arguments for onshoring fit into two categories The first concern security More than 90% of advanced chips many needed for manufacturing weapons are made in Taiwanfar closer to China than is comfortable for the West The second concern economics Advocates claim that manufacturing can create mountains of well-paid jobs Economists are doubtful A paper published in 2018 by Teresa Fort of Dartmouth College Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and Peter Schott of the Yale School of Management finds that the number of jobs in American manufacturing has fallen considerably since 2000 but output has not That is in part because American industry has become more technologically intensive and therefore productive It is thus unlikely more high-tech factories will mean many more jobsBut there is another more subtle economic case for onshoring Gary Pisano and Willy Shih both of Harvard Business School argue that there can be broader “spillover” benefits to innovation from having a strong manufacturing base One way this happens is when research and development r&d on products is done next to the manufacturing of them This eases collaboration between the two stages which is especially important in the early days of new products A working paper by Ms Fort Wolfgang Keller of the University of Colorado and colleagues looks at innovation among American firms It finds that those that locate their manufacturing near their r&d produce more patents and citations Indeed the smaller the geographic distance between the manufacturing and innovation arms of a firm the more innovation ensuesWhat about when firms deem it better value-for-money to move production elsewhere? Another working paper by Lee Branstetter then of Carnegie Mellon University Britta Glennon of the University of Pennsylvania and colleagues examines just that In 2001 Taiwan lifted rules banning the offshoring of production to China but only for some products The study finds that offshoring did reduce the quantity of patents related to these products But it also freed up resources for r&d in adjacent types of products leading to more patents in these areas Mr Pisano and Mr Shih suggest that the benefits of locating r&d and manufacturing near one another depends on the type of work For instance when your columnist researched and wrote this article there was no reason for him to be located near the printer or distributor of The Economist because software neatly separates the two steps By contrast new biotech drugs often require r&d to be near production facilities because drug design is closely linked to the manufacturing process Semiconductors the subject of many of the recent round of industrial policies lie somewhere in between these two types of work A few firms like Nvidia in California only design chips and send the designs overseas to be made by other companies like tsmc a Taiwanese chip firm But Taiwan also has a burgeoning chip-design industry in part because of its advanced-manufacturing prowess which makes it easier for startups to prototype and test new ideasTo subsidise or not to subsidiseThat manufacturing sometimes boosts innovation does not justify the enormous price tag carried by subsidies Even many economists who sing industry praises concur Governments tend to be poor at picking industries and technologies to support And as Mr Pisano notes if there truly were big enough benefits to be found from moving r&d and manufacturing near one another firms would do it themselvesThe case of American competition with Japan in the 1980s and 1990s offers a useful parallel Just like now policymakers in Washington worried about losing market share in advanced-tech manufacturing But as Mr Branstetter and colleagues noted in a paper in 2013 a falling market share did not stop American firms from better capitalising on the software boom that followed One difference between the countries was openness to immigration American firms could simply draw on a bigger pool of programmers Mr Branstetter also notes that Japan government incentivised hardware manufacturing delaying a pivot to softwareIn a twist of fate such openness to foreign talent may support manufacturing at home Another working paper by Ms Glennon finds strong evidence that restrictions on h1b visas which are intended for employment of high-skilled foreigners lead to more offshoring as firms are forced to head abroad for talent That is an inconvenient finding for the many politicians who both support domestic manufacturing and are loth to increase immigration Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to escape scientific stagnation Oct 27thWhy inflation refuses to go away Oct 19thEnergy shocks can have perverse consequences Oct 13thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Nov 2nd 2022,The Fed delivers another jumbo rate rise and it far from done,As recently as the start of June investors and analysts believed that a “jumbo” interest-rate rise for the Federal Reserve meant half a percentage point How quaint After four straight increases of three-quarters of a percentage pointthe latest on November 2ndperceptions have changed Indeed a stockmarket rally in the two weeks before the announcement was rooted in the belief that the Fed may scale down to a half-point rate increase at its next meeting in December What was once jumbo is now moderateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhether the Fed will in fact downshift to a half-point increase is a matter for debate Bond pricing assigns roughly even odds to the central bank opting for that smaller increment versus yet another three-quarter-point increase At a news conference following the Fed latest move Jerome Powell the central bank chairman resisted tipping his hand in either direction And for good reason: inflation figures for both October and November will be published before the Fed next meeting and go a long way to determining what it does There is little sense in guessing the outcome before seeing that dataBut the focus on the size of the rise is also too narrow As Mr Powell notes the Fed tightening of monetary policy can be looked at in three dimensions: how quickly it raises rates how high it raises them and how long it then keeps them there The first dimension is already clear Although the Fed was late in launching its rate-rise cycle it has moved with alacrity since starting raising short-term borrowing rates from 0% in March to 375% nowits most aggressive increase in four decadesThe second dimension is also becoming clearer In September the median expectation of Fed officials was that rates would peak at 46% next year Bond pricing now has the peak pegged at 5% reflecting the fact that a variety of inflation indicators have stayed stubbornly high Mr Powell suggested that the Fed thinking is in line with the bond market Even so there is a logic for slightly smaller increases from here on Just as an aeroplane slows before landing so ideally does a central bank before settling on its peak rateThe biggest uncertainty surrounds the final dimension How long will the Fed need to keep rates at a restrictive level? It estimates that the long-term neutral levelthat which is neither inflationary nor stimulativeis about 25% By this yardstick nominal rates are already in restrictive territory But in real terms with inflation still running at more than 8% annually policy remains loose So the question is when the economy will react to themSome developments have been predictable Mortgage rates have more than doubled over the past year exceeding 7% That has led to a sharp fall in house purchases But the resilience of the labour market has been harder to predict There are still nearly twice as many job openings as there are unemployed people placing upward pressure on wages and in turn inflationAt several points during the conference Mr Powell emphasised that the Fed would keep rates high for as long as is required Markets have priced in a pivot before the end of 2023 The view is the Fed will trim rates in the second half of the year But it has raised them faster and higher than investors had expected There is a good chance it will also keep them high for longer than investors currently expect For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

are not accounted for on lenders’ balance-sheets and include a dizzying array of financial products As a result the stock of these assets has fallen by 15% since 2017 but still amounts to an astonishing 56trn yuan $8trn or a seventh of all banking-system assets And now that China economy is slowing investors are discovering that many financial products marketed as low-risk are in fact quite high-risk Xi Jinping China leader who has just secured a third term lists financial stability as one of his main aims The problem is that finding safe investments in China is becoming harder and harder Strict capital controls prevent people from putting their money to use overseas Chinese stockmarkets are volatile and offer miserable returns According to East Money a financial-data firm just 1% of local funds have produced any returns this year with investors losing money on the rest The property market long the main destination for investments thanks to ever-increasing home prices has been thrown into turmoil by a government crackdown on leverage Prices have fallen in many cities This means that China trust industry a major part of the country shadow-banking system and another popular investment destination has also been thrown into turmoil Trust products have high investment thresholds usually above 1m yuan and attract wealthier investors They are often sold by banks promising returns higher than deposits and channelling funds to riskier borrowers who otherwise might not be able to take out loans Property developers have been big borrowers Defaults used to be rare But as developers go bust they often fail to pay back loans Between 40-60% of assets at three large trust firmsMinsheng Wanxiang and Huachenare non-performing this year Anxin another large company reports that almost all of its assets have gone south Out of the 57bn yuan in investments on which trust firms defaulted in the first seven months of this year some 80% were linked to property loans Wang Zhen of Hwabao Securities a broker recently labelled these investments a “disaster zone”Ms Fang invested almost 10m yuan in two products in 2020 and 2021 They were sold by a Chinese branch of the Bank of East Asia bea which is based in Hong Kong but were issued by Minsheng She was assured by a bea salesperson that she could cash out by mid-2021 when she expected to need the funds to build a polyethylene plant But when that time came the funds were frozen Bank employees told her to wait A year on she and more than 200 other investors with hundreds of millions of yuan on the line have seen neither the principal or interest on the productsProtests at the bea have caught the authorities off guard Hundreds of people have shown up at bank branches over the past month At one gathering in Shanghai protesters demanding their money back surrounded the building for several hours The incident in some respects resembled a mini bank run with many customers asking to cash out of financial products and deposits The bank released a statement saying customers could still withdraw from their accountsThese protests are part of a broader trend In May people from across the country gathered in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou to protest against the freezing of 40bn yuan in deposits at six village banks The banks all owned by one tycoon had attracted deposits through online platforms promising high interest rates But the funds were misused and the tycoon fled The local government is now attempting to repay at least some of the customersIn August angry homebuyers gathered at a branch of Bohai Bank in Shanghai to demand more information on their mortgages for homes at a development that has halted construction owing to a lack of money Online rumours of a freeze on withdrawals also led to a run on deposits in September at one of Jiangsu province largest banks The bank eventually was able to calm its customers but was also forced to increase its capital base A shuddering seismographThe situation seems likely to worsen China central bank has identified 122 “high-risk” outfits among the country 1651 village banks Trust in these smaller banks is depleting; many customers are attempting to move their deposits to larger more established institutions At banks with weak balance-sheets it does not take long for this dynamic to turn into a crisis As Zongyuan Zoe Liu of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank in New York notes some village banks have been forced to cap withdrawals shorten business hours or even freeze accounts to avoid runs on deposits Such measures are only a short-term solution as they tend to trigger new panics and additional runs on depositsAll of this is bad news for Mr Xi There is a reason he has made financial stability a central aim A wobbling banking industry undermines support for his government And to people like Ms Fang as well as those who notice her protests China financial system has rarely seemed shakier For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

China is not shy of doing so It tweaks foreign-reserve requirements on commercial banks to manage the yuan and majority state-owned lenders sometimes intervene on the central bank behalf Things are not so easy in countries with more open capital accounts and less high-handed governmentsIn the early 2000s the last time the dollar was as strong the question of intervention by financial institutions did not arise simply because the funds were much smaller As recently as 2010 South Korea pension fund was a third of its current size Since then populations have aged and sought higher returnsand portfolios have ballooned The firms’ sales of domestic currencies to buy foreign assets has kept the yen won and Taiwanese dollar weak which was welcome until recentlyThe level of influence that officials can exert over institutions varies The Bank of Korea and the country pension fund entered a $10bn currency-swap deal last month The fund agreed to borrow dollars from the central bank in exchange for won rather than selling the currency on the open market relieving a potential source of pressure on its market value Taiwanese life insurers unlike South Korea pension fund are private firms Even so they can be prodded in the right direction Taiwan central bank now allows life insurers to remit $100m-150m a day to the country according to Reuters a news agency When the local currency was stronger the central bank had been reluctant to allow such transfersJapan gpif has not been recruited to combat the weakening yen but that has not stopped speculation that it might be eventually The fund could hedge more of its assets in yen which could have the effect of strengthening the currency says Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank “On pure financial-management grounds there a question of whether the gpif should have such a large share of its foreign-currency holdings held on an unhedged basis” he adds Although the dollar has slipped a little in recent days that does not change the picture for Asian officials who are still dealing with far weaker currencies than they would like They will probably continue intervening And they may be tempted to bring outside assets into play For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

Perhaps an image of sweaty programmers swaying out of sync to thumping house music some boorishly shouting over it to discuss the latest crypto-token they are flogging their enthusiasm amplified by illicit substances Given the crypto community penchant for spectacular hacks rug-pulls and general calamity something somewhere is surely going dangerously awry However the reality as your columnist discovered on October 12th is a little different Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe raveor “raave” as it was marketed to partygoersshe attended was thrown by Stani Kulechov the founder of Aave an open-source protocol through which people are able to lend or borrow various cryptocurrencies The protocol is one of the more successful decentralised-finance DeFi applications Mr Kulechov hails from Finland and the word “aave” is Finnish for “ghost” which is the protocol logo He throws a chic party The raave was held on the sidelines of Devcon an annual conference hosted by the Ethereum Foundation a non-profit organisation that brings together developers working on Ethereum the second-most valuable blockchain This year the conference was in Bogotá the capital of Colombia The party took place in a converted warehouse filled with plants to evoke a jungle theme The bar served spicy mezcalitas Veronika Fleyta a British dj manned the decks The toilets worked There were even taxis waiting outside to take tired raavers to bedFar from being rammed with nerds the crowd was a mixed bunch Attendees included a Colombian girl who had participated in a hackathon before the conference kicked off a French programmer who was working on a method to distribute aid via Ethereum and a cheerful Mexican guy waiting in line for a raave t-shirt emblazoned with a “friendly ghost” logo in headphones None of them tried to shill tokens It was a grown-up eventone which reflects a newfound maturity among a community more commonly known as anything but Aave is a five-year-old company with a successful project it has spun off to be run by the community through what is known as a “decentralised autonomous organisation” or “dao” Its founder is working on his next venture a social-media protocol called “lens” which will allow users to “own” their followers taking them from one social-media application to the next and thus switch apps without losing clout The party is not the only evidence crypto is a more mature industry now Despite prices plunging into another so-called “crypto winter” the market capitalisation of all tokens is still around $1trn the same as in early 2020 Slumps no longer lead to questions about whether the end is nigh At Devcon several firms announced that despite the crash they had raised capital from venture firms UniSwap Labs founded by the creator of UniSwap another successful DeFi protocol raised $165m at a $17bn valuation Established venture-capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz which participated in the fundraising round are sticking with crypto Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the tech is getting better too Devcon came on the heels of “the merge” when Ethereum switched the mechanism by which it adds data to its blockchain The change essentially eliminated Ethereum carbon footprint overnight The next technological improvements are likely to increase the scale and reduce the cost of transactions which should make Ethereum useful for more than just financial applications Still it would be unwise to assume that a pocket of maturity reflects the entire crypto community A few days before Devcon during a visit to Miami your columnist considered attending another crypto partythis one favoured by bitcoin bros It would have been in a nightclub in Wynwood a neighbourhood filled with pastel-coloured buildings and crypto firms The area is home to the headquarters of Blockchaincom a crypto-trading platform and will soon host the American base of ftx an exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried a well-known crypto billionaire First though she checked it was a good idea with the crowd who had gathered for a weekly bitcoin brunch at a Haitian restaurant “Ermthat is actually a strip club” one of them sheepishly replieda step too far even for a journalist willing to brave a crypto raveRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Can Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?

 Oct 26th 2022,Can Gary Gensler solve every problem in American finance?,Everyone in finance has an opinion of Gary Gensler To many the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission sec America main financial regulator is meddlesome and overreaching Mention him in crypto circles and you invite a convoluted description of a token or project followed by the speaker hissing: “How can that be a security?!” His plans have raised the eyebrows of other policymakers alarmed lobbyists in Washington and panicked much of Wall Street One bank boss sneers that his agenda is ridiculous So broad are his aims “he must think he is an Avenger” assuming he can “swoop in and fix every problem in finance”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is impressive to have made such an impression after 18 months at the helm In Mr Gensler brief time in office he has made filings to propose or finalise 40 sets of rules At this point Jay Clayton his Republican predecessor had made just a third as many and Mary Jo White the Democrat who preceded Mr Clayton around two-thirds see chart Mr Gensler is keeping his speechwriter busy too Since assuming office he has given 60 speeches twice as many as Mr Clayton in his whole tenure Mr Gensler has even found the time to charge Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting a crypto securityYet Mr Gensler does not seem the type to court controversy He speaks with the precision of a central banker and avoids talking about specific firms or rules his agency has not opined on When discussing thorny problems in an interview with The Economist he frequently appeals to first principlessuch as fairness for investors level playing fields between market institutions and safe investingwhich he wants to be the legacy of his time in office Perhaps Mr Gensler critics are driven to ad hominem attacks because it is hard otherwise to undermine his authority No one can accuse him of being underqualified in finance or regulation Mr Gensler cut his teeth on Wall Street joining Goldman Sachs at 22 By 30 he was one of the bank youngest-ever partners He then worked at the Treasury during Bill Clinton presidency and ran the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission under Barack Obama “He wrote a lot of Dodd-Frank He is a very smart man” says the boss of a big firm referring to America post-financial-crisis legislation “He is not someone I would want to go up against” He even understands crypto much to the chagrin of those who wish to paint him as someone who does not “get it” In 2018 he taught a course on blockchains for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology business school which is available in its entirety on YouTube It reveals both a deep knowledge of the tech and the fact that years in regulation have not dulled Mr Gensler capitalist instincts In his first lecture he quizzed students on what they wanted from the class When reviewing the results the next week he revealed that five people had admitted their aim was to make money: “And I applaud those who said that because: Own it You’re in a business school Why not?” he grinnedMr Gensler frenetic activity partly reflects the chaotic time he started the job He was appointed in April 2021 a year after the Treasury marketthe world most important financial marketseized up during a pandemic-induced dash for cash A financial boom was roaring Beeple an artist had just sold a non-fungible token for $69m kicking off a frenzy for crypto assets Special-purpose acquisition vehicles spacs were raising billions of dollars a week And retail traders enabled by new apps were kicking off a 50-fold increase in shares of GameStop an electronics-retail firm pushing short-sellers brokers and the stock-settlement system to the brink Little surprise then that Mr Gensler has grand plans He wants to change the settlement system to reduce the risk facing retail brokers He also thinks the Treasury market should be centrally cleared so that a single institution stands between buyers and sellers taking counterparty risk This he explains is because central clearing promotes competition In doing so it also “enhances and expands access lowers counterparty risk helps broaden the marketand on the margin results in a bit more liquidity” His ideas do not stop there Mr Gensler has proposed rules to force spacs to match the disclosure requirements of initial public offerings the mere suggestion of which was enough to quell fundraising His suggestions for climate disclosure would force firms to measure and report on emissions in regulatory filings New rules are imminent on the structure of stockmarkets and the process by which retail brokers direct stock orders to intermediaries known as payment by order flow The sec seems fixated on levelling the playing field between the exchanges which are limited in how they make and quote prices and the wholesalers which are not “I can’t prejudge where we’ll come out” says Mr Gensler “But our goal is about enhancing the competition and lowering the costs”Many of these suggestions such as reducing settlement times or centrally clearing Treasuries are sensible and have support from market participants But Mr Gensler has not shied away from topics such as environmental rules or stockmarket structure that are controversial and surely will attract legal challenges Nor is he inclined to let accusations of overreach impede him Congress has proposed several bills to clarify the authority the sec has over the crypto industry Mr Gensler does not appear to believe they are necessary “I think it pretty clear I think that nearly 90 years ago Congress painted with a broad brush” when defining the powers of regulators he says “And I’m quoting Thurgood Marshall there the famous Supreme Court Justice who wrote that in the 1970s”Cynics think this sweeping agenda is a ploy to draw attention “Clearly he has got his eye on higher office” says one referring to gossip he wants a top government job But Mr Gensler more controversial plansin crypto say or the structure of stockmarketsdo hew to the principles by which he is most animated such as fairness and consumer protection Perhaps the idea that Mr Gensler will soon move on is nothing more than wishful thinking He has plenty of power where he is For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only

 Oct 26th 2022,How to escape scientific stagnation,In 2008 ben jones of Northwestern University formalised a simple yet powerful observation The more knowledge humans have the longer it takes a budding researcher to get to the frontier and thus to push things forward In a paper provocatively titled “The burden of knowledge and the death of the Renaissance man” Mr Jones argued humanity growing knowledge would slow scientific progress and thus economic growth More recent research has solidified this view In 2020 economists at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology mit published another provocatively titled paper “Are ideas getting harder to find?” which concluded that in areas from crop yields to microchip density new ideas were indeed getting harder to findListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe slowdown has spurred academics and policymakers looking to bolster scientific enterprise Many are turning to darpa a cold war outfit which funds high-risk “moonshot” research for inspiration Last year the National Institutes of Health nih America largest science funder launched a new arm with an annual budget of $1bn called arpa-h Other countries including Britain and Germany have set up their own versions In July America Congress authorised nearly $200bn in new scientific funding over the next decade although it is yet to stump up the cash in the process creating a branch of the National Science Foundation nsf for applied science and tech Philanthropists are joining the action too: their funding of basic research has nearly doubled in the past decade All these efforts aim to help science get back its risk-loving mojo In a working paper published last year Chiara Franzoni of the polimi Graduate School of Management and Paula Stephan of Georgia State University look at a number of measures of risk based on analyses of text and the variability of citations These suggest science reward structure discourages academics from taking chances The most common way research is funded through peer reviewin which academics in similar fields score proposalsdeserves some blame In 2017 using a data set of almost 100000 nih grant applications Danielle Li then of Harvard University found that reviewers seem to favour ideas similar to their own expertise If a project must satisfy a committee it is not surprising that unorthodox ideas struggle to make it throughThis suggests that breaking bad funding habits should make a difference The dARPA model which has more in common with venture capital than traditional funding structures is an attempt to do just that It empowers programme directors to finance high-risk high-reward projects with a bent towards real-world use But though it has proved successful in the defence industryfunding groundbreaking technologies from the early internet to gpsit may not be quite as successful elsewhere A book chapter published in February by Ms Li and Pierre Azoulay at mit notes that the darpa model does best when its programme directors have a clear understanding of the sort of breakthroughs that are needed This is often the case at darpa itself where both the funder and user of new tech is the defence department In areas like energy or health care things are rather less straightforward The end users are many and dispersed rather than a single government department Indeed other work by Mr Azoulay and colleagues notes that although arpa-e an energy-focused outfit launched in 2009 is still in its relatively early days it is yet to produce advances on a par with its defence-orientated predecessorAnother approach in vogue is to fund “people not projects” Most conventional grants fund specific projects for a specific amount of time usually a few years which researchers worry prevents them from pivoting to new ideas when old ones do not work out and fails to allot enough time for risky ones to come to fruition A study in 2011 compared researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute where they are granted considerable flexibility over their research agendas and lots of time to carry out investigations with similarly accomplished ones funded by a standard nih programme The study found that researchers at the institute took more risks As a result they produced nearly twice as much highly cited work as well as a third more “flops” articles with fewer citations than their previously least-cited work These results may be hard to replicate elsewhere Researchers at the Howard Hughes institute are selected for attributes that suggest they will thrive in such a flexible environment But the gap is big enough to indicate that others may also benefit from more freedomThe science of scienceDespite the uncertainty about exactly how best to fund scientific research economists are confident of two things The first is that a one-size-fits-all approach is not the right answer says Heidi Williams of Stanford University darpa models the Howard Hughes Medical Institute curiosity-driven method and even handing out grants by lottery as the New Zealand Health Research Council has tried all have their uses Evaluation of them can then build knowledge of what works says Matt Clancy an economist who curates a continuously updated online literature survey on innovation itself an experiment in how to improve science The second is that this burst of experimentation must continue The boss of the nsf Sethuraman Panchanathan agrees He is looking to reassess projects whose reviews are highly variablea possible indication of unorthodoxy He is also interested in a Willy Wonka-style funding mechanism called the “Golden Ticket” which would allow a single reviewer to champion a project even if his or her peers do not agree Mr Clancy notes that many venture-capital partnerships employ similar policies because they prioritise the upside of long-shot projects rather than seeking to minimise failure Thus far there is little quantitative evidence on whether Golden Tickets produce Golden Outcomes All the more reason to try them Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why inflation refuses to go away Oct 19thEnergy shocks can have

 Oct 23rd 2022,Even super-tight policy is not bringing down inflation,It feels a little unfair In July 2021 as rate-setters in America and Europe dismissed the risk of entrenched inflation the Central Bank of Chile got its act together Worried that inflation would rise and stay high its policymakers voted to lift rates from 05% to 075% The bank has since raised rates again and again outpacing investors’ expectations and taking the policy rate all the way up to 1125% Perhaps no other central bank has pursued price stability with such dedication Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHas the star pupil been rewarded? Hardly In September Chile prices rose by 14% year on year The central bank preferred measure of “core” inflation which excludes volatile components like energy and food jumped to 11% Chile example speaks to a wider problem Many pundits say that if only the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and others had “got ahead of the curve” by quickly raising rates last year the world would not be struggling with high inflation today The experience of Chile and other places that tightened early and aggressively casts doubt on that argument All over the world it is proving extraordinarily difficult to crush price rises The Economist has gathered data on Chile and seven other countries in which the central bank started a tightening cycle at least a year ago and did so after having slashed interest rates to an all-time low early in the covid-19 pandemic see chart  The group includes Brazil Hungary New Zealand Norway South Korea Peru and Poland Although Russia would have qualified we have excluded it because its circumstances are unique Call the unlikely gang “Hikelandia” In the year to October the median economy in Hikelandia raised rates by six percentage points If as expected the Fed raises rates by 075 percentage points on November 2nd America cumulative increase over the past year will still be nowhere near as big Unsurprisingly turning the monetary screws has slowed Hikelandia economy The property market has come off the boil as mortgage rates have risen House prices are drifting down in New Zealand South Korea pandemic housing boom has ended Goldman Sachs a bank produces a “current-activity indicator” a real-time measure of economic strength Using its data we find that Hikelandia economy is weakening relative to the global average And there is worse to come Chile central bank expects gdp to shrink next year Inflation however remains stubborn see chart 2 Central banks often focus on the rate of core inflation which better reflects domestic inflationary pressures In September core inflation in Hikelandia hit 95% year on year up 35 percentage points from March Worse still the gap between global core inflation and Hikelandia reading seems to be widening not shrinkingDig into the national statistics of Hikelandia and the trends become even more concerning Chile wage growth continues to accelerate In September South Korea inflation rate in the labour-intensive service sector was 42% year on year its highest since the early 2000s In the past six months Hungary service-sector inflation has climbed from 72% to 115% Across the club inflation is becoming more dispersed affecting a wider range of goods and services In September the price of 89% of the components in Norway inflation basket rose by more than 2% year on year up from 53% six months before In research on Poland published in late September economists at Goldman Sachs found evidence that “underlying inflation momentum has picked up again” Hikelandia struggles raise three possibilities The first is that it is currently unrealistic to expect inflation to fall Research suggests that there are lags sometimes long ones between tighter monetary policy and lower inflation It is also tricky to control inflation when almost every currency is depreciating against the dollar making imports more expensive All this may be true But after being surprised again and again by inflation you would be brave to bet that Hikelandia inflation will soon be anywhere near central banks’ targets even if conditions begin to improveThe second possibility is that policymakers including those in Hikelandia have not been sufficiently courageous Perhaps central banks should have raised interest rates more aggressively This is an argument stridently made by Chile remaining “Chicago Boys” libertarian economists who spearheaded the country free-market reforms in the 1970s Governments might also do more to help out After ramping up spending when the pandemic struck the median budget deficit in Hikelandia has fallen but is still wide at 3% of gdp Further increases to taxes or cuts to public spending would help reduce demand Yet this strategy carries risks too Implementing austerity during a cost-of-living crisis would be deeply unpopular And Chile which has nonetheless taken the plunge and is forecast to run a budget surplus this year is still seeing little payoff in terms of lower inflationThat leads to a third possibilityand the most worrying one Perhaps inflation is simply harder to stop than anyone could have predicted a year ago A report published in the summer by the Bank for International Settlements a club for central banks hinted at this possibility In a “low-inflation regime” the norm before the pandemic no one paid much attention to prices ensuring they did not rise quickly But in a “high-inflation regime” such as in the 1970s households and firms start to track inflation closely leading in time to “behavioural changes that could entrench it” If the world has shifted from one norm to another then different tools may be needed to cool prices For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance

 Oct 20th 2022,Can Britain escape the “moron risk premium”?,After a month of being exciting for all the wrong reasons Britain bond market is at last settling down All it took was an emergency bond-buying programme from the central bank the defenestration of a chancellor the installation of a sensible successor the humiliation of a prime minister and the shredding of a vast unfunded tax-cutting package that set the fiasco in motion Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt the height of the chaos Britain five-year borrowing costs were higher than those of Italy and Greece two countries that have difficult relationships with their lenders Although the markets are now calmer the country sovereign bonds or “gilts” still trade at much higher yields than they did before the self-inflicted blow Dario Perkins of ts Lombard an investment-research firm has dubbed this a “moron risk premium” What does the premium mean for Jeremy Hunt the new chancellor as he seeks to restore order to the country finances?It is important to remember that countries are not companies Familiar measures from the corporate-bond market do not mean the same thing when applied to sovereign debt If two American firms borrow in dollars at different rates the implication is that the one with the lower rate is the more creditworthy In some cases this works for government debt too such as for countries like Argentina and Colombia that borrow a lot in another country currency the American dollar or for those like Germany and Italy that share a currency and a central bank But for the most part it does not America ten-year yield is higher than Slovakia That does not mean America government is the riskier prospect Similarly Britain has not suddenly morphed into one of the euro zone more troubled membersInstead government-bond yields reflect a wealth of interlinked factors Chief among these is the expected future path for the interest rate set by the central bank whose currency is being borrowed There is information about inflation which may force the bank to raise rates gdp growth which may make it more sanguine about doing so and unemployment which may make it more reluctant There is a judgment about the central bank own hawkishness or dovishness Then there are the other risks If the currency is likely to weaken foreign investors should demand a higher yield to compensate If inflation remains untamed the value of both interest payments and principal will be eroded also requiring a higher yield There is little doubt the actions of Britain government have pumped up gilt yields But these yields say as much about the country economic trajectory as they do about its government credibility with investorsOne way to sharpen the picture is to take the government-bond yield for a given maturity and subtract the average interest rate the market expects from the central bank over that period Known as the “asset-swap spread” this is analogous to the credit spread for a corporate borrower For the long-dated gilts that sparked Britain near-meltdown the measure did indeed balloon in the last week of September before falling back to lesser levels once the Bank of England intervened Yet asset-swap spreads are also contaminated by other factors like demand for government debt for use as collateral or liability matching A better option is to look at the cost to insure a government debt Credit-default swaps are bilateral contracts where one counterparty agrees to insure the other against the loss due to default on a specified bond in exchange for a fixed stream of payments The fixed stream is quoted as a percentage of the amount insured or “spread” and implies a probability of default for the issuer of the underlying bond Britain credit-default swaps trade at far lower spreads than those of Italy which means the market perceives Britain risk of default to be much lowerIf yields are a bad guide to risk their volatility is a better one Daily movements are measured in “basis points” or hundredths of a percentage point It tells you something that the intraday range for British 30-year gilts on September 28th spanned 127 of them more than the annual range in all but four of the last 27 years Before the blow-up the largest daily increase had been a mere 29 basis points Since then similar-sized moves have become routine Britain sovereign debt is not flashing red with bankruptcy risk But its chancellor and his successors face a long and grinding slog to convince investors that gilts are once again a safe betRead more from Buttonwood our columnist

elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAustralian house prices have dropped for five straight months placing Quakers Hill at the forefront of a global trend As central banks race to tame inflation they are raising interest rates at the fastest pace in at least four decadeswhich is now translating into housing-market carnage Prices are falling in nine of the 18 countries monitored by Oxford Economics a consultancy and are dropping fastest in the most overheated markets In Canada and Sweden they have fallen by more than 8% since February; in New Zealand they have fallen by more than 12% since their peak last year Prices have begun sliding in America and Britain too Many other countries are heading in the same direction Transactions are also down Home sales in America fell by a fifth in August compared with the previous year according to the National Association of Realtors a lobby group In New Zealand quarterly sales were at their weakest since 2010 in the three months to June The share prices of large British builders such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey have halved this year Those of dr Horton and Lennar America biggest are down by more than 30% This represents the end of a long boomone which many homeowners have come to take for granted Rock-bottom mortgage rates and constrained supply fuelled a steady rise in rich-world house prices in the decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 Prices in America for instance rose by nearly 60% from their trough in 2012 to the end of 2019 Then came the pandemic during which prices truly rocketed In America Canada and the Netherlands they are up by more than 30% since 2020 Lockdowns and the shift to remote work increased demand for suburban properties with gardens or offices Governments worried about a housing crunch as covid spread temporarily eased or removed mortgage regulations making it easier to buy Pandemic savings helped first-time buyers stump up hefty deposits But interest-rate rises have now returned mortgage rates to levels not seen for decades A year ago the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in America was below 3% Today it is only a little shy of 7% In New Zealand mortgage rates have passed 7% for the first time in eight years; in Britain the average five-year fixed-rate loan now exceeds 6% for the first time in a dozen This will make life more difficult for prospective buyers and will increase the chance of distress among existing homeowners It is a change that is likely to carry uncomfortable political and social consequences for many years to comeThree factors will determine where the pain is most acute and thus where these consequences are most likely The first is recent price growth Housing markets where prices have surged since the pandemic are especially vulnerable to cooling demand While many rich countries slowed to annual growth rates in the single digits at the start of this year America and Canada maintained double-digit rises fuelled by huge demand for housing in the mountain towns and sunbelt states that attract well-heeled Californians and New Yorkers along with cities like Toronto Borrowing levels are the second factor The higher household debt is as a share of income the more vulnerable owners are to higher mortgage payments and defaults Central bankers will find solace in the fact that household debt relative to income is lower than it was on the eve of the global financial crisis in countries including America Britain and Spain Yet some countries face a mountain of debt This makes them sensitive to even small rises in mortgage rates Households in Australia Canada and Sweden which managed to escape the full brunt of the financial crisis have run up staggering borrowings in the years since prompting warnings from financial watchdogs As Stefan Ingves governor of Sweden central bank has put it: “It like sitting on top of a volcano”The third factor is the speed with which higher interest rates pass through to homeowners The biggest risk is to borrowers on floating-rate mortgages which fluctuate with changes in policy rates They face an immediate reduction in their disposable income In Canada variable-rate mortgages account for more than half of all loans In Australia and Sweden they account for nearly two-thirds In other countries fixed-term borrowing is much more common which means that rate rises pass through with a considerable lag The vast majority of mortgages in America are on such terms These mortgages are also more popular than before across Europe But not all fixed-term loans are alike In America the bulk of them are fixed for two or three decades In other countries even fixed-rate borrowers will face soaring mortgage costs soon enough In New Zealand fixed-rate mortgages make up the bulk of existing loans but more than 70% have a maturity of less than two years So do nearly half of those that were taken out in Britain last year Bring this together and all the ingredients for a deep housing slump are in place This time though it is likely to be led not by America but by Canada the Netherlands Australia New Zealand and Norway see table In Australia and Canada prices could plunge by as much as 14% from their peak a little more than is expected in America or Britain according to forecasts from a number of property firms Economists at the Royal Bank of Canada expect the country volume of sales to plummet by more than 40% in 2022-23exceeding the 38% drop in 2008-09Pain thresholdsWithin each country some people will suffer more than others The credit quality of the average borrower has improved in recent years as tighter regulations introduced following the global financial crisis have made it more difficult for riskier borrowers to take out mortgages But the toxic combination of a rate shock and a surge in living costs will put homeowners under severe strain In Australia for instance three-fifths of housing credit is on variable terms According to the central bank latest financial-stability report published on October 7th half of these borrowers would see their spare cash or that left after mortgage and essential living expenses fall by at least a fifth if interest rates rise in line with market expectationsand 15% would see this measure turn negative In Britain nearly 2m households or a quarter of those with mortgages could see higher payments absorb an additional 10% of their household income by early 2025 In the Netherlands the share of homeowners paying more than a quarter of their income towards their mortgage would rise from 12% to 26% if interest rates were to rise by three percentage points First-time buyers and recent borrowers are especially vulnerable Many stretched their finances to buy a home leaving less spare cash to cover a jump in mortgage costs In America first-time buyers counted for one in three sales last year Many have meagre savings Around half of Australian buyers who took out loans between the start of 2021 and August 2022 had less than three months’ worth of mortgage payments set aside for a rainy day Millennials who have at last managed to buy a property are in for a nasty surpriseFirst-time buyers have also had less time to accumulate equity Oxford Economics estimates that a 15% drop in house prices in America over a year would cancel out two-thirds of the housing equity they have accumulated since the start of the pandemic By contrast older owners are more secure More than half of American homeowners aged 65 or over moved in before the turn of the millennium This leaves new owners at greater risk of being pushed into negative equity which makes it hard to move house or remortgage In Britain a 20% fall in house prices would leave as many as 5% of mortgages in negative equity according to Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts a consultancy Around one in ten mortgage-holders in London would be affectedThe good news is that banks should be able to weather the slump In 2007-09 a rise in unpaid debt pushed some American ones to the brink Banks in Britain now hold nearly four times as much capital to cover losses according to Capital Economics another consultancy The Bank of England latest stress test suggests the country lenders would be able to absorb a 33% fall in house prices and a rise in the unemployment rate from 35% to 12% In America banks have stepped back from the mortgage market with non-banks now providing more than half of new mortgage lending Thus risks are no longer concentrated in systemically important lenders Still the housing squeeze will have profound consequences “The housing cycle IS the business cycle” wrote Edward Leamer of the University of California Los Angeles in a paper published in 2007 It noted that housing slowdowns had preceded eight of the past ten recessions in America After the financial crisis Mr Leamer followed up with a paper entitled “Housing really is the business cycle” in case readers had failed to get the message The link between the two cycles arises because housing confers “wealth effects” on owner occupiers When house prices rise people feel good about their financial situation so borrow and spend more When they fall people tighten their belts In 2019 research by the Bank of England found that a 10% increase in house prices raises consumption by 035–05% Another important channel between the housing market and the rest of the economy is investment Capital spending associated with housing especially house building can be extremely volatileand is often the difference between a growing or shrinking economy Indeed falling residential investment accounted for a third of the fall in America gdp in 2007-09 Research on Britain has found similar results House builders chase booms and scarper at bad economic news As worries have mounted this time round American private housing starts have fallen by 20% since April This time strained borrowers already cash-strapped because of inflation and hefty energy bills will also spend less on other goods and services as they try to meet their higher mortgage payments Some people see an upside to a housing crash They hope lower prices will allow young folk to buy their first houses These hopes are almost certain to be dashed In housing corrections and sometimes for years after home ownership rates tend to fall rather than rise In Britain for instance about 65% of people own their own home down from 70% at the start of the global financial crisis In Ireland which experienced an almighty crash in the late 2000s the home ownership rate is still more than ten percentage points below its peak Economic conditions that cause house prices to fall simultaneously imperil the chances of would-be homeowners Unemployment rises and wages decline If interest rates jump people are able to borrow less and mortgage lenders tend to become more skittish about lending In Canada increased borrowing costs will “swamp” any savings from a lower purchase price predicts Tsur Somerville of the University of British Columbia The residential is politicalThe biggest effect of a housing downturn may be in politics In countries where home ownership is seen as a rite of passage lower prices without any increase in affordability will rub salt in already sore wounds “Falling to what? Falling to absurdly grotesque prices instead of just unthinkable?” asks Robin Black a community worker and bike mechanic in Montreal “Basically I’ve accepted that dream is over I missed the window” A few millennials have scrimped to afford a deposit; now they will have to struggle to make much higher mortgage payments The threat of repossession lurks Losing your house is a possibility in a way it was not beforeFor years more established homeowners took comfort in the thought that even if real-wage growth was terrible at least the price of their house was rising Those days are over Even baby-boomers the great winners from a decade of price growth now face the prospect of living off a smaller nest-egg in retirement as downsizing becomes less lucrative All this means rising interest rates will have unpredictable political repurcussions as people who once benefited from the status quo discover what it feels like to lose outDo not be surprised then if policymakers launch enormous rescue operations Already Hungary government has offered its citizens protection from rising mortgage interest rates In its analysis of New Zealand housing the imf worries that “policy support may be needed to avoid second-round effects and a pronounced downturn” In Spain banks are reportedly considering limiting payment increases on variable-rate mortgages Martin Lewis a British financial pundit who has more influence than all the country newspapers combined has started to campaign for state support for mortgage-holders As house prices fall to earth such demands will only grow For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 19th 2022,Why inflation refuses to go away,If the return of high inflation caught many off guard its refusal to leave has been more shocking stillin the past week countries including America and Britain have been surprised yet again by high prices The Federal Reserve goofed when it forecast in December 2020 that prices would rise by less than 2% in each of the following two years It goofed on a grander scale in December 2021 when it reckoned that inflation in 2022 would be just 26% even though prices were already rising by more than 5% a year But the Fed was hardly alone in its misjudgments imf forecasts have badly and repeatedly undershot inflation And in late 2020 this newspaper correctly judged that prices would jump in the months ahead but concluded that the odds of a more sustained period of inflation were low Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhy then has inflation been so damnably persistent? In one sense the answer is trivial: it has remained high because spending has remained high and because monetary policy has been too loose But this is an unsatisfying answer Policy has not been tighter because central banks did not think it needed to be see the errant forecasts And as inflation has persisted policy has adjusted Back in December 2020 the Fed thought its interest rate would remain near zero in 2023; now it expects it to rise to at least 46% What is trickier to work out is why inflation has repeatedly defied forecasts New work produced by a penitent imf takes a stab at the question Its analysis points to three potential culprits: shocks wages and expectations In 2020 and 2021 as the covid-19 pandemic interfered with the production of goods and services governments unleashed a torrent of fiscal aid Meanwhile the peculiar conditions faced by households led to dramatic shifts in consumption which swung sharply towards goods and then back towards services After an initial deflationary pulse the net effect of this turmoil was to push up prices Last year about 40% of the rise in American prices relative to the pre-pandemic trend and 66% of the rise in euro-area prices was attributable to disruptions to production and higher commodity prices the imf calculates Generous stimulus and shifts in household spending accounted for another 30% in both America and EuropeThe barrage of shocks continued with Russia invasion of Ukraine in February With the exception of those for America and China errors in the imf inflation forecasts for big economies have in fact been larger this year than last And although problems projecting core inflation were chiefly responsible for bad forecasts last year underestimates of contributions from food and energy have been the bigger problems this oneThe effect of Vladimir Putin war has been compounded by a shock rise in the value of the dollar which is largely a product of the Fed aggressive campaign against domestic inflation As other currencies weaken their economies’ import costs rise exacerbating inflation troubles In a note published on October 14th Gita Gopinath the imf deputy managing director and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas the fund chief economist calculate that a 10% appreciation in the value of the dollar raises consumer-price inflation in foreign economies by about 1% on average with larger effects in places more dependent on importsStrong wage growth is the second suspect In normal times wage growth is mostly determined by labour productivity inflation expectations and the presence or absence of labour-market slack Faster productivity growth and higher expected inflation translate into more wage growth; higher unemployment translates into less In the early stages of the pandemic these relationships broke down According to the imf analysis fundamentals mattered less than the intense constraints on labour supply associated with lockdowns and social distancing As the recovery kicked in normal patterns began to assert themselves Yet this has not helped much with wages The supply of labour has become less of a problem but pay packets have kept growing thanks to robust hiring and low unemployment Rising wages power consumer spending and contribute directly to higher prices for labour-intensive services Indeed some hawks worry about a wage-price spiral in which workers demand higher pay to cover rising prices as firms raise prices to cover rising wage bills Yet the imf work suggests some caution is in order Although wage growth has been strong in many countries it has not been strong enough to keep up with inflation Sinking real wages can act as a drag on spending and inflation A study of 22 historical episodes comparable to this oneduring which nominal pay rose and both unemployment and real wages fellfinds that wage-price spirals rarely emerge In the median episode inflation began to fall even as unemployment remained low which is a near-ideal scenario for policymakersNevertheless it persistedThere are caveats Tighter monetary policy was required to slow inflation in most cases The unusual nature of present circumstances may mean that past experience is of dubious relevance And crucially much depends on what happens to inflation expectationsa third and unpredictable inflationary force People beliefs about the future affect their consumption and wage bargaining If recent experience looms large in the formation of these beliefs that would help to explain persistent inflation and would complicate central bankers’ jobsBeliefs are tricky to measure but there is nevertheless some cause for concern Although measures of expectations in America have been relatively well-behaved those in Britain and the eu are less encouraging That as much as anything is why interest rates will keep climbing Having been fooled and fooled again central banks will not relent until the only inflation surprises are those on the downside Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Energy shocks can have perverse consequences Oct 13thWhy China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan Oct 6thEconomists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep 29thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter

And as the world faces another energy shock what lessons can be learnt from its failure?Economists believe that technological progress is the ultimate driving force of growth The key question is what determines this progress direction In 1932 John Hicks an economist started the debate about “directed technical change” when he theorised in his book “The Theory of Wages” that raising the price of a certain factor of productionlabour in his examplewould spur innovation to bring down its cost In the century prior to his book publication wages had risen steadily which meant there was an incentive for employers to invest in labour-saving technologies rather than capital-saving ones Following this logic a spike in fossil-fuel prices should help to accelerate decarbonisation Such green growth is not inevitable however Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has pointed out that research spending can be directed either to clean substitutes such as solar power or complements to dirty tech such as more efficient engines For a firm the choice of where to direct money depends on the sometimes competing forces of price and market size An oil shock which raises the price of the fuel makes green technologies such as solar power more attractive But the extremely widespread use of hydrocarbons may make investments in fossil-fuel efficiency known as grey technologies more profitableThat was pretty much what happened in the 1970s Although some money was spent on projects like the Danish zero-energy house and in the embryonic renewables market much more went on grey technologies Research by Valerie Ramey of the University of California San Diego and Daniel Vine of the Federal Reserve finds that the main way historical oil shocks have affected the American economy is by encouraging consumers to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles The economy of a typical American car improved from 13 miles a gallon in 1975 to 20 miles a gallon in 1980 Rather than pocketing the savings offered by more fuel-efficient cars Americans instead bought even bigger ones and in greater numbers Thus the long-term impact of the oil shock was not to kill the country car cultureit was to wedge the combustion engine even deeper into American life By the mid-1980s oil consumption was higher than a decade before even though many of the country power plants had switched to natural gas Environmental economists call this phenomenonwhere fuel-saving measures perversely raise demandthe “rebound effect” Something similar happened in Danish housing Better insulation improved its energy efficiency; as a result houses grew larger and their owners more used to higher temperatures It became common for example to wear t-shirts indoors during winter According to official statistics total housing energy consumption has been unchanged for the past three decades Mr Acemoglu argues there is “path dependency” in technological progress Energy efficiency can make it harder for other technologies to compete A well-insulated house with a state-of-the-art gas boiler uses less fuel But that makes the upfront investment of an electric heat pump less appealing If Europe industry successfully maintains output this winter while using less gas it may in the future have less incentive to switch to green methods Differences from previous energy shocks offer some room for optimism Economic modellers point to the “elasticity of substitution” as the critical measure for whether expensive fossil fuels accelerate the adoption of green or grey technologies Encouragingly this elasticity has increased since the 1970s Today a rise in price should encourage more switching away from fossil fuels than in the past thanks to the wider availability and lower cost of green alternatives Green thumbsMoreover carbon prices place government thumbs on the scale The cost of a permit in the eu cap-and-trade scheme is only expected to rise in the future as the cap on the quantity of emissions falls meaning firms have an incentive to get ahead of the curve With luck this will limit the rebound effect in the years ahead But America is going down a different road Subsidising clean technologies rather than taxing dirty onesthe strategy adopted by President Joe Biden recent Inflation Reduction Actdoes not do nearly as much to displace fossil fuels A family may buy a subsidised battery-powered vehicle for instance but only to complement a fossil-fuel one which they can continue to drive without penalty Policy design matters if a zero-carbon world is to become more than just another future that never happened For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletterRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan Oct 6thEconomists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep 29thChina rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy Sep 22nd

rising interest rates investors have tightened their purse strings As a result fintech funding has collapsed see chart The average deal has fallen from $32m in 2021 to $20m in 2022 Between July and September a mere six firms graduated to unicorn status achieving a valuation of $1bn or more compared with 48 in the same period last year Exits have also stalled There were 27 public listings in the last quarter of 2021 compared with two in the one just passedThe speed of the slump has caught many in the industry by surprise A year ago fintech founders were like “kids in a candy store” says Jeff Tijssen of Bain a consultancy Plentiful venture-capital funding allowed them to launch into foreign markets make bold acquisitions and hire the best staff Future revenue was richly valued and startups chased growth at all costs Now “a dollar of revenue” is worth considerably less says Michael Treskow of Eight Roads a venture-capital firm and not all revenue is “equal” As investors demand a path to profitability founders’ wings are being clipped Employees meanwhile are heading elsewhere Whizz kids previously up for a gamble are slinking off to consultancies and banks Many need a new job anyway: fintechs have sacked 7300 staff since AprilThe shift started in the public markets where the ten largest fintechs have lost $850bn in value in the past year As the route to initial-public offerings became more difficult the biggest private firms began to be affected Some cash-strapped giants including Klarna a buy-now-pay-later lender have seen their valuations slashed by more than 80% in “down” funding rounds Those still closing “up rounds” including Acorns an investing app are often doing so on tough terms guaranteeing that new backers will double their money even in the “worst-case” forecasts All of this is common to other tech sectors But fintechs look especially vulnerable because many are directly exposed to the risk of recession Lenders that used cheap funding to provide online mortgages and buy-now-pay-later loans face soaring costs and rising defaults Neobanks that rely on transaction fees are being starved of revenues Businesses that banked on the boom in retail investing from crypto exchanges to online brokers are suffering as trading volumes collapse Those catering to small firms may well go under with their wobbly clients Thus many startups will struggle to make it through winter But those that provide essential services to digitising firms should keep attracting venture-capital funds many of which have money lying unspent In America alone their collective “dry powder” hit $290bn in the last quarter twice the average from 2016 to 2020 With consumer spending set to crash in Europe American startups are valued at a premium says Lily Shaw of Omers Ventures the venture-capital arm of a Canadian pension fund Beyond this geographic trend three types of fintech firms look best equipped to attract venture-capital doshFirst are companies that reduce inefficiencies from the management of company expenses to the reconciliation of business payments and thus ought to help companies cut back in more difficult times Next are firms that create new revenue lines for their clients such as enabling a travel agent to sell their customers insurance The final group includes financial plumbers from firms providing data or ones dabbling in crypto to those that help banks comply with sanctions Only a few fortunate upstartssuch as GoCardless which facilitates recurring bank-to-bank payments and Clearbank which provides cloud-based payments softwaretick all three boxes They run the infrastructure that moves money around at a time when the dominant “rails” remain costly think of those 3% credit-card fees and old-fashioned firms want to

 Oct 13th 2022,Rates are rising at unprecedented speed When will they bite?,If you want to impress central bankers inject “long and variable lags” into a conversation and heave a heavy sigh The phrase coined by Milton Friedman a Nobel-prizewinning economist is sophisticated shorthand for the delayed and uncertain effects of monetary policy Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRaising rates as most central banks are now doing should lead to slower growth and lower inflation But it can take time for the full impact to be felt Hence Friedman idea of a long lag The variability meanwhile refers to the lack of a predictable interval between raise and result Lags present an acute challenge at the moment Tightening in the past few decades has been gradual helping to mitigate uncertainty This time central banks are furiously ratcheting up rates The Federal Reserve is on course to raise them from a floor of 0% to 4% by the end of this year its steepest tightening in four decades Economists including Ben Bernanke a former chairman of the Fed and a new Nobel laureate estimate lags between monetary policy and inflation can last as long as two years The result is that America may be digesting the jumbo rate rises of the past few months well into 2024 by which time the economic picture will look different This is one reason why some economists are calling for central banks to switch to smaller rate rises if any They want policymakers to survey the impact thus far in order to avoid needlessly adding to future pain Yet the mere existence of lags cannot be an argument for inaction They are a known unknown Their precise duration may be uncertain but the fact that there will be a delay is well understood Any decent model contains assumptions about this Fed officials expect to shift from raising to cutting rates in 2024 and 2025 But they also expect inflation to continue to recede in both those yearsan indication of how lags are baked into their forecastsMoreover an increase in central-bank transparency may be compressing lags In America mortgage rates had increased by a full percentage point even before the Fed had raised short-term rates This has not happened in previous cycles and represents the fastest pricing-in of expectations in at least four decades see chart As a result the housing market has had at least half a year to respond to higher mortgage rates Sure enough home sales prices and new construction have all started to fall In a way the Fed is lagging the market: its rate increases are in part ratifying expectations that are already influencing activityNone of this is to minimise the risk from lags Friedman believed they all but doomed counter-cyclical interventions He viewed such attempts as “disturbances with a peculiarly high potential for mischief” Central bankers are more confident But persistent inflation does underscore Friedman point about the challenges of getting policy right whether tightening or easing Today woes stem in part from aggressive stimulus in 2020 and 2021The mischief in other words can cut both ways Doves worry that excessive tightening will lead to a bad recession Hawks fear that a premature halt will lead to continued bad inflation Both worry the Fed will get its timing wrong again just in diametrically opposite directions For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 13th 2022,Credit-default swaps are an unfairly maligned derivative,Vultures rats and maggots are often the focus of disgust less because of anything for which they can be blamed and more because of the conditions with which they are associated Death disease and squalor carry a stigma that is hard to shake Something similar is true of credit-default swaps financial instruments that make headlines during market turmoil and economic miseryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen charts of credit-default swap prices begin to crop up in financial research it is invariably a bad sign Russia invasion of Ukraine prompted a burst of activity with conditions in both Kyiv and Moscow triggering swaps and thus interest in the instruments More recently prices for European banks have jumped The cost of a five-year credit-default swap for Credit Suisse bonds has surged to twice the level reached in the market mayhem at the start of covid-19But like the scavenging bird hovering above a weary desert beast the swaps have an important role to play They insure the buyer against the default of a bond or an index of bonds As with other index products the inclusion of a range of swaps creates more liquidity The instruments can protect portfolios and counterparties from volatility and be used to speculate on individual firms’ health and broader market conditionsThe role swaps played in the financial crisis did not help their reputation Their market more than quadrupled in size from 2005 to 2007 Institutions that had written huge volumes of swaps including aig an insurer were hit with bills they had thought would not all come at once An inquiry into the crisis causes judged that over-the-counter derivatives particularly credit-default swaps were a significant contributor In 2009 Charlie Munger the venerable second-in-command of Berkshire Hathaway an investment firm endorsed a ban The eu prohibited one way of using swaps As recently as 2018 the Vatican said credit-default swaps were “less acceptable from the perspective of ethics respectful of the truth and the common good”Yet the market today is unrecognisable from the one 15 years ago Back then it was roughly the same size as the market for foreign-exchange swaps Today it is not even a tenth as big Some 60% of the outstanding market now relates to credit-default-swap indices rather than a particular company bond This compares with 43% at the market peak Trading in index products is much more liquidThings are safer in other ways too The standardisation of credit-default-swap coupons has made it easier for the assets to be traded through clearing houses More than half of single-firm credit-default swaps and two-thirds of index ones are now cleared compared with 6% and 16% in mid-2010 when data collection began This reduces counterparty risk where investors fear that a dealer of derivatives might collapse and fail to honour their obligations This danger loomed large during the financial crisis Trading is now operating as the architects of the system would have hoped As inflation has surged and interest rates have climbed market activity has surged with interest in protection against defaults rising The trading volume of index credit-default swaps is up by 68% in the year to date compared with the same period last year With over two months to go this year is already the strongest on record for trading volumes since data collection began in 2013 A paper by Robert Czech of the Bank of England suggests that credit-default-swap contracts make the underlying corporate bonds more liquid too particularly at a time of rating downgrades when liquidity can otherwise dry up Research by Martin Oehmke of the London School of Economics and Adam Zawadowski of the Central European University comes to a similar conclusion They find that credit-default-swap markets provide an alternative venue for speculation and hedging activity to the underlying corporate bond market This enhances overall liquidityThere will almost certainly be jitters as more use is made of credit-default swaps Payouts can lead to protracted legal proceedings The recent payout on swaps against Russian sovereign debt was surprisingly straightforward given the trickiness caused by sanctions Holders received 44 cents on the dollar after a special auction to determine the contracts’ value Yet the significant changes to the market since the financial crisis appear to be bearing fruit As markets get choppy credit-default swaps are likely to play a positive role Pay no attention to the Vatican For more expert

One answer is that China conspicuous failures not least its ponzi-like property market and damaging “zero-covid” approach have obscured other areas of progress The economy is greener than it was Interest rates and the exchange rate are more flexible It has become easier for entrepreneurs to start a business and for foreign investors to move their money into China even as it has become harder for residents to get their money out China has replaced a clumsy turnover tax with a value-added tax It has allowed local governments to issue more bonds diminishing their need to raise money off the books And the country has successfully cut poverty and broadened its safety net A hard-luck storyThe reformers have also been unfortunate In Mr Xi second term they have had to contend with a trade war against America and the forever war against the covid-19 pandemic Mr Liu who led China protracted trade negotiations with the Trump administration was stretched thin America willingness to deny China access to vital technological imports also changed Mr Xi economic priorities He and his team could hardly be blamed for elevating self-reliance as a goal alongside opennessEven some of the reformers’ successes have had unwelcome side-effects China deleveraging campaign in 2016 is one example It succeeded in stopping runaway credit growth: the combined debt of China government households and non-financial companies grew little relative to the size of the country gdp in 2017 and 2018 But by cracking down on shadow banking China reformers made it harder for many private companies to obtain credit It is perhaps unfortunate that such an impressive cohort of reformers came to power at a time when macroeconomic stabilisation was a more urgent task than microeconomic liberalisationSome reforms have also backfired China restrictive limits on borrowing by property developers caused the housing slump which in turn exacerbated some of the financial risks the limits were designed to prevent An earlier attempt in 2015 to let the currency float more freely precipitated destabilising capital outflows These reforms as well as being clumsily executed were also poorly sequenced China eased capital controls before relaxing its grip on the yuan contrary to economic orthodoxy And by cracking down on the property market it has deprived local governments of much-needed income from land sales without having created an alternative source of revenue such as a real-estate taxIn some cases the sequence of reform was dictated by politics Introducing a nationwide property tax would be deeply unpopular Hence it has been repeatedly delayed Similarly the pacing of China currency reform was influenced by a largely symbolic goal: getting the yuan accepted by the imf as a “freely usable” international currency fit to be included in the organisation special-drawing-rights basket Reformers sometimes feel compelled to seize a window of political opportunity even if the timing is not economically ideal These compromises illustrate the deeper reason for the reformers’ failure Their initiatives have always been subordinate to Mr Xi broader political aims When economic development was the party overriding task the goals of the party matched the goals of economic reformers But under Mr Xi the party is pursuing another vision of national greatness in which economic efficiency is one goal among many Mr Xi wants the economy to be less susceptible to American pressure and more susceptible to party control It needs to be hardier and redder not merely bigger and better He wants qualified intelligent experienced cadres to implement this vision not their own After ten years of Mr Xi “I don’t think many people harbour the illusion that he going to unleash a wave of productivity-enhancing economic reforms with drive and vigour” says Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics a consultancy in Beijing But some nevertheless hope for a restoration of “pragmatism” he says They believe Mr Xi economic team can smooth his rougher edges and ensure orderliness in his policymaking Their job is to stop him “dashing around on campaigns to promote this and crack down on that” No one needs a crystal ball to know that after the party congress this month Xi Jinping will be the first name on the economic team sheet From the policymakers that join him investors expect not reform but restraint For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 13th 2022,Emerging markets look unusually resilient,The script is familiar A Federal Reserve bent on taming inflation mercilessly raises rates The dollar soars global financial conditions tighten and the world economy falls into a broad slowdown But this time there is a twist Where writers would normally pencil in an emerging-markets crisis there is instead an eerie calmListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor decades fast-growing middle-income countries have been a source of financial trouble In the early 1980s the Fed crusade against double-digit inflation sparked a Latin American debt crisis; in the 2010s the normalisation of policy after the global financial crisis rattled the “fragile five” Brazil India Indonesia South Africa and Turkey Much the same might have been expected during present tightening which is the most intense since the early 1980s In forecasts published on October 11th the imf again marked down its projections for global growth and warned that economies accounting for a third of global gdp are heading for downturns The world very poorest countries are on the ropes More than a billion people live in economies now facing severe distressAnd yet most big middle-income countries are weathering the storm The imf reckons that emerging economies will substantially outgrow rich ones this year and next despite a slowdown in China and a contraction in Russia While the euro pound and yen are tumbling against the dollar the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah have managed a more graceful decline and the currencies of Brazil and Mexico have risen see chart 1 Emergency central-bank intervention is unfolding in London rather than BrasíliaThe resilience of the emerging world is in part a story of maturation Since the crises of the 1980s and 1990s local financial markets have grown deeper and banks better managed Policymaking has improved Officials have learned the hazards of careless budgeting and large current-account deficits Central banks are more independent and have adopted the inflation-targeting approaches used in the rich world This sophistication and care has demonstrated its value over the past two years Many middle-income central banks began raising rates well in advance of rich countries This prevented rising inflation from slipping out of control and also stopped destabilising currency declines Take Brazil which experienced hyperinflation as recently as the early 1990s but has worked in recent decades to establish the credibility and independence of its central bank When inflation leapt and the real wobbled early last year the central bank responded with aggressive rate rises amounting to a cumulative increase of almost 12 percentage points Inflation has fallen from a peak of 12% in April to below 8%; the currency has been among the world best performing Meanwhile in the rich world central banks that have fallen behind the Fed tightening schedule like the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have experienced vertiginous currency depreciations and have yet to see inflation peakEmerging-market foreign-exchange regimes have also improved These economies once relied on exchange-rate pegs to contain inflation and secure cheaper credit But the years of crisis encouraged a move in the direction of floating-rate regimes in which markets get more of a say over a currency value Now most governments only occasionally intervene to lean against undesirably fast or big moves Many have paired this with deeper foreign-exchange reserves During good times they purchased assets denominated in reserve currencies like dollars This slows the pace of their currencies’ appreciation and builds a pile of safe assets In 1998 global foreign-exchange reserves amounted to 5% of world gdp By 2020 that figure had risen to 15% representing a staggering $13trn Although Chinese reserves of more than $3trn account for a large chunk other emerging-market governments have built up formidable piles India totals over $500bn for instance and Brazil is worth more than $300bn see chart 2These reserves can be deployed to slow a currency depreciation when investor risk appetite drops This year India has sold $40bn-worth to keep the rupee decline modest and orderly Yet reserves are most valuable in the thick of a crisis when they can be used to pay for critical imports and meet hard-currency debt repayments Crucially they help to reassure foreign investors that obligations will be honouredAnd emerging economies have addressed their greatest weakness: an inability to borrow in their own currency Governments once had no choice but to accept loans denominated in other currencies This vulnerabilityreferred to as “original sin”could turn a drop in investor sentiment into a financial catastrophe Because a fall in the local currency increased the burden of foreign-currency debt economic weakness or nervy markets could set in motion a cycle of capital flight increased pressure to devalue and lost confidence in the creditworthiness of the government which often ended in chaotic default But after the global financial crisis bond yields in the rich world tumbled pushing investors to look for returns elsewhere This hunt combined with improved economic management in emerging markets allowed officials to shift borrowing to local-currency bonds see chart 3 In the mid-2000s some 46% of Indonesian public debt and 83% of Chilean debt was owed in a foreign currency By 2021 those figures had fallen to 23% and 32% The safety purchased by these innovations is impressive But in a forbidding economic climate emerging markets cannot afford a victory lap Although governments have borrowed more in their own currencies many companies have notand if global woes force large firms to seek bail-outs their foreign obligations could become their governments’ foreign obligations If worsening financial conditions prompt a flight to safety a Fed focused squarely on high American inflation may not ride to the world rescue with a torrent of emergency lending as in March 2020Stability can also lead to greater risk-taking The healthier financial position of emerging markets has allowed some to take on debt that would once have seemed too high even for rich countries India debt has risen to 84% of gdp;

 Oct 10th 2022,Three economists win the Nobel for their work on bank runs,When the global financial crisis struck 15 years ago economists were forced to respond to criticism that they had for decades ignored the banking system With its choices for this year Nobel prize Sweden Royal Academy of Sciences honoured three economists who had in fact spent the previous decades examining bank instability Research by Ben Bernanke chair of the Federal Reserve during the crisis and an academic before that Douglas Diamond of the University of Chicago and Philip Dybvig of Washington University in St Louis was largely vindicated by the failure of the banks in 2008 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe three laureates’ central insight was that banks are not the neutral intermediaries between savers and borrowers that other economic models had assumed Instead they offer vital services to the wider economy: gathering information on borrowers providing a liquid means of saving and deciding to whom to extend credit From this insight flows an important conclusion: because banks are crucial to the economy they are also dangerous Mr Bernanke is best known as a central banker But it was his work at Stanford University that the committee cited They mentioned an article on economic history published in 1983 that looked at the causes of the Depression Unlike previous accounts Mr Bernanke emphasised the role of the banking system arguing that a self-sustaining cycle of bank runs caused the plunge in economic activity in the 1930s rather than just being a consequence of itIn this account Mr Bernanke focused on the role played by banks in providing credit The uncertainties inherent to lending and borrowing mean that such decisions require “information-gathering services” When banks failed in the 1930s new entrants could not easily replace them Unlike a grocer a new bank cannot simply move into its predecessor premises and set up shop Knowledge about borrowers is hard won This meant that farmers small firms and households all found credit more difficult to obtain during the Depression ensuring a vicious downturn A similar insight lies at the heart of the Diamond-Dybvig model of bank runs developed in 1983 by Mr Bernanke two fellow laureates Without banks the authors pointed out ordinary savers would be forced to invest directly in capital projects with long-term payouts These projects would then need to be cancelled whenever savers faced an unforeseen cost that meant they needed to dip into their savings Banks allow savers to pool their money and for these pooled savings to finance long-term investments Crucially savers may withdraw their cash at will which is known as liquidity In exchange banks take a slice of profits The process is called “maturity transformation” as it involves the transformation of an asset with a short maturity such as a bank deposit into a longer one such as a business loan The provision of this service makes banks vulnerable If lots of savers try to withdraw money at the same time perhaps because of a rumour that a bank will be unable to satisfy its creditors the bank will be forced to terminate its long-term investments and sell assets at deep discounts Such losses could cause the bank to collapse as happened in 2008 when a downturn in the American housing market spiralled into a system-wide banking crisisThere is an escape from this problem however which Messrs Diamond and Dybvig demonstrated by employing game theory It is rational for depositors to run on a bank so long as they believe others will But such a course of action becomes fruitless if they believe others will remain at home A system of insuring deposits such as the one instituted by the American government in 1933 or by a central bank acting as a “lender of last resort” can prevent runs from happening in the first placeThis insight was not entirely novel Walter Bagehot a former editor of The Economist suggested in 1873 that central banks could avoid financial panics by acting as a lender of last resort Likewise “It A Wonderful Life” a film released in 1946 and mentioned in the Nobel citation materials demonstrated both the mechanics of a bank run and the importance of confidence The hero soothes depositors with calming rhetoric and a capital injection from his honeymoon savings The “fundamental impact” of the laureates’ work in the committee words was to offer mathematically consistent models of this informal knowledge Their contribution perhaps was not to discover something new about the world but to communicate something that had been all too easily forgotten by other economists For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics finance and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly subscriber-only newsletter
 Oct 6th 2022,Why China policymakers are relaxed about a falling yuan,In 1988 paul krugman a Nobel-prizewinning economist wrote that it was “fairly likely” the world would soon shift away from freely floating exchange rates Governments would instead adopt a system of “broad target zones” promising to stop their currencies wandering too far above or below a fixed exchange rateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHe was wrongbut a version of this future can be seen in China Each morning its central bank sets an exchange rate for the yuan known as the “fix” China currency can float 2% above or below this rate each day The zone is narrower than Mr Krugman expected and its mid-point moves each morning in discrete steps Yet it is similar enough that economists at Hamburg University have called it a staircase-shaped “moving Krugman band system”The stairs have been steep of late Since mid-April the yuan has declined by about 10% against the dollar; a decline slowed but not stopped by the morning fix On its way down the currency has passed psychologically important thresholds In August it crossed 68 to the dollar close to the level at which the yuan was pegged after the global financial crisis of 2008-09 On September 26th the central bank set the fix at more than seven yuan to the dollar for the first time since the early stages of the covid-19 pandemicThe reason for this descent is clear America Federal Reserve has raised interest rates aggressively to curb inflation To stabilise the yuan China central bank could raise interest rates in tandem But tighter monetary policy would be at odds with the needs of its weak economy which is hampered by a property slump and draconian covid controlsWhat is less clear is where the bottom of the staircase lies and how sure-footed the descent will be Some analysts fear a repeat of 2015 when a poorly executed devaluation of the yuan provoked capital outflows that further undermined the currency But a rerun is unlikely The yuan is no longer overvalued Its target zone is better managed and its capital controls are better enforced In the past China kept its currency anchored to the dollar because it feared that a conspicuous drop would trigger a run on its currency The yuan decline against the dollar is now less likely to become disorderly For that reason China will try less hard to prevent it In assessing China currency choices economists sometimes invoke the “impossible trinity” A country might want exchange-rate stability monetary independence and free capital flows but it can have only two of these Rich countries typically make clear-cut choices As Joshua Aizenman of the University of Southern California has pointed out emerging economies are more ambivalent Many have adopted mixed positions embracing none of the objectives in full nor rejecting any entirely By imposing limited controls on capital say they can provide some stability to their exchange rate without entirely forgoing monetary independence China has clung to exchange-rate stability more than most The yuan has been less volatile than India rupee let alone South Africa rand or Brazil real But China has also adopted tighter capital controls especially since 2015 This can be inefficient and inconvenient It is however not outlawed by the impossible trinityChina can also take comfort from the economic fundamentals Despite its insulation from market forces its exchange rate is reasonably well priced Adjusted for inflation it is about 10% below its fair value according to the Institute of International Finance It has remained stable this year against a broader basket of currencies If only the fundamentals applied it ought not to plummetUnfortunately financial markets are not respectful of such calculations “Few will heed fundamentalsin times of turbulence and turmoil” as Zhou Xiaochuan then China central-bank governor put it in 2016 Expectations of yuan declines can become self-fulfilling regardless of the underlying state of the economyMr Krugman showed that target zones if credible could ameliorate this problem by converting speculators into stabilisers As the exchange rate reaches the bottom of the zone its room for further declines is limited Knowing that speculators would push it back to the middle The mere prospect of intervention by the authorities could make actual intervention unnecessaryThat did not work in China in 2015 partly because of the way its stairs were built Each morning fix was supposed to reflect the currency value at the end of the previous trading session Thus any speculative declines during trading could be embedded in the following morning fix Within any single day the zone might constrain the speculators But from one day to the next the speculators could move the zoneIn need of a fixTo restore stability and credibility China sold more than $700bn of foreign-exchange reserves in 2015-16 and enforced its capital controls more zealously It introduced a mysterious “counter-cyclical factor” in its calculation of the morning fix intended to offset any speculative momentum It also imposed a reserve requirement on banks that made it costlier to bet against the yuan That requirement was removed in 2020 only to be restored last monthHaving taken these measures China now seems more confident that the yuan can fall against the dollar without the fall becoming self-reinforcing For this reason the yuan now seems less anchored to America currency Economists have looked at how faithfully the yuan mimics movements in the dollar against other currencies In the dark days of 2015 it moved one to one In recent years the dollar influence has steadily declined according to Chen Zhang of the National University of Singapore and colleagues falling from one to about 03 China might cling more tightly to the dollar in a period of great financial stress But it is otherwise unlikely to intervene heavily to defend any particular value of the yuan to the dollar The country policymakers do not mind if the yuan walks steadily down the stairs Just as long as it does not tumble Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Economists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work Sep

Several times in the recent past the market has broken down In 2014 a “flash rally” led to wild swings in prices for no clear reason In 2019 rates spiked in the “repo” market in which Treasuries can be swapped for cash overnight In March 2020 extreme illiquidity led yields to spike even though in times of panic they usually fall as investors rush to safe assets Now issues are cropping up again: measures of volatility have jumped to levels last seen in 2020 and bid-ask spreads are widening The problem stems from the fact that the Treasury market has doubled in size over the past decade even as its infrastructure has shrunk Trading is carried out by primary dealers designated institutions which are mostly big banksand regulatory requirements now constrain them The leverage ratio which limits the value of assets banks can hold relative to their capital does not care whether the asset is super-safe Treasuries or subprime mortgage debt Thus when a client calls asking to sell a bond banks must find a client who wants to buy it rather than holding it as inventory for when another client calls In times of stress this system gets overwhelmed The fixes fall into three buckets: let the banks trade more bonds with investors let investors trade more bonds with each other or let investors trade or swap more bonds with the Federal Reserve Start with letting the banks do more The solution would be to exempt Treasuries and other safe assets like bank reserves from inclusion in leverage ratios The Fed and other bank regulators did this for a year from March 2020 to help ease market chaos The logic behind the move was sound enough Treasuries are not risky assets likely to default and so they do not require much capital to be held against them Still the leverage ratio is appealing because it is simple to administer and cannot be gamed And with Democratic bank regulators in charge who do not want to appear to be undoing financial regulation the idea is a non-starter How about letting investors deal more with one another? Portfolio managers at pimco a large bond investment firm have proposed that investors should trade on a platform where asset managers dealers and non-bank liquidity providers can trade on a “level playing field with equal access to information” akin to how stocks are traded This could be good if it is actually possible Matching buyers and sellers of Treasuries is harder than matching buyers and sellers of stocks All shares in Microsoft are the same; there are dozens of Treasuries that have roughly five years to maturityA final fix would be to let investors do more with the Fed Last year the central bank created a standing repo facility which allows a Treasury to be swapped overnight for cash But the facility is only for primary dealers which do not always pass on the liquidity Opening it to more participants would address this problem It would also expose the Fed to a range of riskier counterpartiesbut that could be mitigated by requiring firms to swap a greater value in Treasuries than the central bank gives out in cashThe problem is not a shortage of plausible reforms It is that none of them have been implemented The heady bull market has collided with the reality of high inflation and much higher interest rates Financial markets have already entered a new phase in which volatility stress and fear have returned Any grand plans to overhaul the Treasury market cannot be implemented on the fly in the midst of a burgeoning crisisIf the Treasury market seizes up againas the market for British government bonds did after ministers announced a package of unfunded tax cuts on September 23rdthe task of fixing it will fall on the Fed and its bond-buying schemes Relaunching asset purchases at the same time as raising rates to combat inflation would be very uncomfortable Since regulators failed to fix the Treasury market when they had the chance they may end up with little choiceRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Investment banks are sharpening the axe Sep 29thHow to rebrand stockmarket indices Sep 22ndWhy investors should forget about delayed gratification Sep 15thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

China is running down its stockpiles in a bid to satiate its thirsty refiners The volume of oil on water may be rising but that is only thanks to the longer tanker journeys that are required as the market adjusts to sanctions rather than growth in floating storage notes Giovanni Serio of Vitol a trader The problem opec+ faces is that its credibility is in tatters Even the cut announced on October 5th is not what it seems Its members have failed to invest in production leading to a gap between target and actual output see chart In reality the cut will apply only to members that are hitting or are near to their targets Ehsan Khoman of MUFG a bank expects the revision to deliver a real cut of up to 11m b/dThe tactic is nevertheless workingat least for now The oil price has risen by 11% since September 26th when rumours of the cartel plans first emerged That makes the reduction worthwhile even for Saudi Arabia which will trim its output by 5% but ought to benefit from an increase in price twice the size Jorge León a former opec analyst now at Rystad Energy a consultancy reckons that Brent could surpass $100 by the end of the year After the meeting the Saudi energy minister said that unless the market changes the supply curbs will remain until the end of 2023 But the decision is not without risk opec+ market share is yet to recover from huge cuts it made in 2020 to shore up prices amid a collapse in demand Trimming production again may further erode the cartel market share The cut is also a snub to President Joe Biden who recently visited Saudi Arabia in an attempt to cajole it into pumping more before tough midterm elections next month The White House accused the cartel of “aligning with Russia” and announced that America would release another 10m barrels from its strategic reserve next month The decision also provides fuel to nopec a congressional bill that would allow the cartel to be sued under antitrust law although it will have to overcome opposition from lawmakers and oil firms who fear tit-for-tat measures opec+ loss of market share should be partly reversed when it eventually cranks up output again Thus it is the decision impact on demand with higher prices likely to further reduce consumer appetite that will probably do more damage to opec+ position Cutting output in a tight market also creates more volatility not lessand the extra uncertainty will discourage investors and lenders reducing liquidity in the paper oil markets The decision may also reignite diplomatic tensions within the cartel Since quotas no longer reflect actual output the latest cuts are being shouldered by just a handful of membersIraq Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the uaethat were already prevented from producing quite as much as they ideally would The uae which secured a small increase in July but plans to expand its production capacity from 4m b/d today to 5m b/d in 2025 will almost certainly agitate for a rejig in future negotiations This will be resisted by underperformers such as Angola and Nigeria says Robin Mills of Qamar Energy another consultancy in the hope that they can one day rebuild their capacityIronically Russia could offer the cartel a solution The country has long been a staunch advocate of higher production But its output is now likely to fall both soon as a result of a European embargo set to start in December and in the long run as sanctions prevent it from getting access to vital partners people and parts Saudi Arabia and the uae are in bed with “a weakening business partner” says Karen Young of Columbia University Russia will be reluctant to give away some of its quota The question is whether in a world where it has ever fewer friends doing so is a price worth paying to remain inside the tent For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 4th 2022,Financial markets are in trouble Where will the cracks appear?,It is hard not to feel a sense of foreboding As the Federal Reserve has tightened policy asset prices have plunged Stocks as measured by the Wilshire 5000 all-cap index have shed $12trn of market capitalisation since January Another $7trn has been wiped off bonds which have lost 14% of their value Some $2trn of crypto market-cap has vanished over the past year House prices adjust more slowly but are falling Mortgage rates have hit 7% up from 3% last year And this is all in Americaone of the world strongest economiesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRising rates will slow the American economy and should break the back of inflation But what else will they break? Since the Federal Reserve raised rates again on September 22nd global markets have been in turmoil When the British government announced unfunded tax cuts a day later fire-sales by pension funds caused the yield on government bonds or “gilts” to spiral out of control Contagion then spread to the American Treasury market which is as volatile and illiquid as it was at the start of covid-19 The cost to insure against the default of Credit Suisse a global bank has risen sharply These ructions indicate the world is entering a new phase in which financial markets no longer just reflect the pain of adjusting to the new economic contextpricing in higher rates and lower growthbut now also spread pain of their own The worst pain is felt when financial institutions fail There are two ways they do so: illiquidity or insolvency Tighter monetary policy is likely to prompt or reveal both It is illiquidity that comes firstand it has well and truly arrived Take the British pension funds They use a strategy called “liability-driven investing” to hedge against interest-rate moves When rates shot up they faced margin calls which they met by selling gilts Yields moved so fast that this became a fire-sale with prices spiralling downwards The Bank of England had to step in to buy bonds At least American pension funds do not treat their liabilities in the same way meaning they are unlikely to face similar blow upsBut pension funds are not the only bond holders that may face liquidity issues On October 4th the imf sounded the alarm about open-ended bonds funds which hold $41trn in assets a quarter of financial assets outside the banking system Investors can sell their holdings once a day “but it may take fund managers several days to sell assets to meet these redemptions especially when financial markets are volatile” warned the IMF That exposes them to moves in market pricing Outflows are amassing Investors have pulled 8% of their assets from these funds this year Credit costs are rising quickly as would be expected in such circumstances Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley a bank highlights how abrupt the shift has been: “In the most recent senior-loan-officers survey every single question they asked bankers about financial conditions flipped to tightening all at once I have never seen that before” Yet the real problem is when credit is unavailableno matter the price British traders report there were “no bids” for gilts in the days after the government announced its plans Measures of liquidity in the Treasury market have deteriorated too “We are seeing what happened in March 2020 again The same Treasury bonds are trading at different prices bid-ask spreads are widening” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford University Strategists at Bank of America describe their index of credit stress as “borderline critical” Stockmarkets have been just as turbulent but they have at least continued to function “You might not have liked the price you were seeing” says Tal Cohen of Nasdaq a stock exchange “but you were always seeing a price” He has yet to witness “demand destruction” the thinning out of the order book that occurs when buyers and sellers begin to pull their orders en masse This is despite the fact that Bank of America strategists think markets have fallen to levels at which losses may be forcing funds to sell assets to raise cash accelerating the sell-off Illiquidity in credit markets is enough of a problem It can morph into a total lack of lending Last week British banks rushed to pull mortgages from their proverbial shelves If this dynamic gets out of hand it can typically be solved by central banks stepping in and operating as a lenders of last resort as the Bank of England did The risk of doing so is not trivial however Such an intervention employs quantitative easing buying securities using central-bank moneythe path used by central banks to ease monetary policy Thus it might undermine faith in central bankers’ commitment to fighting inflation Market-watchers now wonder whether all this pressure will lead to insolvencies which happen when the value of an institution assets falls below its liabilities It is the fate which befell insurers including AIG and banks including Lehman Brothers in 2008 Homeowners across America defaulted on their loans meaning mortgage-backed securities assets many firms had bought were no longer worth anything close to their original purchase price Insolvency is fatal and only resolvable by bankruptcy or bail-outs The current tension is the first big test of a new-look financial system Regulators have sought to make systemically important institutionsas Lehman Brothers surely would have been designatedtoo safe to fail They have done this by compelling firms designated as such to follow stringent capital liquidity and risk-taking rules as well as by stress-testing them in hypothetical economic breakdowns Regulators have also tried to reduce opacity and counterparty riskthe channels through which fears about Lehman morphed into suspicion of the entire banking system The result is that there are layers of protection around the financial system most important institutions At the heart of markets are clearing houses which settle trades in stocks and derivatives between their members mostly big banks To join a clearing house a member must post an “initial margin” in case of default; that margin can climb if markets move The system is stress-tested against the default of even the clearing houses’ largest members such as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup The banks which stand between the clearing houses and other financial institutions are also in better shape The issues that precipitated the fall of Lehman Brothers were that the firm did not have enough capital at times leading up to its demise it held capital worth just 3% of assets had taken on too much borrowing holding debt worth 30 times its equity had a dubious business model making enormous bets on the American housing market and had taken on vast amounts of risk Today there are 30 banks designated as systemically important by regulators some 28 of which are in the kbw Nasdaq Global Bank Index which tracks bank stocks These 28 banks are funded with capital worth 13% of their risk-weighted assets see chart 1 and have debt worth five times their equity Despite this they do not get an entirely clean bill of health: some business models look fragile On average the banks returned profits worth 9% of their equity last quarter but the worst other than Credit Suisse returned just 4% It is hard to know whether any have taken huge risks “American banks are unequivocally much stronger” says a bank boss Few are making such statements about European banks and certainly nobody is about Credit Suisse The firm had a return on equity of minus 14% last quarter its share price has tumbled and its market capitalisation is now just $12bn Yet even Credit Suisse is not near a Lehman-style collapse It is funded with capital worth 14% of its risk-weighted assets Although Credit Suisse credit-default swaps which act like insurance against default have leapt see chart 2 they still suggest the chance of default is in the low to mid-single digitsBig banks head into the new era fortified But the regulation that has strengthened their defences has also diminished them High capital demands make it hard for them to compete Because they must add risk weights to all kinds of assets they now hold only boring stuff Leverage ratios constrain their size By contrast financial institutions that are not systemically important are unencumbered by these rules The impact can be seen on balance sheets In 2010 after the financial crisis banks held $115trn of financial assets Other financial institutions such as pension funds insurers and alternative asset managers held roughly the same amount In the years since the non-banks’ slice has grown By the end of 2020 they held assets worth $227trn a quarter more than the banks Similarly four-fifths of American mortgages came from banks before the financial crisis Today only around half do and most of these are sold on to investorsThus the dodgy stuff is probably in other institutions Which ones? In 2007 problems started in real estate This time Americans have far less mortgage debt but the sheer pace of price growth in residential housing suggests some buyers will face difficulties Indeed three-quarters of those who bought in the past two years regret their decision Other forms of real estate are also vulnerable Firms are downsizing their offices to adapt to working from home posing problems for highly leveraged commercial developers Charles Bendit of Taconic Partners a developer in New York notes that lots have opted for floating-rate debt meaning their debt-servicing costs have already doubled Michael Burry who shot to fame in 2008 after shorting mortgage-backed securities is concerned by unsecured consumer finance given the growth of “buy-now-pay-later” providers and the ease with which consumers have been able to tap credit-card lines Goldman Sachs a bank ventured into consumer credit in 2019 helping to launch the Apple card It now has an unusually high default rate of 3% over the past six months Ms Graseck of Morgan Stanley points out that because this is an interest rate-shock driven cycle trouble will probably first arrive in the loans that reprice to higher rates quickly: “Floating rate debt like credit cards is immediate then commercial real estate autos and eventually mortgages”One of the fastest-growing parts of private credit has been that offered to software-service firms notes Seth Bernstein boss of AllianceBernstein an asset manager “These have been fantastic cash machines because they have subscription models” The cash flows they provide have been used to secure financing meaning many firms are now highly leveraged They are also untested in a downturn Mr Bernstein compares the situation to the securitisation of housing debt in that there is very little information available about the debt It is companies more broadly that appear most at risk They owe debts worth 80% of gdp compared with 65% in 2007 A third of American corporate debt is rated BBB the lowest investment-grade rating Firms downgraded any further are not eligible for many investors’ portfolios Defaults are now arriving Bausch Health a health-care provider gave up the ghost on September 30th taking the default rate for high-yield issuers to its highest since June 2020 There is little to no appetite for fresh high-yield debtbanks that agreed to fund Elon Musk Twitter takeover in April will struggle to issue it without taking lossesWho holds these bad assets? Financial firms that have grown lots over the past 15 years are the first place to look Alternative assets which include private equity real estate and hedge funds have grown from just 8% of total financial assets in 2006 to 15% now They have taken paper losses of 11% on their investments this year a much smaller fall than in the public markets This might reflect sensible investmentor an unwillingness to adjust to reality Firms that have escaped the full weight of regulation are another place to look The Financial Stability and Oversight Council an outfit established by the Treasury to watch important financial institutions tried to claim oversight of the big insurance companies including MetLife AIG and Prudential But MetLife won a lawsuit to have the designation overturned and the council then rescinded its designations of the restIf lots of investors are washed out as they would be if a non-bank financial institution failed well “who cares?” quips one bank boss Given reforms since the last financial crisis it seems unlikely that there will be failures of institutions that are so big and important that governments need to bail them out The systemic institutions will survive another event like the blow-ups of the hedge funds LTCM in 1998 and Archegos in 2021 But that does not make life any easier for central banks It is their job to tighten policy enough to cool inflation without causing seriously disruptive activity in financial markets And it is looking increasingly difficult to do both For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 3rd 2022,Credit Suisse and the hunt for the weakest link in global finance,As interest rates rise and asset prices slump investors are scrambling to identify the weakest links in the global financial system Every bear market produces national and corporate victims who get skewered In the 1997-98 rout Thailand economy imploded as did LTCM a hedge fund Iceland and Lehman Brothers were victims in the 2008-09 slump Today one country has already been picked off: Britain where the currency has fallen and the central bank has had to intervene in the bond market to bail out the pension system whose overseers had foolishly made vast bets on continued low volatility Now some believe an institutional victim of the great 2022 sell-off in markets has been spotted: Credit Suisse a venerable Swiss firm that spans wealth-and-asset management private banking and investment banking Its shares have fallen by 55% this year and its credit-default swaps which measure default risk have risen These two red lights will be familiar to anyone who witnessed Wall Street firms struggling in 2008-09 as will the statements by Credit Suisse managers that the bank has a strong liquidity and capital position This year version of a confidence scare at a bank comes with a new twist too: a swirl of malicious mad and made-up rumours on Twitter and elsewhere Welcome to the too-big-to-fail problem in the social-media ageSo does the claim on the message boards that Credit Suisse is “next” make sense? At a high level the idea that a big bank shadow bank or investment firm might be in trouble is plausible The financial system has become habituated to 15 years of rock-bottom interest rates The hunt for yield has led insurers and other funds to stuff portfolios with long-duration assets that are ultra-sensitive to rising rates American banks have retreated from lending as regulations have grown tighter and instead a system of market-based credit has emerged that deals in trillions of dollars of low-quality debt There have been some medium-sized blowups already including of Archegos a hedge fund and Greensill a lenderFurthermore Credit Suisse has been poorly run and struggling for some time It has suffered repeated risk-management and compliance scandals including being exposed to losses from Archegos and Greensill Its top management ranks have been a revolving door Yet in most other respects it does not look like the epicentre of a financial explosion in the way that say Lehman or AIG an insurer were Instead of rampant growth fuelled by hubris Credit Suisse balance sheet has shrunk continuously over the past decade in dollar terms as it has downsized itself into the second tier of global finance Today it is the 54th biggest listed financial firm in the world by assets Its problems are idiosyncratic and to a degree an expression of management caution rather than recklessness It owns a sub-par investment banking unit that needs to be shrunk or shut down Based on the second-quarter results this division eats up 30% of its risk-adjusted assets and has annualised costs of SFr8bn $8bn It is largely to blame for the firm overall quarterly pre-tax loss of SFr117bn and awful return on equity of minus 14% Bitter experience from firms such as Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland teaches that shrinking an investment bank is a bit like decommissioning a nuclear reactor: dangerous and expensive Star bankers leave and business dries up faster than you can cut costs and quit long-term contracts leading to losses Investors’ main concern has been that these potential losses might be so big that Credit Suisse would have to raise equity to ensure it had enough capital to support its ongoing businesses which are fairly healthyWorries about financial firms can be self-fulfilling as counterparties charge a higher risk-premium to lend to or deal with the firm making it uncompetitive In order to bring down its borrowing costs Credit Suisse will have to convince investors that it has a better proposal for shrinking its investment bank without incurring massive upfront losses It plans to announce this on October 27th But so far at least Credit Suisse is not an example of a business model which in its spectacular excesses and implosion encapsulates a broader madness in the markets Instead it is an example of a relatively weak firm coming under pressure as financial conditions tighten and the economy flags There will be many more of these in many other industries Meanwhile the hunt in the markets for “the big one” will go on For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 2nd 2022,America economy is too strong for its own good,Two days after the latest interest-rate rise the seven governors of the Federal Reserve met with some businessfolk Any misgivings about the effects of tighter monetary policy would have been quickly dispelled Cara Walton of Harbour Results a consultancy spoke of a plastics processor who hired 14 new employees only for a mere three to show up on their first day and one of those to quit before lunch Cheetie Kumar a restaurateur said her peers were struggling to make rent as food and labour bills mounted Tom Henning of Cash-Wa a distribution company explained his firm was passing costs onto customers Demand was holding up he said thanks to the amount of money “floating out there in the economy”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMisgivings may however have crept back in as the governors watched the markets over the past fortnight The central bank goal is to tame inflation which is running at more than 8% year on year just shy of a four-decade high The realisation that it is still far from that goal and that monetary tightening will thus continue is causing havoc American stocks have fallen for three consecutive quarters and sharply recently Bond prices are tumbling reflecting tremors in the credit markets The ratcheting up of rates in America is driving the dollar appreciation adding to inflationary pressure elsewhere and impelling other central banks to follow the Fed lead no matter the state of their economies On September 30th Lael Brainard the Fed vice chair called for her fellow governors to proceed “deliberately” a word denoting caution in the central bank argot She also said the Fed would take its international impact into account This was an acknowledgment of the risks of the current approachit was not an indication that the central bank is about to change tack The Fed simply cannot ignore the strength of the domestic economy Even with the financial upheaval America economy is straining at its limits in critical dimensions In the labour market there are nearly two jobs available for every unemployed person Wages up roughly 7% compared with a year earlier are rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s according to the Atlanta Fed Although house prices declined month on month in August new home sales jumped confounding expectations Corporate profits are at their highest in decades as a share of gdp Despite higher rates consumer confidence has been climbing This constitutes a serious challenge for America central bankers The more resilient the economy the harder they will have to push to rein in inflation There is always a lag between shifts in monetary policy and their impact on real activity; recent rate rises will inevitably take a toll on the American economy over the coming year Yet additional jumbo rate rises remain on the cards see chart 1 heightening the risk of a monetary mistake and an eventual recession To get a sense of why despite the brewing trouble the Fed is still hawkish it is crucial to understand why the economy has remained insulated this far Fuel in the tankThe most obvious factor explaining this insulation also explains America inflation: the government was a lot more aggressive than others in stimulating the economy during the covid-19 pandemic America primary budget deficitthe difference between government spending and revenues excluding interest paymentsaveraged 105% in 2020 and 2021 more than triple its level before the pandemic and higher than all other big rich countries Formally this stimulus ended some time ago The last big short-term fiscal package was President Joe Biden American Rescue Plan ARP in March last year But in reality stimulus is still working its way through the system Hefty dollops of ARP cash are only just hitting the economy States were granted about $200bn in direct emergency funding In August they had yet to draw on a fifth of that And they are still doling out the funding they have claimed In the past couple of weeks alone Louisville Kentucky announced it would spend ARP funds on affordable housing; Monroe Country New York directed some of its money to health services; and Cumberland Country Tennessee splashed out on water and sewer projectsEven more important is how the stimulus continues to puff up the balance sheets of both people and firms Households sit on about $2trn in excess savings relative to their pre-pandemic norm They are now beginning to eat into this buffersavings rates are well down this year But the reserves have enabled them to spend at a decent clip even as inflation has eroded their incomes It has been a similar story for businesses At the start of the third quarter they had about $28trn of cash in hand down from the start of the year but about a quarter more than before the pandemic They have also taken advantage of robust demand to pass on inflated input costs to customers protecting their margins and then some Post-tax corporate profits reached 12% of GDP in the second quarter the highest since at least the 1940s So long as companies are making profits they look to hire not fire workersNor has growth been hindered as it has in Europe by soaring energy costs following Russia invasion of Ukraine Indeed America has in one sense benefited from the invasion Exports of both crude oil and petroleum products are at an all-time high In net terms America has exported about 1m barrels a day of crude and petroleum products since Russia invasion of Ukraineall the more remarkable given that America was a net importer to the tune of 10m barrels a day at the start of the century The boom in oil-export earnings has contributed to a narrowing of America trade deficit which may flatter its growth figures over the rest of this yearAmerican consumers have been considerably less enthusiastic about higher prices at the pump If they compared themselves with their peers in Europe they might be more sanguine Natural-gas prices have historically been a smidgen higher in Europe than America These days they are about five times higher Europe has been gradually cut off from Russia its main gas supplier; America is awash with its own energy It has only limited liquefaction capacity which is needed for exports meaning the gas it releases from the ground is mostly consumed domestically In Europe monetary tightening is compounded by the negative shock from soaring energy prices which is why forecasters expect a deeper recession In America the Fed can more or less look beyond the ructions in the energy marketsHouse correctionSooner or later continued rate rises will drag on the American economy That after all is the Fed intention The most rate-sensitive sectors are already being hit Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have reached 7% the highest in more than a decade A steep rise in credit-card balances suggests that some households are starting to exhaust their savings Higher interest rates will only make debts more onerous Corporate profits also look set to flagone reason for the recent stock-market plungeNevertheless a slow steady return to normality after covid acts as something of a buffer against these dangers Take the property market The inventory of homes available for sale remains very low by historical standards in part because the supply of building materials just like other goods has been badly constrained over the past few years A leap in mortgage rates would usually be expected to lead to a precipitous slowdown in construction activity This time though builders are still building trying to work through the backlog of unfinished homesMeanwhile goods consumption shot up during the pandemic as people bought new sofas bigger televisions and fancier exercise bikes for their homes Now they are returning to cruises and concerts see chart 2 This shift matters for the job market because services tend to be more labour-intensive Even if consumers spend less in aggregate they are spending more on the kinds of things that require lots of workers boosting employmentSpread over the entire economy this is a powerful trend America workforce today is roughly the same size as in 2019 Its composition is however very different There are 1m more workers in transport and warehousing reflecting the rise and rise of online shopping At the other end of the spectrum more than 1m workers have left the leisure and hospitality sectors over the past three years According to the National Restaurant Association a lobby group roughly two in three restaurants are understaffed Thus the slowdown in growth may lead to a smaller rise in unemployment than would otherwise have been expected Companies suffering from worker shortages have little fat to trimIn one sense this resilience is to be welcomed It implies that a recession if one arrives is likely to be mild Yet the Fed is determined to get inflation down and is focused on wage growth as a proxy for underlying price pressures Continued labour-market tightness therefore inclines the central bank towards a tougher longer bout of monetary tighteningThe Fed has already raised rates by a full three percentage points this year its steepest increase in four decades As turmoil sweeps through financial markets some economists have criticised the central bank for going too far too fast Some Fed officials also seem to be getting cold feet But their hawkish colleagues have the upper hand after a year of upside surprises The baseline expectation among investors is that the Fed will deliver at least another percentage point of rate increases before the end of the year That may well be a conservative guess Even after half a year of monetary tightening and a slowdown in growth the economy still suffers from a shortfall of supply and a surfeit of demandmost especially for workers In the face of such a mismatch the only direction for interest rates is up For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Global rate rises are happening on an unprecedented scale,The great tightening began in the spring of 2021 when a handful of central banks in Latin America and central Europe began putting up interest rates to calm their wobbling currencies and rein in inflation By the end of the year a few rich countries like Norway and South Korea had joined in the action Over the course of this year nearly every major economy has jammed on the brakes In the past five decades policy has never tilted so overwhelmingly towards rate rises see chartListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs the pace of tightening has increased growing numbers of economists have warned that this rapid and synchronous but largely unco-ordinated policymaking has the makings of trouble Maurice Obstfeld a former chief economist at the IMF recently argued that central banks’ failure to consider the global effects of their policies puts the world economy at risk of a “historic” slowdown While any given rate rise may be justifiable together they could have a greater effect than anticipatedRising inflation is a consequence of too much money chasing after a constrained supply of goods and services Rate-raising central banks set out to slow growth by dampening spending but in a globalised economy spending flows across borders When one central bank tries to quash demand it affects consumption of foreign goods as wellin effect helping other central banks to manage their inflation problems If such spillovers are not taken into account the global economy will slow by more than central banks had individually aimed to achieveFinancial flows work in parallel with this process A rate rise in one country may attract money from investors elsewhere causing the currency to strengthen This means a reduction in import costs which may help to cool domestic inflation But other economies then face higher import bills which exacerbates their inflation problems Unco-ordinated policy tightening can become its own sort of currency war in which each country works to shift the burden of inflation elsewhere with the net result being too much tighteningThe world biggest co-ordination problem however may be less one of every-central-bank-for-itself and more one in which a single dominant central bankAmerica Federal Reservecalls a tune which others must follow like it or not The dollar outsized sway in the global financial system grants it a powerful role in driving global financial cycles A recent paper from Mr Obstfeld and Haonan Zhou of Princeton University notes that monetary tightening in America is strongly associated with an appreciating dollar and a deterioration in a number of global economic and financial measures The Fed commitment to returning American inflation to 2% leaves it little room to accommodate other economies It may welcome rate rises elsewhere as a helpful contribution to America inflation fight even if countries begin falling like dominoes into recession Indeed the more spare capacity is created in other economies and the greater the downward pressure that places on prices globally the less unemployment may need to rise in America in order to achieve the Fed aims The world has become much more financially integrated since 1971 when John Connally then Treasury secretary said to representatives of the world other large economies that “the dollar is our currency but it your problem” As interest rates across the world spiral upward in an unco-ordinated manner the probability that any economy emerges from this experience unscathed sinks ever lower For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Economists now accept exchange-rate intervention can work,Milton friedman a Nobel-prizewinning economist was an early fan of floating currencies The case for flexible exchange rates he once pointed out is the same as the argument for daylight-saving time In theory people could start their summer days an hour earlier without any change in the clocks In practice it is easier to change the time than to change everyone habits By a similar logic whenever there is a shortfall in demand for a country goods and assets it is easier to let one price the exchange rate drop than it is to cut all of a country other prices instead Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFriedman made his analogy in the sedate 1950s when exchange rates seldom changed In today more volatile markets the clocks can be brutal The yen has fallen by 20% against the dollar this year the South Korean won by 17% and India rupee by 9% After Kwasi Kwarteng Britain chancellor unveiled fresh tax cuts on September 23rd the restless pound fell close to parity with the dollar It was as wrenching as an alarm in the middle of a dream In the face of such discomfort policymakers are often tempted to intervene in the currency markets Japan finance ministry has tried to prop up the yen for the first time since 1998 selling foreign currencies in exchange for its own The Reserve Bank of India has also acted selling more than $40bn since the beginning of July by some estimates South Korea finance minister has said the authorities will review “contingency plans” to stop the won falling so fast Some economists have begun to look up how much Britain has stashed away in its foreign-exchange reserves Not a lot Friedman thought currency defences were either unnecessary or impossible If the shortfall in demand was large and lasting intervention would only delay the inevitable since the country would run out of foreign-exchange reserves If the shortfall was small and fleeting intervention was unnecessary Instead of buying a temporarily cheapened currency the government could rely on speculators to do the job since they would profit whenever the currency regained its footing Intervention was necessary only if the government was better at spotting a temporary misalignment than financial speculators whose livelihoods depended on it Early studies of intervention reinforced this scepticism In 1982 the G7 commissioned a report which concluded that currency intervention had little durable effect There was unusual consensus among economists that currency intervention was not an “effective or lasting” instrument as Kathryn Dominguez of the University of Michigan and Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard later pointed outBut more recent work has overturned this consensus thanks both to theoretical and empirical advances The longer-term impact of intervention can be hard to discern because central banks do not step into the currency markets at random They sell foreign reserves when the currency is weakening and buy when it is under pressure to strengthen And so a naive look at the data might suggest that intervention backfires: reserve sales are associated with a weaker currency just as firefighters are associated with fires One response is to look at currency interventions that are bigger or smaller than would be expected If a blaze attracts more firefighters than it would normally warrant the extra firefighters will probably be associated with a shorter better contained conflagration That is one of several approaches taken by Andrew Filardo of the Hoover Institution as well as Gaston Gelos and Thomas McGregor of the IMF in a paper published in June They concluded that if a currency is undervalued by 10% sales of foreign-exchange reserves worth about 01% of GDP can strengthen it by more than 4% If the authorities intervene systematically over several quarters they get additional bang for their buck The impact is also greater in shallow financial markets These effects are not limited to the minutes or days after an intervention They show up even in quarterly data But the impact is not permanent either Intervention can narrow the kind of misalignments that occur over a one- to four-year spanit does not seem to influence longer-term swings in the currency Why does intervention work? One reason is that speculators are not as reliable as Friedman assumed The outfits that bet on currencies have a limited capacity to bear risk These limits tighten in times of stress when financial institutions pull in their horns reducing the size of bets In such circumstances national authorities may be better placed to correct misalignments even if they are no better at spotting themIntervention may also work by serving as a signal of policymakers’ resolve The government should after all know better than speculators what the government intends to do It may be determined to pursue policies consistent with a stronger currency But it may struggle to convince sceptical investors Through currency intervention it can put its foreign money where its mouth is Of the 18 central banks from emerging economies surveyed by the Bank of International Settlements in 2018 nearly three-quarters identified signalling as “often or sometimes important”The clock is tickingThese results offer little encouragement to Japan or Britain the two big economies suffering the steepest drop in their exchange rates this year The Bank of Japan is still committed to capping its government bond yields however high yields rise in other parts of the world That stance whatever its virtues is hardly consistent with a strong yen And given the size of Britain current-account deficit and the pace of its inflation the diminished pound is not obviously weaker than it should be Currency intervention can serve as a signal of tighter policies It cannot substitute for themTo support their currency Britain authorities must either raise interest rates rather faster than planned or reassert budgetary discipline Mr Kwarteng has said he will clarify his medium-term fiscal plans on November 23rd If he is to save the pound he may need to bring forward his fiscal clock Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:China rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy Sep 22ndRicher societies mean fewer babies Right?

 Sep 29th 2022,Japan monetary policymakers are sticking to their guns,There have been few months in monetary history as consequential as this September Countries everywhere have tightened the screws on borrowers to smother inflation But there has been a notable holdout The Bank of Japan boj the pioneer of modern zero-interest rate and bond-buying operations is standing firm Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe country has struggled with low inflation and even deflation for decades Its monetary policy has been designed to make financing conditions for companies and households as easy as possible in an effort to get them to spend In 2016 the boj adopted a policy of yield-curve control which caps 10-year government bond yields at around 0% This becomes more difficult when the rest of the world is raising interest rates since the growing spread leads to a weaker currency as investors seek stronger returns elsewhereOn September 22nd Kuroda Haruhiko the boj governor reiterated that the bank would hold rates down This statement familiar to BOJ-watchers was followed by something much rarer The value of the yen fell to its lowest in more than 20 years leading the Japanese government to intervene in currency markets for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in 1998The BOJ refusal to budge and the government intervention in currency markets reflect stark differences between Japan and the rest of the rich world In contrast to America and Europe Japan economy has still not returned to pre-pandemic output Japanese consumer prices rose by 28% year on year in August marginally above the BOJ 2% target But that figure may overstate the amount of underlying price pressure Excluding fresh food and energy costs prices were up just 16% year-on-year against an average of 72% across the oecd club of mostly rich countriesThe BOJ has another reason to sit on its hands Unlike most central banks which focus on very short-term interest rates Japan yield-curve control necessitates direct intervention in the market through buying and selling long-dated bonds It also relies on the widespread belief that the central bank will intervene to maintain the levels it is targeting which stops traders from buying or selling Japanese government bonds outside the tight band the BOJ sets Other central banks can simply retrace their steps and cut interest rates if required; once abandoned yield-curve control would be difficult to resume The fall in the currency makes imports more expensive in yen: the country import bill rose by 50% in August year on year Kishida Fumio the prime minister has announced support including a 50000 yen $350 handout for poor families Kataoka Goushi an economist until recently on the BOJ policy board reckons more co-ordination between monetary and fiscal policy will be needed to soften the impact of the weak yen and to reflate Japan economy That could take the form of household tax cuts now or business-investment incentives in the long runOutside Japan there may be unexpected consequences to the weak yen The country is the world largest foreign creditor Its net international investment positionoverseas assets held by Japanese owners minus Japanese assets held by overseas ownersruns to $35trn far north of China $19trn This huge pile is the result of decades of high savingsA weaker currency makes foreign assets worth more when measured in yen But the gyrating currency also means volatility making many owners nervous And the gap in interest rates between Japan and elsewhere makes hedging overseas investments exorbitantly expensive Perhaps as a result investors have sold 13trn yen in foreign securities so far this year according to the finance ministry the most since at least 2005 Thus the falling yen is not only an issue for Japan For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 29th 2022,Financial markets are in chaos What next for the real economy?,The federal reserve began raising interest rates to battle inflation in America a full six months ago But its determination to crush surging prices whatever the cost to the economy is only now starting to sink in The central bank latest policy meeting which ended on September 21st has been followed by dramatic moves in financial markets across the world The economic consequences will be a little slower in coming but no weaker for it Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAfter the meeting Jerome Powell the Fed chairman said the central bank was “strongly resolved” to bring down inflation currently at 83% to its target of 2% That resolve sent government-bond yields surging and stockmarkets tumbling Yields on ten-year Treasuries rose by nearly half a percentage point On September 28th they spiked above 4% for the first time since just after the global financial crisis before falling a little Higher rates in America have turbocharged the dollar The dxy an index of the greenback against half a dozen major currencies has risen by nearly 18% this year and is now at its highest in more than two decades The flip side of dollar strength has been drama elsewhere In Britain sterling took a breathtaking dive aided by the government decision to unveil the country largest tax cuts since the 1970s Short-term interest rates rose just as spectacularly Meanwhile the euro reached its lowest point against the greenback in two decades on September 26th Expectations of rate rises by the European Central Bank as it fights the resulting increase in imported inflation sent bond yields in the euro area rising too In heavily indebted Italy yields on ten-year sovereign bonds are not far off a worrying 5% Jolting currency movements have led to a spate of interventions In Japan where the central bank is fighting an increasingly lonely battle to keep interest rates low the government intervened to prop up the yen for the first time since the Asian financial crisis in 1998; India central bank has also intervened to support the rupee China central bank is requiring banks to post reserves when selling foreign-exchange derivatives contracts making it harder to bet against the yuan The great unknown is the impact of these ructions on a financial system that has changed significantly since the crisis of 2007-09 Financiers and policymakers alike agree that banks are far safer But weird dysfunctions in less-scrutinised corners of the system cannot be ruled out One illustration of this came soon after Britain gilt markets were battered by the “mini-budget” Pension funds that had used derivatives to protect themselves against interest-rate risk found themselves pressed to raise cash to meet collateral requirements They raised that money by fire-selling long-dated gilts setting off a vicious cycle of sales and higher yields On September 28th the Bank of England stepped in saying it would purchase long-dated gilts to restore order Another worry stems from the roughly $24trn in private-market assets which have ballooned over the past decade So far this year these have been marked down by only 11% reckon analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank far less than the 20% or so decline in listed stocks and bonds Should markdowns catch up with the public markets the owners of these assets will take bigger losses It is unclear precisely who is on the hook The impact on the world economy by contrast is clearerand it is not good news Thanks to a natural-gas crisis in Europe and a housing slowdown in China its prospects were already looking dicey In forecasts published on September 26th the oecd a club of mostly rich countries said that global gdp would rise by just 3% this year down from the 45% it had expected in December Commodity prices a barometer of the state of the global economy have fallen in recent months The price of a barrel of Brent crude is now in the region of $83-88 levels not seen since Russia invaded Ukraine The prices of copper and other industrial metals are also downThe latest market volatility will add to the pain Rising government-bond yields are translating into higher borrowing costs for households and companies In America the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to 69% the highest since the financial crisis In Britain lenders briefly paused some new mortgage lending owing to volatile interest rates Yields on riskier high-yield or “junk” corporate bonds have more than doubled in America and the euro area to 94% and 78% respectivelyEurope seems set to suffer the most The energy crisis has already cast a long pall with economists pencilling in two to three quarters of negative gdp growth in the euro zone Annual inflation is already above 9% and a weaker euro will further push up the cost of imported goods The European Central Bank eager to shore up its inflation-fighting credibility has signalled that it intends to raise rates twice this year in order to keep inflation expectations in check Doing so will only deepen the recession on the continent As for America? The world largest economy has experienced an enviable boom in recent years buoyed by fiscal largesse during the covid-19 pandemic Rising rates are making a dent in the property market the most interest-sensitive part of the economy According to the latest Case-Shiller index published on September 27th house prices fell by 03% in July compared with the previous month the biggest such decline in a decadeFor now though there is little sign of a wider slowdown in America Underlying inflation at an annual rate of 63% is still considerably higher than the Fed would like In contrast to the housing market inflation tends takes a while to react to higher interest rates And until it comes down there will be no relief from rate rises Mr Powell has said he will be looking for “compelling evidence that inflation is moving down” The rest of the world will be watching just as anxiously For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 25th 2022,The world enters a new era: Bail-outs for everyone!,The winter of 1973-74 was grim and in similar ways to today In response to geopolitical strife energy prices went through the roof Across Europe the price of natural gas more than doubled and in places there were even bigger increases in heating oil The price of crude oil more than tripled This fed an inflationary surge across the rich world cutting real incomes There was no end in sightListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt the height of the crisis Willy Brandt West Germany chancellor summed up the official response in many countries “We’ll have to get dressed a little more warmly this winter” he said “and maybe the next two or three winters But we aren’t going to starve” His government like others focused on efforts to cut fuel consumptionby imposing speed limits telling people not to drive on Sundays and asking factories to turn down furnaces Sweden and the Netherlands introduced petrol rationing; Italy imposed a curfew in bars and restaurants Few governments doled out money In 1973 the real value of Britain benefits bill barely budged Today governments have introduced some measures to cut consumption But mainly they have turned on the fiscal taps Britain has allocated funding worth 65% of gdp in the next year to shield households and firms from higher energy bills more than it spent on its furlough scheme and support for the self-employed in 2020-21 Germany and France are offering handouts and subsidies worth about 3% of gdp European governments are nationalising chunks of their energy sectors America has spent too if on a smaller scale State governors are doling out “gas cards” and suspending fuel taxes to help people refill Imagine the reaction today if a country leader only followed Brandt approach and told people to put on an extra layerThe shift in energy policy hints at a more profound change in how governments govern Politicians have long sought to provide safety nets or stimulus in bad times But over the past 15 years they have become far more willing to shore up vast swathes of the economy When industries companies or people get into trouble fiscal help is never far away Gains are privatised but a growing share of losses or even potential losses are socialised To appreciate this role for the state discard much of the conventional wisdom which says that in the “neoliberal” era governments have let free markets run riot Instead this is an era of “bail-outs for everyone”Three events have shaped the new era First is the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In this period America spent 35% of gdp on crisis-related bail-outs including capital infusions for banks and mortgage lenders according to Deborah Lucas of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The justification for the interventions was that doing nothing would have proved far costlier If the banking system had collapsed so would the rest of the economy When covid-19 arrived bail-outs moved from the financial economy to the real one “Everybody said we bailed out the banks and we didn’t look after the people who really suffered” said Boris Johnson then Britain prime minister This time would be different During lockdowns governments handed out trillions of dollars of support guaranteed vast amounts of corporate lending and banned evictions and bankruptcies Unlike in previous crises rates of poverty hunger and destitution did not rise and in some places fell Across the rich world disposable incomes rose The third event is the surge in energy prices that has followed Russia war in Ukraine The challenge facing Europe where the consumer price of energy has already risen by 45% since last year has convinced many politicians that once again there is no option but massive state intervention Europe energy bills will rise by about €2trn relative to 2021 according to analysis by Goldman Sachs a bank Thanks to hastily patched together measures governments will subsidise much of this The cumulative effect of three once-in-a-generation crises in quick succession has been a change in the terms of political debate Politicians have set new expectations of what the state can and should do This is visible in the smaller bail-outs guarantees and rescues that have mushroomed since the start of the 2010s The Italian government for instance has set up schemes to deal with banks’ non-performing loans in an attempt to get the private financial sector to lend again The British government has offered banks vast guarantees to get them to offer bigger mortgages The value of bank deposits insured by America government has risen by 40% in the past five yearsRecently things have gone into overdrive In August President Joe Biden announced that he would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out Americans holding student-loan debt Around the same time he expanded loan guarantees for clean energy Australia and New Zealand have offered citizens cost-of-living payments to deal with high inflation Poland has introduced a moratorium on mortgage debt It is only a matter of time before the next intervention comes along What if Intel a tech firm crucial to Mr Biden domestic semiconductor drive begins to struggle? What if in a year time Europe energy prices remain sky-high? The true size of the bail-out state is hard to calculate in part by design Governments generally do not include so-called “contingent liabilities” such as guaranteed loans and implicit backstops in fiscal figures This allows them to support the economy while keeping reported debt down Conventional measures of America public debt do not for instance include the promises and obligations that the state has made to groups ranging from the financial industry to airports to pensioners The truth starts to become clearer if you dig into government balance-sheets It turns out for instance that British ministers have promised to help a bewildering number of projects The British state is responsible for clearing up the Channel Tunnel if it falls into disuse It has made commitments to support pension liabilities of some individual pension schemes if deficits need to be funded It may cover reinsurers of commercial and industrial property in the event of a big terrorist attack Adapting work by James Hamilton at the University of California San Diego we have attempted to calculate the total implicit liabilities of the American federal governmentin effect how much it has promised to pay if things go wrong plus commitments for which it has not fully accounted In addition to reported public debt we add off-balance-sheet obligations including guarantees on people bank deposits health-care payouts and mortgage guarantees for the first time ever the federal government recently became the guarantor or source of funding for more than half of American mortgages We find that the state is on the hook for liabilities worth more than six times the country gdp and that these liabilities have in recent years grown much faster than the country output see chart 1 Other data also point to a growing bail-out state Rich-world government spending on subsidies and transfers such as welfare benefits has grown inexorably as politicians help companies that are struggling and compensate households who they deem to have had a raw deal see chart 2 In Britain this spending has not been so high since the data began in 1948 America is known as a place with a meagre welfare statea perception that no longer fits reality In 1979 the bottom fifth of American earners received means-tested transfers worth 32% of their pre-tax income according to the Congressional Budget Office By 2018 the figure was 68% Governments are quicker to respond to emergencies too Evidence from Deutsche Bank shows that the size of financial-sector bail-outs has grown We examined public-spending data from Britain looking at whether actual spending by government departments came in higher or lower than originally budgeted This gives a sense of how frequently and how decisively the government responds to emergencies Mid-year bail-outs used to be rarethey no longer are see chart 3 A recent paper by Dan Gabriel Anghel of the Bucharest University of Economic Studies and colleagues shows that governments’ contingent liabilities are crystallising into actual payouts more often than used to the case In the 1990s European governments launched about two rescue operations a year In 2019 they launched ten No one likes to see a business go bust or someone fall into destitution The fact that this happens less frequently is on its own terms welcome Another benefit of the bail-out state is that people and businesses no longer need to spend quite as much on insurance since they know the state will step in In America total spending on insurance premiums peaked in the early 2000s at around 8% of gdp but has now fallen to under 6% This represents an enormous savingThere are downsides however aside from the potentially monumental fiscal costs As Friedrich Hayek an economist pointed out while a given interventiona bank bail-out saymay be justifiable in its own right lots of interventions together may strangle an economy Capitalism produces innovations and higher incomes through the process of creative destruction Things that do not work stop and things that work better start An economywide safety-net slows this down For now governments are unlikely to change course So long as they are not directed at banks bail-outs tend to be popular And with the possible exception of Britain investors seem not as yet to have fully digested the fiscal risks implicit in this new strategy When the next recession hits as it may well soon expect another round of furlough schemes additional benefits and stimulus cheques When the next industry fails expect a big rescue package We are all bankers now For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 22nd 2022,Why Wall Street is snapping up family homes,Housing is the world biggest asset class But until recently renting out family homes was a mom-and-pop cottage business seen as uninvestable by Wall Street When Blackstone a private-equity giant floated the idea of creating vast portfolios of homes after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 banks refused to lend to it The firm ran the idea by Sam Zell a property mogul who sold Blackstone his $39bn office empire before the financial crisis “No way” he retorted For an investor routinely splurging on hotel chains and swanky office towers the buy-to-let business seemed like small fry by comparison Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBlackstone went ahead despite Mr Zell advice A decade on from the first purchase in Phoenix Arizonaan outlay worth $100000the experiment has morphed into an institutional-grade asset class Last year interest in the sector reached fever pitch According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting a research firm big investors committed at least $45bn to buying single-family homes in America up from $3bn the year before Even as housing markets cool investment is pouring in with firms including Goldman Sachs and kkr following in Blackstone footstepsIt is easy to see why Between 2016 and 2021 annual returns from family rentals of 21% have outperformed those of housing for old folk 7% offices 5% shopping malls -1% and even apartments 12% according to Green Street another research firm Unlike mom-and-pop investors who tend to own no more than a handful of homes the biggest institutions hold tens of thousands which are offered renovated and have around-the-clock maintenance Invitation Homes America largest family landlord says it spends an average of $39000 fixing up each one kitting them out with new flooring upgraded plumbing and the latest tech such as video doorbells and smart locksThese goodies are attracting richer tenants Between 2010 and 2018 those with incomes of above $75000 accounted for three-quarters of the growth in renters Covid-19 accelerated this as bidding wars forced high-earners to rent Invitation Homes says its residents now have an annual household income of above $131000 nearly twice the country medianThere is plenty of room for further expansion In America real-estate investment trusts reits own just 1% of single-family rentals compared with 5-10% of offices and warehouses 15% of housing for old people and 50% of shopping malls Big investors are also starting to build more rather than just buying up existing stock Last year they built a record 7705 family units up from an average of 5500 in 2015-20 By 2030 MetLife Investment Management an asset manager expects institutions to have amassed 76m homes more than two-fifths of all family rentalsThe trend has also spread to Europe Investors such as Aviva and Legal & General are building thousands of rental homes across Britain which now has more than 73000 “build to rent” properties Institutional investors are also gobbling up property in Germany Ireland the Netherlands and the Nordic markets which have higher shares of renters than other rich countriesWhat behind the explosive growth? One explanation is that ageing millennials offer a growing market As they approach their late 30s and early 40sa sweet spot for landlordsmany want better schools for their children or space for pets or finally have enough money to dump their housemates In America population growth in this age category will nearly double over the next five years Ageing baby-boomers are also renting in higher numbers In England the proportion of those aged 55 to 64 who are renting has almost doubled since 2011Declining housing affordability helps Those unable to buy homes have little choice but to rent meaning landlords are confident of their ability to find and keep new tenants especially for entry-level homes In America at least 420000 starter homes were built each year in the 1970s Last year just 93000 were Thus rents continue to climb Across the country those for family homes rose by more than 13% in June compared with a year earlier In Orlando they were up by 23% In Miami by more than a third Despite rising rents Wall Street landlords are not immune to economic uncertainty Inflation means the cost of renovating and maintaining homes is rising Invitation Homes says the amount it spent on these things rose by nearly 8% in the second quarter of this year Construction costs have also risen posing risk for investors building from scratch Prices for building materials including concrete lumber and steel have surged by 38% since the start of 2020 Interest-rate rises are another worry; as the market softens investors are taking a more cautious approach Home Partners of America owned by Blackstone announced in August that it would pause home purchases in 38 cities markets that represent 5% of its activity Economic cycles are inevitable Rents are unlikely to continue to climb at a record pace Yet history suggests that residential rents are more resilient than those from other property types especially in periods when supply is tight From 1974 to 1985 another period of high inflation rents actually increased by 7-12% a year notes Jay Parsons an economist at RealPage a data firm Even as homebuyer demand crashed during the global financial crisis demand from residential tenants did not waver Although the housing splurge of institutional investors may calm a bit it is unlikely to cease Correction September 30th 2022: An earlier version of this article said that the value of American family rental homes owned by institutional investors is $47trn In fact that is the value of all the country family rental homes Sorry 
 Sep 22nd 2022,Peter Thiel says California suffers from a “tech curse” Is he right?,Speaking recently at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami Peter Thiel an investor and intellectual made a provocative argument He suggested that California suffers from a “tech curse”: a play on the “resource curse” the notion that countries with abundant natural resources often have weak economies and corrupt political systems If data is the new oil then California is the new Saudi Arabiaeven he said if things aren’t quite “as bad as Equatorial Guinea” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Thiel made the Equatorial Guinea comparison with tongue firmly in cheek but he was deadly serious about the tech-curse theory At first glance it seems plausible California tech industry has in recent years produced astonishing wealth The state is also in many ways dysfunctional Parts of downtown San Francisco resemble an open-air drug den Many of the state public schools seem keener on talking about social justice than teaching children Each year one in every 100 Californians on net leaves for another state Mr Thiel thinks that California poverty and prosperity are two sides of the same coin with state and local governments providing the link Public-sector employees draw on tech enormous tax revenues to overpay themselves and do no work he says The state tech moguls in effect buy off politicians ensuring for example that they enact super-restrictive planning regulations to keep house prices high It is in vogue to criticise both California and tech: doing both at the same time left the audience in raptures There is also a grain of truth to what Mr Thiel says But there are two big problems with his theory Take the benefits offered by California tech industry first Tech has in fact turned the state into a growth superstar not a laggard In the past five years California state-level gdp has grown by 18% the fourth-fastest rate in the country and a better performance than either Florida or Texas see chart Even subtracting tech California growth was above average according to our calculations Less fashionable industries such as chemicals manufacturing have also done well in recent years Many of the proceeds of this growth have gone on enormous mansions in Atherton and Los Altos but they have also trickled down to a greater extent than Mr Thiel appreciates Just over a decade ago the median Californian household had an income 7% higher than the median American one Now their income is 15% higher The unemployment rate relative to the national average has fallen So has poverty And there is little to suggest that the decline in joblessness or poverty is caused by poor people leaving the stateMr Thiel also overstates tech costs It is true that some of California politicians behave with nearly as much impunity as the Saudi elite Yet anyone with a passing knowledge of Californian history knows that dirty dealing in politics long predates tech San Francisco politics today is tame in comparison with the 1970s It is similarly hard to blame tech for California housing market The ratio of California average house price to America is much lower than in the mid-2000s Meanwhile California anti-building rules the cause of sky-high prices emerged with the environmentalist movement of the 1970s not Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk There is a lot to dislike about Big Tech but it is not as malign as Mr Thiel believes For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The obvious explanation is a once-in-a-generation surge in inflation Across the oecd club of mostly rich countries prices are rising by about 10% a year Economists dislike inflation; the general public despises it Many people think that price-gouging firms are taking them for fools Yet high inflation is not a sufficient explanation for the gloominess Our analysis finds that American consumer sentiment is about a third lower than you would expect given the rate of inflation Behavioural economics offers three other potential explanations The first is to do with expectations In 2020 many pundits speculated that once covid-19 was beaten the world would enter the “roaring twenties” So far that hasn’t happened Productivity growth remains low; no one owns a flying car How could you not be disappointed? The second relates to the comedown from the stimulus bonanza In 2020-21 rich-world governments doled out trillions of dollars to households boosting disposable incomes by an unusually large amount This year governments have largely stopped the handouts Average disposable incomes are now falling even without accounting for inflation Nobody likes that The third relates to the stimulus bonanza itself A new working paper by Ania Jaroszewicz of Harvard University and colleagues finds tentative evidence that people who get modest cash payments of up to $2000the sort of amounts given out during the pandemicactually become unhappier These payments are not big enough to be life-changing and may simply highlight what recipients are unable to afford The fiscal response to covid it seems has a sting in its tail All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 22nd 2022,How to rebrand stockmarket indices,Good morning and thank you for the invitation to Hieroglyph Capital Partners You asked us to demonstrate our marketing skills by choosing an aspect of your branding to review Now this may be eccentric but we’ve picked your tracker funds Hieroglyph green-investment programme its philanthropic work or its industry-leading quantitative analysts are all more obvious candidates for our attention Tracker funds are dull and deliberately so: they’re just algorithms that let your investors replicate the performance of stockmarket indices as cheaply as possible Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKExcept for the choice of index any one is just like all the others But a nondescript product doesn’t preclude a strong brandit demands one Think of airlines Or perfume Or lager More importantly the boring reasons for preferring passive funds to actively managed ones are getting harder to sell Investors are happy to buy a low-cost fund that indiscriminately tracks the market return when everything is heading in the right direction But even if they know that virtually no active manager beats the market over the long-term it gets harder to remember this when they’re losing money This year a lot of them have lost a lot They’re starting to wonder if a good stockpicker could have sheltered them from the worst of itConvince investors to associate a fund with a compelling brand rather than just its fact sheet and Key Investor Document and you stand a better chance of retaining them A successful brand has three components It is distinct from its peers and it is relevant to your clients and their investment goals Crucially it also has “proof points” or evidence that it delivers on its promises Which brings us to our three case studies: Hieroglyph s&p 500 fund tracking the index of large American stocks; the Nikkei 225 fund tracking Japanese firms; and the ftse 100 fund tracking the largest hundred companies listed in LondonThe s&p 500 fund already stands out Investors know that it is weighted heavily towards tech firms and that in Apple Amazon and Alphabet it contains the biggest corporate victors of the past few decades That lets them think of it as both a safe playbetting on established winnersand as a punt on the future But its relevance and proof points are looking shaky Investors like the idea of risk-taking innovative firms but only when their share prices are going up So far this year the s&p 500 is down 20% That not in line with anyone investment goalsThe key is to play down the exciting tech-driven disruptive side of the s&p 500 Call it the “All American Fund” instead The index captures four-fifths of America stockmarket value after all That makes it a proxy for the world biggest economy one which is well-placed to weather a recession Investors will be looking for reassurance if the market keeps falling Give it to themThere is another fund that would benefit from a similar approach Investors still associate Japanese stocks with deflation weak corporate governance and the bubble of the 1980s But today inflation of just 3% makes Japan a safer bet than most economies A weak yen ought to be good for its exporters too You could do worse than dusting off your Nikkei 225 fund and naming it the “Safe Haven Fund” The ftse 100 fund is a thornier problem Again it stands out The absence of tech firms and preponderance of “old economy” stocksenergy mining and banksis firmly lodged in investors’ minds At the start of this year this seemed like a good thing Tech looked frothy; soaring commodity prices and rising interest rates were going to help the dinosaurs roar If Britain economy and currency were shaky no matter: most of the ftse earnings come from countries outside BritainIt hasn’t worked out Measured in dollars the ftse 100 has fallen by 20% this year To have dropped by the same as the s&p 500 after a decade of radically underperforming it makes investors question whether London flagship index is good for anything at all One answer is supposed to be its dividend yield but at 37% that barely any better than Treasuries these daysRather than rebranding we’d advise taking this fund out of the spotlight A brand can’t deliver unless the product can As for relevance the value of the entire index is less than that of Apple Stop marketing it to your clients and you send them a message about Hieroglyph own brand: that you don’t try to sell investors things they don’t needRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why investors should forget about delayed gratification Sep 15thEmerging-market stocks are struggling in an intangible world Sep 8thWhy investors are reaching for the astrology of finance Sep 1stFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 21st 2022,A global manufacturing slowdown suggests worse is to come,“Is a global recession imminent?” asks a new report by the World Bank The answerthat one very well might bewill not be a surprise to manufacturers In August global manufacturing output shrank relative to the month before and new orders fell for the second month in a row according to JPMorgan Chase a bank As economic woes mount worse could be ahead for factories and the broader economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLast year industry enjoyed an epic boom Consumers bolstered by generous covid-19 relief splashed out on goods and the easing of lockdowns allowed factories to make up lost ground The value of global manufacturing output leapt to more than $16trn representing the highest share of gdp in nearly two decades Roaring industry powered a banner year for the world economy with overall global output rising by 61% the fastest pace on record despite supply-chain problems A softening of demand was inevitable as life became normal and spending shifted back from goods to services But even service-sector activity looks disappointing of late and manufacturing troubles reflect much bigger shocks The most serious is the energy-price crunch caused by Russia war in Ukraine Industrial production in the euro zone fell by 24% in July against the year before Firms have had to idle plants in the face of energy costs which render production uneconomicala cold winter would bring even more pain The beleaguered Chinese economy is also a problem Manufacturers struggling with “zero-covid” policies and a property-market bust were hit by an additional shock over the summer as intense drought impeded shipping and dealt a blow to hydropower Data from Caixin a business publication show that Chinese manufacturing sales shrank in August compared with the previous month The performance of economies which typically export lots of goods and components to China also spells trouble South Korean production swooned over the summer for instance as its exports to China tumbled The drag from high energy costs and a limping Chinese economy has been reinforced by tightening monetary policy Surging demand for goods over the past two years overtaxed the capacity of factories ships and ports pushing inflation up High prices have proven remarkably persistentthanks in part to the shock of the war in Ukraineso central banks are taking aggressive action Such synchronous tightening has occurred rarely over the past half century notes the World Bank and resembles the positioning which triggered a global recession in 1982 For now manufacturers in India and South-East Asia have resisted global headwinds That may reflect efforts to diversify supply chains away from China During the first seven months of 2022 China exports of goods to America were up by 18% compared with the year before Exports from India were up by 30% however while those from Vietnam were up by 33% Indonesia by 41% and Bangladesh by 50% Yet their fortunes are ultimately roped to the world economy as a whole; if it continues to weaken even relatively insulated places will find it difficult to avoid a slump A global recession is not a foregone conclusion Manufacturing suffered in 2015-16 and in 2019 and in both cases the economy avoided a downturn But in these periods policy changed dramatically to prevent weakening growth from snowballing In the middle of the decade the Federal Reserve raised rates far more slowly than it had led markets to expectand China opened a fire hose of stimulus In 2019 the Fed pivoted to rate cuts even as President Donald Trump tax plan swelled American deficits boosting the world economy There is little immediate hope for similar reversals China is wedded to its zero-covid policies for now meaning new stimulus would do little to boost growth Recently Fed officials have told markets they should expect American interest rates to rise higher and stay there for longereven if this pushes the economy towards recession see next story Indeed so long as American consumer spending remains robust the Fed will probably feel that its inflation-fighting work is unfinished The safe bet is that conditions will get worse before they get better But how much worse? The World Bank presents three scenarios for next year The baseline is one consistent with the current consensus outlook for growth of about 15% per person but which is probably not consistent with central banks’ desired fall in inflationand which is thus almost certainly too optimistic In a second “sharp downturn” scenario central banks have to work harder to arrest inflation but still fail to restore price stability and growth decelerates to 08% per person The third is one in which significant synchronous monetary tightening induces a recession such that global output shrinks by about 04% per person Either of the latter scenarios would be bitter for countries still recovering from the covid downturn Debt loads around the world remain alarmingly high and many countries’ economies lag below their pre-pandemic trendline Their leaders will be watching the slowdown in global manufacturing with considerable trepidation For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 20th 2022,China rulers seem resigned to a slowing economy,In 2011 the American Economic Review published an influential article entitled “Growing like China” Its authors including Zheng Song of the Chinese University of Hong Kong tried to explain the country distinctive pace and pattern of development The title was as well received as the argument echoed in a variety of papers such as “Innovating like China” “Investing like China” and “Internationalising like China”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis year however the country is not growing like China at all Thanks to its deep property slump and the government “zero-covid” policy which entails lockdowns in response to every outbreak of the virus the economy is now forecast to grow by less than 3% in 2022 according to banks such as Nomura Morgan Stanley and ubs That is far below the official target of 55% China currency is also weakening On September 16th it took more than seven yuan to buy a dollar for the first time since July 2020 A gap has opened up between the gdp path envisaged for China at the start of this year and the grimmer one that now seems probable China gdp in 2023 could be more than $2trn below the level forecast in January reckons Goldman Sachs another bankIt is not like China to settle for such underperformance In the past economists have marvelled at its ability to stimulate spending when necessary so as to meet its growth targets and adequately employ its busy workforce and workshops Even after the global financial crisis in 2008 China gdp quickly caught up to where it would have been had the crisis never happened Impressed by this result Yi Wen of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis and Jing Wu of Tsinghua University wrote another “like China” paper entitled “Withstanding the Great Recession like China”The country resilience the authors argued rested on the unconventional bust-busting tools that it had at its disposal China like other countries eased monetary policy when the global financial crisis struck But in other countries companies and consumers remained reluctant to borrow even at rock-bottom interest rates As a result monetary easing did not translate into a big expansion of credit In China by contrast state-owned enterprises and local-government financing vehicles which invest in infrastructure and other civic projects borrowed eagerly from China banks at the government behest Other countries pushed on a string China had other strings to pull Why then is China not withstanding this year slowdown as it did in the past? Its fiscal deficit broadly defined to include off-budget borrowing will increase this year But only by about 3% of gdp according to Goldman Sachs The fiscal swing was more like 4% of gdp in the two years from 2008 to 2010 And it was even larger in response to China property slowdown in 2015 Tax breaks for firms account for a big share of this year stimulus compared with the negligible role they played in 2008-09 That could be more efficient if companies know better than the government how to spend the money But it may be less effective if firms choose not to spend it at allLocal governments and their financing vehicles which led the stimulus efforts in 2008 are not now so bold The property slump has hurt land sales which accounted for about a third of their revenues last year And the signs of financial strain are not confined to the ledger books To plug budgetary holes 80 out of 111 cities tracked by Southern Weekly a mainland newspaper increased the amount they collected in fines last year Yulin a city in Shaanxi province imposed a fine of 66000 yuan $9500 on a grocer for selling 25kg of subpar celery An indebted state-owned bus company in Lanzhou the capital of Gansu province floated an ingenious idea to pay the overdue salaries of some of its staff Unable to apply for additional loans itself it suggested the employees themselves take out loans which the company pledged to repayThe lack of avid borrowers is blunting China monetary policy much as it did in other big economies after the global financial crisis China has cut a variety of interest rates including its first reduction in the benchmark deposit rate since 2015 Yet faster growth in the money supply has not so far translated into an equivalent acceleration of credit In principle the central government could do more itself to revive growth It could increase spending or help bridge the financial gaps suffered by lower levels of government It has allowed local authorities to issue another 500bn yuan of “special bonds” which are supposed to be repaid with revenues from the infrastructure projects they finance But that is both less than many analysts expected and less than requiredChina leaders may be seeking to avoid the past mistakes even if it means also forgoing the past successes Xi Jinping China president and Li Keqiang its prime minister came into office in 2013 several years after the financial crash when the unwelcome after-effects of China stimulus efforts were keenly felt Torrential spending by the many arms of the state left behind excess capacity a skewed pattern of production and heavy debts Mr Li has repeatedly promised not to resort to “flood-like” stimulus a veiled reference to the past From hero to zeroThere is a simpler explanation for the change of approach too Mr Xi has become deeply invested in maintaining a “zero-covid” regime which he portrays as proof of China superior social model Local governments are under pressure to keep a lid on infections; a preoccupation that would distract them from an all-out effort to boost public investment even if the financing were available In addition the ever-present threat of lockdowns has crushed the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs Thus any additional government outlays would be less effective in stimulating private spending Other countries may outpace the country economy this year But no one fights covid-19 like China Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Richer societies mean fewer babies Right?

 Sep 15th 2022,Against expectations covid-19 retirees are returning to work,On september 11th Tom Brady marked his “unretirement” from America National Football League guiding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a decisive win over the Dallas Cowboys in their first game of the season Mr Brady probably the greatest quarterback in history had earlier this year announced that he was retiring only to change his mind a few weeks later The 45-year-old athlete is it seems not the only one who cannot bring himself to give up the grind Across the rich world old folk are flocking back to workListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is quite a turnaround When the covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020 many people already close to retirement brought the date forward Using data from a variety of sources we estimate that the rich world labour-force participation rate for people aged 65 and over crashed that spring see chart This represented a relatively larger decline than for people of working age Like everybody else some oldies were fired as demand dried up In addition though they also faced higher risks of becoming seriously ill or dying if they caught covid meaning many no longer wanted to work Economists had assumed based on historical experience that pandemic retirees would never come back Employers often unfairly turn their noses up at older job applicants; for their part older folk can find the idea of learning the ropes at a new place daunting Indeed two years on many appear to have followed the example of Rob Gronkowski Mr Brady former partner in crime hanging up their cleats for good But a surprising number have followed the path of Mr Brady There are probably more over-65s in the rich world labour force today than there were in 2019 Old-age participation is lower than it would have been without the pandemic But we estimate that the number of pandemic-induced retirees has fallen by 20-40% from its peak In Britain and South Korea old-age activity is higher today than it was in 2019 Other data back up the idea of a wave of unretirements Statistics from Europe suggest that as early as the end of 2020 an unusually large share of people aged 55 to 74 were moving from economic inactivity to employment According to our analysis of official microdata in the second quarter of this year some 75000 Britons in paid work said that they had been retired the year before much higher than the pre-pandemic norm It is a similar story in America Nick Bunker of Indeed a jobs site finds that the share of retired workers returning to the workplace each month is higher than it was before the pandemicIn some cases retirees have little choice but to return Market turmoil has reduced the value of pension pots in America the total value of retirement assets fell by 45% in the first quarter Some retirees have run down “excess” savings that they had accumulated during the covid lockdowns And inflation now approximately 10% year on year across the rich world is cutting the purchasing power of fixed payments that those in their dotage are receiving Yet there are pull factors too The threat of the virus has dissipated meaning more people are comfortable with being in public spaces Thanks to red-hot demand for workers employers have had little choice but to set aside their prejudice and some erstwhile retirees are able to earn pretty well even if only working part-time Others though may simply have realised in Mr Brady words that their “place is still on the field and not in the stands” All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 15th 2022,Richer societies mean fewer babies Right?,In a speech to the Vatican in January Pope Francis made an observation fit for an economist He argued that declining fertility rates might lead to a “demographic winter” In every European country the total fertility rate the expected number of children a woman will have in her lifetime has now fallen below 21 the level needed to maintain a stable population without immigration The same is true in many developing countries including China and as of this year India This the pope warned would weigh on the world economic healthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEconomists have long considered such a slowdown inevitable In the best-known model of fertility popularised by Gary Becker a Nobel-prizewinning economist and others in the 1960s there is a central role for the trade-off between the “quantity and quality” of children As countries grow richer and the returns to education rise it is expected that families will invest more in a smaller number of children And as women working options expand the opportunity cost of their time will grow making the trade-off between family and career more difficult Fitting this theory many places have already gone through a “demographic transition” in which poor high-fertility countries become rich low-fertility ones In some the transition has been so dramatic that their populations have started to decline The number of people in Japan has fallen by about 3m since peaking at 128m in 2008 Many demographers suspect China population is also falling no matter what the country official figures claim Yet an emerging body of research suggests that fertility may go through another shift at a later stage of development A recent review of the literature by Matthias Doepke of Northwestern University and co-authors makes the case that in rich countries fertility may rise or at least fall at a slower rate if norms policies and the market for child care make it easier for a woman to have children and a career In countries with say supportive family policy or fathers who take on a greater share of child-care duties one would expect working women to have more children than in the pastOne way to see if this is true is to compare fertility rates across countries with differing incomes and female labour-force participation In 1980 countries in the oecd with higher female participation rates had lower rates of fertility By 2000 that relationship had flipped: countries with higher rates of female labour-force participation had higher rates of fertility Since then the picture has muddied slightly By 2019 the new relationship had weakened a little and it looks less sturdy when considering gdp per person rather than labour-force participationBut when looked at within countries the new pattern of fertility becomes clearer A paper published in 2018 by Michael Bar of San Francisco State University and co-authors shows that in America the relationship between education and fertility which used to be a downward-sloping trend has turned into something of a reversed-tick mark Women with advanced degrees have slightly more children than college graduates A similar pattern holds when looking at income The authors argue that the growing availability of child care has reduced the difficulty of the trade-off between family and workGovernments are also trying to change the picture Last year South Korea fertility rate dropped to 081 a record low In 2019 family-leave policy changed to allow parents with young children to take an additional year of reduced hours on top of an already generous year off work The share of South Korean parents who take leave has doubled in the past decade from 12% to 24% Meanwhile Hungary has exempted mothers of four or more children from income taxes for lifea more controversial approach especially since Viktor Orban the country prime minister has justified it as a way to boost the population without allowing immigration to rise A report published by the un last year found that the share of countries with pro-natalist policies had grown from 20% in 2005 to 28% in 2019Not all interventions are equally effective Work by Janna Bergsvik of Statistics Norway an official research outfit and colleagues finds that although some measures including subsidised child care make a difference others including parental leave accomplish far less Mr Doepke says the biggest boost to fertility occurs when interventions match the way that societies operate The provision of child care will make little difference if social norms push women to stay at home to look after children But in Denmark where fathers take on more child-care responsibilities than in other rich countries the provision of state-subsidised care for children made a big difference The country fertility rate rose from 138 in 1983 to 172 in 2021 Flush of youthThere is a lot riding on the new fertility switch lasting The share of the population in the oecd aged 65 and over is expected to have passed 50% by 2050 about 20 points higher than today As rich countries grow old there will be greater demand for carers which will make it more expensive to hire child care Without a productivity revolution perhaps featuring robot nannies child care will remain a privilege of the rich in places without state-funded provision It is also unclear if norms that make the family-career trade-off easier will continue to spread Yet the worse the problem becomes the harder governments will work to combat it And as they experiment evidence will build about which responses are the most effective The covid-19 pandemic may also end up helping It delayed many families’ decisions about whether to have children but in time it may turn out to have had a more positive impact The rise of working-from-home should make working with children easier In his speech the pope lamented those people who chose to look after pets instead of children Maybe that trade-off will lessen too Read more

 Sep 15th 2022,Why investors should forget about delayed gratification,The marshmallow test is a classic of standardised psychology A young child is given a marshmallow and told they can eat it whenever they like Wait for 15 minutes though and they can have two Then they are left alone When the test was first performed at Stanford University in the 1960s the average child succumbed in three minutes But those who did not were rewarded with more than just a sugar rush A follow-up study in 1990 showed that success on the test was associated with a whole range of goodies in later life from academic achievement to coping better with stressListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBy now the associated investment lesson is eye-rollingly familiar Jam tomorrow should be prized over jam today Valuing a firm by its present earnings assets and dividend yield is for the dinosaurs The pace of technological innovation has made these metrics obsolete; instead what matters is a company chance of explosive future growth For the canonical example look to Amazon: unprofitable for decades now the world fifth-largest company To their proponents the beating growth stocks have taken over the past year simply does not matter Truly innovative disruptive firms will eventually provide returns that make any number of temporary setbacks eminently bearableSuch thinking has guided some of the most successful investors of the past few decades Yet their strategies have played out during a 40-year period in which interest rates have mostly fallen Should that trend now reverseand the Federal Reserve seems set to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for its third meeting in a row on September 21st the logic will be turned on its head In a world of higher interest rates waiting for jam tomorrow just isn’t worth itTo see why first consider a crucial driver of this year downturn In place of current profits growth stocks offer the prospect of bigger ones in the future But a dollar in ten years’ time is not worth the same as a dollar today because the dollar today can earn income in the meantime At an interest rate of 1% you need to deposit $91 to have $100 in ten years’ time At a rate of 5% you can deposit just $61 Hence this year fall in growth stocks: as rates have risen the promise of future profits has become worth considerably less in the presentThis logic has broader implications than most investors realise Now imagine you will receive $100 a year for ever By the reasoning above this has a finite present value since compound interest means payments in the distant future are almost worthless With interest rates at 1% the payment stream is worth $10000; at 5% it is worth $2000 But as well as reducing the value the higher rate also changes the distribution of that value With rates at 1% less than a tenth of the stream value comes from payments made in the first ten years At 5% around two-fifths doesIn other words higher interest rates dramatically alter firms’ incentives when choosing which timeline to invest over Sacrificing short-term profits for longer-term gains is one thing when you are trying to persuade investors that your superapp machine-learning algorithm or gene-sequencing widget has the potential to up-end an industry It is another when even the best-case scenario has its value so heavily skewed towards what can be done in the next decade Startup founders are used to shaking off derision over implausible Utopian dreams It is more of a kick in the teeth to realise that even Utopia is not worth much unless it can be achieved in short orderNor are the implications limited to early-stage firms or even to the stockmarket Should profits be reinvested in a project that may not make returns quickly enough to be worthwhile or should they just be returned to shareholders as a dividend? Should a company with callable bonds and cash to spare bother repaying?

 Sep 13th 2022,America still has an inflation problem,Editor note September 14th 2022: This story has been updated to include markets’ reactionIt had been hoped that America latest inflation report would bring good news Headline annual inflation has been falling from the peak of 91% in June and economists expected August would bring a second month of modest increasesby recent standardsin core prices which exclude food and energy Those hopes were dashed The release on September 13th showed another drop in the headline annual rate to 83% But core prices rose 06% twice the 03% forecast The news hit markets: the s&p 500 index dropped by 44% as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates harder and faster to cool the economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInvestors are focused on core inflation because of big swings in energy prices The price of crude oil is down a quarter from its peak in early June In a breakdown of the August price data energy lowered the month-on-month inflation rate by nearly half a percentage point Other componentsfood goods and services such as rentpushed up prices see chartWere August rate of core inflation sustained for a full year it would mean a 74% annual rate which is well above the Federal Reserve target of 2% Investors believe the Fed will opt for its third consecutive three-quarter-point interest-rate increase when it meets later this month making for the most aggressive pace of tightening in four decades It may go further and raise rates by a full percentage pointOne critical factor in the persistence of high inflation is labour-market tightness With roughly two jobs available per unemployed person workers have strong bargaining power which leads to hefty wage gains A tracker from the Fed Atlanta branch shows that in August wages rose at an annualised pace of nearly 7% The grim conclusion for many economists is that America may require a marked increase in unemployment in order to temper wage pressures and ultimately inflationThe median projection of the Fed rate-setting committee is that the unemployment rate will only need to tick up slightly to 41% in 2024 from the current level of 37% But a recent paper by Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins University and Daniel Leigh and Prachi Mishra of the imf argues that a 41% level of unemployment would be consistent with core inflation of between 27% and 88% in 2024 In other words only in the rosiest scenarios does it seem America can escape the inflationary mire without lots of job lossesNevertheless the divergence between core and headline inflation poses an intriguing question As far as consumers are concerned there is no such distinction All prices matter and indeed prices at the petrol pump do more to capture the attention of Americans than prices anywhere else Surveys of consumers show that their expectations for future inflation have come down sharply since June undoubtedly thanks to the decline in oil pricesAs Mr Ball and his co-authors argue a failure to account for the pass-through from energy prices into core inflation was one reason why economists were wrong-footed by inflationary pressure over the past year The hope now is that the plunge in energy prices can continue and that the pass-through into weaker core inflation will again wrong-foot many economists For now however America inflation problem shows little sign of going away For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 12th 2022,China Ponzi-like property market is eroding faith in the government,The 120km train ride between the cities of Luoyang and Zhengzhou is a showcase of economic malaise and broken dreams From the window endless half-built residential towers pass one after another for the duration of the hour-long journey Many of the buildings are near completion; some are finished and have become homes But many more are skeletons where construction ceased long ago Developers have run out of cash and can no longer pay workers Projects have stalled Families will never get their homesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe train ride through China heartland helps to explain one of the country biggest crises in recent memory: the public loss of confidence in the government economic model For decades the property industry has been symbolic of China rise Private entrepreneurs have made vast fortunes Average people have witnessed their net worth soar as home values trebled Local governments have filled their coffers by selling vast tracts of land to developers An astonishing 70% of Chinese household wealth is now tied up in real estate To undermine trust in this model is to shake the foundations of China growth miracle With sweeping covid-19 lockdowns and a crackdown on private entrepreneurs this is happening on many fronts But nowhere is it clearer than in the property industry which makes up around a fifth of gdp New project starts fell by 45% in July compared with a year ago the value of new home sales by 29% and property investment by 12% The effects are rippling through the economy hitting furniture-makers and steelworkers alike The crisis comes at a critical time for Xi Jinping China leader who will probably be granted a third term at a party congress in October Reviving trust in the system is crucial for Mr Xi and the Communist Party Yet the government response has been disjointed and slow with officials seemingly overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation To regain faith in the housing market the public needs to see stalled projects finished Meanwhile construction firms and workers need to be reimbursed and investors paid back on their fixed-income products All this must be done without reinflating the unsustainable debt bubble that the property market has becomeThe housing crisis has two immediate causes The first is a crackdown on the property industry excesses Since August 2020 officials have restricted developers’ ratios of liabilities to assets net debt to equity and cash to short-term debt in a policy known as the three red lines This has forced many to stop unsustainable borrowing and sell down assets severely limiting their ability to continue building China zero-covid policy is a second blow The central government has forced dozens of cities to lock residents in their homes for days and sometimes weeks on end when covid cases are discovered At the time of writing the megacities of Chengdu and Shenzhen are fully or partly locked down The shutdowns have stopped people from viewing homes They have also had an impact on the consumer psyche Entrepreneurs fear the sudden closure of their businesses Employees worry about being laid off This sort of trepidation does not encourage homebuyingThe result is a crunch China developers need to sell homes long before they are built to generate liquidity Last year they pre-sold 90% of homes But without access to bonds and loans as banks cut their exposure to the property sector and with sales falling the Ponzi-like nature of the property market has come into full viewEvergrande the world most indebted developer defaulted in December An effort to restructure its offshore debts intended as a model to follow missed an end-of-July deadline At least 28 other property firms have missed payments to investors or gone into restructuring Trading in the shares of 30 Hong Kong-listed developers constituting 10% of the market by sales has been frozen according to Gavekal a research firm In early August half of China listed developers traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 05 the level that Evergrande traded at four months before it defaulted notes Song Houze of MacroPolo a think-tankFirms that just months ago were considered safe bets are now struggling Earlier this year analysts dismissed concerns that Country Garden China biggest developer by sales would come under pressure But on August 30th the firm revealed that profits for the first half of the year had fallen by almost 100% The property market has “slid rapidly into severe depression” it noted The firm difficulties indicate that problems are no longer specific to certain developers The entire industry is at riskPotential homebuyers have dropped out of the market Far more worrying though are the millions waiting often for years for homes for which they have paid Just 60% of homes that were pre-sold between 2013 and 2020 have been delivered Mr Liu who has asked to be referred to by his family name bought a flat in Zhengzhou in 2014 with an initial 250000 yuan $40000 down-payment The home was scheduled to be finished in 2017 But it never was Instead he rented a flat eventually buying another in an old building It is hardly the life he imagined Mr Liu never started paying his mortgage and has engaged in endless discussions with the property developer about getting back his down-payment “There no use” he saysAnalysts have known of these problems for years but had thought the authorities would not allow protests Two years ago a report by pwc an accounting firm noted that when building stalls the “unco-ordinated households normally have little ability to influence things” This calculation has been turned on its head A movement to collect data on the refusal to pay mortgages has taken officials by surprise On July 12th volunteers began sharing data on social media So far about 350 boycotts have been identified; analysts believe this is a fraction of the true number State censors try to remove references to the information but knowledge appears to spread nevertheless As it does others are persuaded to join inInvestors and potential homebuyers are now watching with unease as the state puts together its response For more than a decade cities have wielded a long list of rules and incentives to fine-tune real-estate markets usually to reduce speculation and cool prices These included limits over access to mortgages as well as on who can buy homes and how many they can buyCities are now loosening these rules Between May and July municipal governments announced 304 individual measures to restore confidence according to cicc a Chinese investment bank Zhengzhou at the centre of the protests was an early mover In March it announced 18 actions to stimulate demand including measures to make it easier to get mortgages and to allow families with elderly members to buy flats if they move to the city These have attracted attentionnot because they have revived demand but because they seem to contradict central-government policy In a video circulated on social media in August a local Communist Party chief in Hunan province was seen calling on people to buy as many homes as possible: “Did you buy a third one? Then buy a fourth” The message clashes with the one from Mr Xi himself who has warned that “homes are for living in” and certainly not for speculative investmentLocal governments have also been encouraged by regulators and officials to create bail-out funds to invest in unfinished housing projects and eventually to help deliver homes Zhengzhou has allocated 80bn yuan $12bn to the cause The thinking goes that local funds will be better suited to conditions on the groundZhengzhou is also trying perhaps the most aggressive plan yet City officials have issued a directive to developers that says all stalled construction must restart by October 6th Insolvent companies that cannot do so must file for restructuring to bring in new investment and repay down-payments made by homebuyers such as Mr Liu Failure to do so could result in developers being investigated for embezzlement and other serious crimesFor their part policymakers have repeatedly cut mortgage rates since mid-May To guarantee the supply of homes the central government is fully guaranteeing bond issuance by private developers shifting the risk to the state Longfor a struggling firm priced a 15bn-yuan bond at a 33% coupon rate on August 26th far below the market rate This was possible solely because the bond was underwritten by China Bond Insurance a state agency More such issuance is planned to deliver liquidity to developers the government views as higher quality It is the beginning of a programme to pick winnersAnother prong of state support takes the form of direct liquidity On August 22nd the central bank and finance ministry said that they would back special loans from state-directed policy banks to finish pre-sold homes The size of the programme has not been disclosed but Bloomberg a news service reported that 200bn yuan would be made availableThis public spending is a double-edged sword On the one hand it will help deliver homes and restart mortgage payments taking pressure off banks But at the same time the cash is filling a hole created by bad local governance and dubious property developers “That simply represents money that can’t be spent on stimulus elsewhere” notes Alex Wolf of JPMorgan Chase a bankZhengzhou efforts to encourage new buyers since March have fallen flat Conditions have continued to deteriorate suggesting that tinkering with city policies is not enough Local bail-out funds also look flimsy On paper several cities have hefty pots but they rely on local-government financing firms that are strapped for cash Analysts are watching Zhengzhou attempt to restart all construction within a month but many question if the necessary funds are available The measures could unleash collapses among smaller developers causing panic and financial turmoilInvestors have more hope in the central government but its response has so far failed to match the scale of the crisis The 200bn-yuan lending programme may account for just 10% of what is needed to complete all unfinished homes About $5trn-worth of residential property has been pre-sold since 2020 reckons Mr Song of MacroPolo making a bail-out of even a fraction of these homes incredibly costlyThe central government has more levers to pull Larry Hu of Macquarie an investment bank says a number of measures can be snapped into place These include temporarily easing the three red lines policy or vowing to act as a lender of last resort for all stalled projects The latter while expensive is fully within the central government financial wherewithalThe debate now focuses not on whether the central government can restore confidence but on how far it is willing to go The crackdown on leverage was meant to punish firms that had taken on too much debt A bigger bail-out will encourage more developers to ask for assistance pushing the government to subsidise more of the property sector writes Allen Feng of Rhodium a research firm: “quite the opposite of what was intended with the ‘three red lines’”The campaign against leverage was meant to bring the sector in line with demand Officials have long acknowledged that developers were building too much About 70% of homes sold since 2018 were bought by people who already owned one estimates JPMorgan Restricting debt was supposed to force firms to adjust to reality Demand is likely to fall as China population growth slows Home sales reached 157bn square metres in 2021 more than twice as high as in 2007 But Chen Long of Plenum another research firm projects that real annual demand will fall to 088bn-136bn square metres over the next decade as the demographic shift takes hold and urbanisation slows Reinflating the market means propping up the bubbleThe government balancing act is fraught with risk In mid-October the party congress will happen as cities lock down Mortgage boycotts will rumble on and possibly grow Confidence in China economic foundations could cross a threshold beyond which it becomes far more difficult to recover Mr Xi third term will start in inauspicious circumstances For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks

 Sep 8th 2022,Europe energy market was not built for this crisis,Most people hate fluctuating prices When they fall too far they are seen to be threatening firms When they rise too high they are seen to be unjustly enriching them But economists look at price movements and see the revelation of crucial information The recent frenzy about interventions in European electricity markets is an especially brutal example of this age-old dynamic Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn recent weeks forward prices for daytime electricity for the fourth quarter of the year briefly spiked above €1200 $1200 per megawatt hour in Germany and above a surreal €2500 in France The usual price is around €50 The reason for this is simple: scarcity The loss of generating capacity to maintenance in France closure in Germany and drought across the continent brought more and more gas plants into action and their fuel has become extremely expensive since Russia wielded its energy weapon Just like in any other market for a homogenous good the price of power is set by the most expensive supplier This means that even power plants with low operating costs such as nuclear ones or wind farms receive the high prices that gas plants are charging The result is vast profitsand public outrage Based on forward curves Morgan Stanley a bank reckons that electricity spending in the eu could rise by more than €800bn an increase worth an astonishing six percentage points of gdp Thus politicians have started to ask whether a different pricing mechanism is needed The problem is that designing an electricity market is hard The juice cannot yet be stored at scale and has to be delivered at the exact moment it is needed Producers need to spend a lot of money upfront to build a windmill or power plant and need to be able to recover it and make a profit over decades Climate-change policies dictate that more and more renewable electricity is fed into the system despite being mostly at the whim of wind and sunshine Europe current design is a sequence of markets some continent-wide where electricity providers such as power plants meet retail suppliers large industrial customers and others Some deals are made months or even years before electricity is delivered as suppliers and customers need clarity over revenues and costs The reference price for electricity and for the settlement of many long-term agreements is set on the spot market where the physical delivery of electricity is traded for the next day Suppliers bid according to how much it would cost to provide an extra unit of power known as its marginal cost The idea behind this is straightforward To generate electricity at low cost and in an increasingly carbon-free manner requires a lot of information Some technologies such as nuclear are good at providing a constant stream of power Gas is good for firing up quickly Solar is best around lunchtime The marginal price of power provides the information needed to switch between them by signalling the value of an additional unit of electricity The market also provides incentives to use power when it is cheapest to generate Currently prices are lowest at lunchtime and in the night The transition to renewable energy means that prices will become more volatile But that volatility is what drives innovation and investment in storage smart meters and hydrogen A high-capacity battery and the storage it provides will be most useful when prices oscillate between extremes For a while it looked as though the problem with Europe market was that prices were too low With more and more renewable energy entering the market the price of electricity sometimes fell to zero and even turned negative The question was how marginal gas power plantsthat might be needed to cover a windless cloudy winter daycould make enough money during the rest of the year to survive Some countries opted to add a capacity market; that is they auctioned off payments to generators just for being there Others stuck with an “energy-only market” The question now is very different Europe markets face sky-high prices for electricity as the result of a war It is a situation for which they were not designed Thus policymakers face three challenges The first is to preserve the marginal-price signal for both generators and consumers in the face of political pressure to weaken it Lowering prices for example by subsidising gas used in electricity generation as Spain and Portugal have done would elsewhere require some other form of rationing to allocate scarce energy Spain and Portugal can get away without rationing because Spain is an important gas hub so can easily import moreThe second is how and if to redistribute profits The German government has recently decided to grab those it considers excessive while leaving the price signal alone The European Commission may advise countries to do something similar It will do this through what is essentially a windfall tax that limits the share of the spot-market price that suppliers can keep The problem is that generators have hedged their exposure to differing degrees meaning the true recipients of the windfall profits may prove hard to find and may in fact sit outside the energy market Bright sparks neededThe third is to ensure that Europe energy market is ready for the next crisis and to do so without sacrificing its advantages At present the spot market efficiently allocates capacity and provides signals on energy scarcity offering an incentive for investment in renewables But to guard against sustained shortfalls in capacity and thus another price crunch Europe energy markets must adapt Long-term hedging markets are not very liquid because consumers used to see little need for price security In the future they will probably see more Regulators could help A proposal by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology advises them to buy “affordability options” from generators a form of insurance that would return profits from excessive prices to consumers in effect creating an automatic windfall tax How politicians would love to have something like that in place now Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Central bankers worry that a new era of high inflation is beginning Sept 1stHow to avoid energy rationing Aug 27thDoes unemployment really have to rise to bring down inflation?

 Sep 8th 2022,Why the dollar is strong and why that is a problem,Here are a few familiar descriptions of the dollar: “the cleanest shirt in the laundry basket” “the least-ugly mug in a beauty contest” “the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind” Nobody it seems loves the dollar; they just really dislike the alternatives And that aversion is only growing The dxy an index of the dollar against half a dozen major currencies is at a 20-year high see chart 1 Among the dirtiest of the dirty linen are sterling the euro and the yen see chart 2 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvery fresh lurch upwards prompts some big questions First what is driving it? Much of the recent rise reflects differences in monetary policy At the turn of the year the Federal Reserve became more determined to tackle inflation A series of interest-rate increases since then with more expected has turned the dollar into a high-yielding currency Lofty interest rates are a draw to global capital which in turn has pushed up the dollar The dollar is also a refuge in troubled times Scared investors tend to reach for the currency And high oil and gas prices are generally bad for energy importers such as Europe but good for energy exporters such as America The handful of currencies that have kept pace with or beaten the dollar this year tend to be those of energy-producing countries In short the dollar is the go-to currency largely because America has proved a reliable source of economic growth That is particularly true now Europe is edging closer to recession The closely watched purchasing-managers’ index suggests the euro-zone economy shrank in August Less noticed is that Asia is also losing steam Sluggish export growth is the latest worry for China economy the vitality of which has been sapped by a property hangover and the country zero-covid policy China weakness is apparent across Asia Industrial output fell sharply in South Korea Taiwan and Japan in July Export orders have slumped High energy costs have not helped The currencies of these countries have wilted against the dollar In Japan where the central bank has stuck with ultra-low interest rates the authorities have hinted that they may intervene to halt the yen slide In China there has been renewed action to support the yuan So is the dollar now a problem? In principle its strength is a remedy for unbalanced global growth since it gives European and Asian exporters an edge over domestic producers in the stronger American market In practice a strong dollar makes matters worse It squeezes global credit because countries and companies beyond America borders borrow in dollars So when the dollar rises it becomes more expensive to pay back debts out of local-currency revenues For many emerging-market economies the higher cost of dollar borrowing trumps the boost to exports they get from a weaker currency Dollar strength may not even be a boon for rich countries says Steve Englander of Standard Chartered a bank Exporters in Europe are hamstrung by energy disruptions so cannot take full competitive advantage of a favourable exchange rate Will the dollar ever weaken? For that three conditions need to be met First the global growth gap has to narrow A hard landing in America won’t do the trick A synchronised downturn in all regions of the world would only spark a run to the safety of the dollar although the beleaguered yen might finally catch a bid What is needed is for growth prospects outside America to improve A second condition is a rapid reduction in price and wage pressures in America This would allow the Fed to ease off the monetary brake withdrawing some yield support from the dollar The third condition is related to the first two: a weaker dollar requires some kind of good news on global energy Absent that it is hard to see Europe closing the growth gap with America None of these conditions seems likely to be met soon Until they are the dollar will stay mightybut only because the yen the euro and the rest are so puny For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

Ethereum researcher who created a meme showing two bears one black and one white doing the “fusion dance” from “Dragon Ball z” a popular anime show In the show the dance fuses two creatures into a single stronger one The pandaa combination of the two bearshas since become a symbol for “the merge”The merge is the name the crypto-community has given to the point at which the Ethereum blockchain will transition from using “proof-of-work” as a consensus mechanismthe method by which all the computers maintaining a blockchain agree to add new transactions to itto using “proof-of-stake” They call it the merge because for almost two years a separate proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon chain has been running alongside the original Ethereum one for developers to test improve and test again The Zoom call is for the developers to agree on when the two chains will join together The date and time of the event will depend on how much computer power is being used to maintain the blockchain but should happen at around 1am utc on September 15thThis is no mere technical tweak It is a complete overhaul of a $200bn software project that has been running for seven years which will if all goes to plan be implemented with no downtime People in crypto compare the process to changing the engine of an aeroplane mid-flight Proof-of-work is hugely energy intensive requiring vast amounts of computing power and has resulted in blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin consuming as much energy as small countries Proof-of-stake will require 999% less energy to operate The effect on emissions will be as though overnight Chile had been switched off see chart 1 More important still the merge will if successful show that Ethereum has the capacity for self-improvement opening the door to more sweeping changesCrypto is in need of good news for the past year has been a torrid one A handful of dodgy deposit-taking ventures have gone bust wiping out savings; a crypto hedge fund has blown up; a stablecoin was revealed to be anything but stable The total market capitalisation of crypto has crashed to around $1trn about $2trn lower than it was this time last year Ethereum improvements would not unpick any of this destruction But by reducing crypto environmental impact and highlighting the potential for future improvements it would suggest that it has a brighter future than many now appreciateThe idea for the Ethereum blockchain was first published in 2014 by Mr Buterin As with Bitcoin it is a large database of all the transactions that have ever taken place in the cryptocurrency But Mr Buterin crucial insight was that the blockchain could do much more than thatit could also keep track of lines of code This allows Ethereum to record transfers of the currency but also of all the assets and functions that are maintained in “smart contracts” self-executing agreements in which a chain of actions follows when certain conditions are met This capability has made it possible for developers to build a large network of financial institutions such as exchanges and lenders in code on the Ethereum blockchainThe blockchain is maintained by about a dozen pieces of software called “clients” that are worked on by the core developers These are built in a variety of programming languages including Go Rust Java and C# and the software is run by the “nodes”computers that run the client software to maintain the history of the Ethereum blockchain All decisions about what to do and whether upgrades will be implemented are made by a consensus among developers people who hold ether the native token of the Ethereum blockchain and people who have built applications on top of Ethereum or listed real-world assets on the blockchain Any plans and code are published in real time on GitHub a repository for programmers The core developers meet as pandas or otherwise to discuss potential upgrades every two weeks Anyone can in theory become a core developer just by working on the software The result is that developers are a rag-tag bunch Some are employed by firms like ConsenSys a Brooklyn-based blockchain-software outfit established by Joe Lubin one of the handful of people who helped found Ethereum after Mr Buterin white paper in 2014 Some are employed by the Ethereum Foundation a non-profit organisation set up in Zug Switzerland in 2014 with the proceeds of the sale of ether tokens Others are hobbyists incentivised to help out because they hold tokens At least 122 developers in 30 countries have worked on the merge software Ethereum is not a company and Mr Buterin for all his clout and importance as its creator is not its chief executive It is open-sourcemuch like Linux an operating system and Firefox a web browserbut the ability to buy a stake in its success through ether tokens provides an incentive to get involved in maintenance The extent to which governance is truly decentralised is not entirely clear In a recent interview with Noah Smith an economics blogger Mr Buterin said that at the start of the project in 2015 he was doing most of the research and thinking about what Ethereum should be as well as a lot of the coding to make it a reality By 2020 he was doing perhaps only a third of the research very little coding but most of the “high-level theorising” In the past two years he said even the high-level theory “has been slowly but surely slipping away from me”To implement a change like the merge requires sufficient consensus among the interested parties All the major clients must be rewritten to use the new code enough nodes must update their software and all the applications layered on the blockchainlike stablecoins backed by dollars in bank accountsmust accept the new merged chain is the one that will maintain the status of their assets It can be surreal to watch in real time It is as if The Economist started to live stream its editorial meetings and allowed subscribers to commission articles and select coversThe miners strikeNor are all the interested parties in favour of the merge Miners have invested as much as $5bn in hardware to run the proof-of-work consensus mechanism On September 15th or thereabouts that hardware will no longer earn them much of a return The way proof-of-work maintains the security of a blockchain is by incentivising hundreds of thousands of computers to solve a mathematical puzzle The computer that first finds a solution alerts the other miners and if they confirm the result updates the blockchain and is paid As such it pays in lovely freshly minted ether to have lots of mining hardware Proof-of-stake makes decisions about updating the blockchain by a vote among the holders of a cryptocurrency Voting power as well as the share of the rewards depends on how much ether has been staked If stakers misbehave such as by putting through faulty transactions their stake can be destroyed Thus on September 15th the advantage of having lots of mining hardware will disappear Instead the advantage will be in holding ether Miners could attempt to put off the merge by revolting But the nodes appear to be mostly going along with the update According to ethernode a website that tracks Ethereum activity around 75% have updated their software to be ready The alternative is to attempt to “fork” the blockchain by still running the old software and hoping that enough others do the same that the old version of the blockchain will continue to exist A dispute over a hack in 2016 led to Ethereum splitting into two chains: Ethereum the dominant one and “Ethereum Classic” a much smaller one For a split this time “there basically needs to be one single miner in the world who decides they want to continue with the proof of work” meaning there almost certainly will be one says Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation The question is how many miners stick and how many twist Chandler Guo who supported the Ethereum Classic fork in 2016 is attempting to organise miners around a proof-of-work token called “ethw” “I fork Ethereum once I will fork it again!” he has said Although the miners have reason to stay with the old way of doing things the economics of trying a forked chain will probably not add up It will only make sense to mine ethw if the value of the token is worth enough And a version of Ethereum minus DeFi apps stablecoins and developers is probably not worth very much Institutions such as Circle a stablecoin operator have thrown their weight behind the new approach rather than any forks In a statement on August 9th the firm said that it “intends to fully and solely support the Ethereum proof-of-stake chain post-merge” Wallet operators and exchanges are also backing the proof-of-stake chain These dynamics reveal the balance of power inherent in Ethereum The developers cannot put through updates that are universally hated because doing so would cause a messy fork; the miners cannot resist an update if everyone else supports it The decisions made by those that run applications on top of the blockchain like Circle can help solve disputes between the camps This is very different from traditional tech platforms Apple can push through an update that neither iPhone users nor app developers like and there is little either group can do about it short of ditching iPhones altogether There is no such thing as a “forked” iPhone The way Ethereum gets to a consensus is “kind of a messy and ad-hoc process” admits Mr Drake But there are enormous benefits if things go well The impact of the overnight elimination of its energy needs will be thinly spread as Ethereum is mined all over the world Almost half the nodes are in America; around a tenth are in Germany Other countries like Singapore Britain and Finland are home to less than 5% But in smaller countries where mining is disproportionately popular like Singapore it is possible energy prices could fall The change also reduces the need for mining hardware Nvidia a chipmaker makes graphics cards for gaming that can also be used for mining ether From May to July in part fuelled by rumours of an impending merge revenues from its chips fell by almost half compared with the previous three months On eBay prices of second-hand graphic cards are tumblingSince the network will no longer need so much energy and hardware to maintain it rewards for validating transactions can be reduced “With proof of work the scarce resource offered in return for rewards is computing power That is very expensive because you have to pay for electricity bills and you have to cover hardware costs” notes Mr Drake With proof of stake the scarce resource is instead digital money “So the maintenance cost is essentially the opportunity cost of that money which is maybe 3% or 4%” Thus Ethereum will pay out just 10% as many tokens per block validated by stakers post-merge as it did to miners before it This change in the monetary system is probably one reason why since the timing of the merge began to firm up in mid-July ether prices have jumped The currency has climbed by almost 50% even as bitcoin and other crypto tokens have traded sideways see chart 2 Ethereum boosters think a successful merge could pave the way for “the flippening” when the market capitalisation of ether surpasses that of bitcoin for the first time It is currently about half as valuable as its rival cryptocurrency which is close to its highest share since 2017 The other big benefit is security At the moment to take control of the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain an attacker needs 51% of the total computing power used to mine the currency Rough estimates put the cost of this at $5bn-10bn To attack a proof-of-stake blockchain would require buying up and staking half of all tokens which would currently cost around $20bn Some think these benefits will come at the cost of centralising power since under proof-of-stake big holders reap more rewards increasing their holdings further But says Ben Edgington of ConsenSys the blockchain-software firm this argument is wrong-headed Small stakes will earn less than big stakes but they will hold the same percentage of total outstanding tokens through time meaning their relative power will not change With proof-of-work there are also returns to scale from building huge mining rigs which are more efficient “There is no way someone could set up a competitive at-home mining rig” notes Mr EdgingtonBlocking progressAnother risk is that the transition fails in some way which could undermine public support Mr Lubin Ethereum co-founder is unperturbed He says “there has just been so much testing that I think the blockchain elements will go perfectly smoothly” The only potential missing link in the transition Mr Edgington thinks is the wider community Given the complications in installing new components and the need to get to grips with a new way of working some participants may be lost But there will only be problems if more than 40% are and that is unlikely he says Applications such as exchanges that run on top of the blockchain may though experience some hiccups Major software updates reveal all kinds of bugs in previously sound-looking code Important DeFi apps like Aave a lending platform are readying themselves by suspending transactions in ether over the merge periodIf all goes smoothly the merge will be a step towards a much more useful technology Many of the financial applications that operate on top of the blockchain are extremely efficient in part because they automate the functions of a financial system Smart contracts automatically match buyers and sellers or borrowers and lenders at an exchange An imf paper found that the marginal costs of financial intermediation by DeFi apps were about a third as much as rich-country banks and a fifth of emerging-market banks But the efficiency for users is hampered by how slow and expensive using the Ethereum blockchain can be At times when the network is busy the charges to have transactions recorded called “gas fees” can spike to as much as $100 for a single transaction Upgrades after the merge are mostly aimed at improving scale and efficiency In July at an Ethereum conference in Paris Mr Buterin joked that the path for the blockchain is first to “merge” and then “surge” “verge” “purge” and “splurge” The surge next on the list refers to “sharding” which is the process of splitting a database into pieces to spread the load This will allow the blockchain to process many more transactions and should reduce the fees required to use it ”Ethereum today can process about 15-20 transactions a second This Ethereum…it going to be able to process 100000 transactions a second” Mr Buterin proclaimedThe verge will implement a new kind of mathematical proof known as “Verkle trees” and make “stateless clients” possible That will mean someone can run the software to operate a node without having to store the entire “state” of the blockchain an enormous amount of data The purge will remove old data on the blockchain history The splurge is “all of the other fun stuff” which could be anything that Mr Buterin and the cryptoheads fancy A successful merge is the first step on the path towards all of these changes It would prove that decentralised groups of people can do risky contentious and important things Time to find out if they can Clarification September 7th 2022: An earlier version of this article did not attribute some of Mr Buterin quotes to an interview by Mr Smith This attribution has now been addedFor more expert

 Sep 5th 2022,The digital yuan offers China a way to dodge the dollar,In recent military drills China has simulated an invasion of Taiwan which it considers a “renegade province” Talk of war has preoccupied Chinese bloggers pundits and politicians since Nancy Pelosi speaker of America House of Representatives visited Taipei in AugustListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFinance officials in Beijing have no doubt been prepping for a conflict too They have watched with dismay as America and its allies imposed crippling sanctions on Russian banks and kicked seven of them out of swift a Belgium-based messaging network used to send payment instructions A Chinese invasion of Taiwan could result in similar measures freezing Chinese banking activity abroad In a shooting war over Taiwan no one knows who would win In a financial war an American victory seems assuredChina dependence on the dollar has long been a source of frustration in Beijing It not only cements China vulnerability to sanctions but also exposes China to America macroeconomic whims To many officials it is perverse that their country the world largest exporter and official creditor should rely so heavily on the currency of the world biggest importer and borrower For over a decade China has tried to promote the yuan as an alternative Yet progress has been hampered by another source of Chinese discomfort: uncontrolled capital flows see chart 1 China limits on the movement of its moneyin place to prevent speculationmake the yuan difficult for the world to embrace Thus few bankers think the yuan will soon replace the dollar as the world currency of choice But that is not the only prize worth pursuing Other goals are more feasible and more urgent In particular China technocrats aspire to build a payments system that is easier for its trading partners to use and harder for America to block They might also hope that such a system could make the yuan more influential abroad without compromising China capital controls at homeNew technology might help Since May 2020 China has been experimenting with a digital version of the yuan now known as the e-cny Residents of 23 pilot zones across 15 provinces can download “e-wallets” onto their phones The wallets are provided by their banks or popular payment platforms like Alipay But the e-cny they contain represent a claim on the central bank itself Some 260m individuals and 45m shops can now handle the digital yuan according to the People Bank of China pboc the central bank Thanks to promotions and handouts the digital currency has been used in over 260m transactions worth about 83bn yuan $12bn since its inception until the end of May with an average transaction size of about 300 yuan China insists the e-cny is first and foremost for domestic use Officials were spooked by innovations like Libra and Diem the digital currencies proposed by Facebook They also want a secure backstop and perhaps a rival to Alipay and WeChat Pay the hegemonic private payment platforms For this reason the e-cny has been designed for retail use It can be held by individuals and non-financial firms rather than just banksYet a few Chinese scholars are willing to voice greater ambitions Sun Lijian of Fudan University has argued that a digital yuan might help break the dollar monopolistic status and could be used to finance projects associated with the Belt and Road Initiative China overseas infrastructure-building programme Some of the biggest believers in the e-cny potential seem to be wary observers in America A recent book published by the Hoover Institution a think-tank argues that the e-cny could play an important role in internationalising the yuan and “transforming the geo-economic landscape” In particular “it is likely that countries seeking to circumvent us sanctions will explore using the e-cny as an alternative channel for cross-border transactions” it notedThe e-cny could help internationalise the yuan in several ways It could make it easier and cheaper for foreigners to make cross-border paymentsand harder for America to block those transactions for geopolitical purposes That would increase the appeal of the yuan even if China capital controls remained in place The digital yuan could also change the way those controls work by programming them into the currency itselfWithin China e-cny payments are quick and free for now The central bank may charge a fee in future according to Caixin a Chinese magazine to operators of the wallets and linked services if not to end users The pboc has made no announcements about how an overseas user might receive a wallet But China bankers are full of speculation Some believe Chinese regulators will set up a special financial zone where users abroad could apply for wallets Here banks and other financial-services firms would be invited to create “know-your-customer” businesses for the screening of applicants Foreign users might eventually be allowed to do this remotely through Chinese banks in their home countriesOnce a foreigner has qualified for a wallet e-cny transactions with other wallet-holders should be quick and cheap even if they are separated by a geographical border In the early stages most transactions would be with Chinese firms or customers But once the number of foreign wallet-holders reaches a critical mass some payments need not have a Chinese user on the other side of the tradeCross-currency transactions seem a more distant prospect But China experiment with the e-cny has spurred many other governments to look into digital currencies of their own and how they might be exchanged with each other Take for example mBridge a programme set up by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and joined by the pboc the central banks of Thailand and United Arab Emirates and the Bank for International Settlements a club of central banks in Switzerland One initial aim is to enable digital-currency transactions in the Greater Bay Area a large region in southern China where three currencies the yuan the Hong Kong dollar and Macau pataca now operate The involvement of other central banks indicates mBridge long-term ambitions are much largerPlatforms like these could eventually help settle international payments at a fraction of the expense of the current correspondent-banking model The cost of sending a $500 remittance through a bank from South Africa to China now averages over 14% or $70 see chart 2 The technologies underlying digital currencies have been found to cut the transaction energy and storage costs connected with these legacy systems Moving away from centralised clearing and creating competition among various platforms could also help bring down costs For China the project is strategic not commercial and therefore it will almost certainly seek to undercut other systems on price notes a recent paper by Ross Buckley of the University of South Wales Douglas Arner of the University of Hong Kong and others Such systems might also be less vulnerable to sanctions America response to Russia war in Ukraine has shown that Western powers can debilitate foreign banks by kicking them out of swift America can also bar its financial institutions from dealing with a country under sanctions making it impossible for the country banks to settle dollar payments with the rest of the world Payments in digital yuan would use neither the dollar nor swift and could conceivably bypass commercial-banking institutions altogetherThe e-cny might make America financial weapons less convenient and less precise thus raising the bar to their use But it would not spike them altogether Even if America could not directly prevent an e-cny transaction from going through it could still deny access to its clearing system to any institution using the e-cny in a way it did not like ie to serve a blacklisted country Since America could not monitor e-cny activity as closely as it can monitor dollar payments some transactions might escape its notice Yet if the inscrutable e-cny became too big a threat to its sanctions regime America could in theory ban its use by any institution that wants to retain access to the American clearing system That would force the world to choose between the dollar and the digital yuan Remote capital controlsLower transaction costs and less vulnerability to sanctions could make the e-cny more appealing to foreigners Other characteristics of the digital yuan could make its overseas use less nerve-wracking for China authorities Officials worry less about capital leaving the country than about it leaving the currency They are fairly relaxed about Chinese residents and firms accumulating yuan-denominated claims on the rest of the world But they worry about runs on the currency especially if those runs develop speculative momentum In China regulators can limit the amount of yuan that residents are allowed to sell for foreign currency They can also quiz residents about why they want dollars Regulators do not have the same control over non-residents especially if non-residents hold yuan in foreign banksSeveral aspects of China existing financial plumbing betray this nervousness Its own cross-border interbank payments system cips has been slow to admit foreign banks for example Within this system yuan payments can leave China but stay within a trusted circle of largely Chinese intermediaries Its “Wealth Connect” programme introduced last year creates another kind of closed loop It allows rich individuals in China to buy investment products in Hong Kong thereby gaining exposure to assets denominated in foreign currencies But when they cash out of those investments they may do so only in yuan This stops people from moving trunk-loads of yuan out of China The e-cny could enable another closed loop Transactions in e-cny take place across the balance-sheet of China central bank That makes it easier for the authorities to monitor the use of China currency even among non-residents Because the e-cny can only pass between approved e-wallets China authorities could also weed out potential speculators during the approval process Digital wallets would be likely to encode a number of user characteristics such as their country of residence and the industry they work in These sorts of details could be used to grant or deny people and firms access to yuan payments or limit their payments to certain sizes China could then be confident that any digital yuan circulating outside its borders would not fall into the wrong hands for the wrong reasons With such control academics speculate that demand for e-cny among unsavoury parties would be lowChina digital currency is also “programmable” The e-cny can be distributed with conditions such as a time frame for spending it In theory any condition can be programmed into digital currencies says Michael Sung of FreeFlow Finance a cross-border payments firm Regulators could for example set limits on how much could be sold for foreign currencies That would help them to limit any runs on the currency even if the yuan were held by foreigners beyond their normal regulatory reachImagine for example that e-cny wallets were granted to a number of grain traders in Africa alongside related businesses such as farmers pesticides vendors and logistics firms Money lent to these companies could be programmed to be exchangeable only with approved companies within this supply chain The pboc could also monitor payment flows closely Cashing out the e-cny into other currencies with unapproved banks could be easily stoppedSuch control and a god eye view of the currency could make the pboc more comfortable with allowing flows of its currency into trade finance and supply chains Charles Chang of Fudan University points out that authorities have already been experimenting with changes to yuan-convertibility rules in Hainan Officials have said that Hainan will become a free-trade port by 2035 They aim to make the island province an offshore trade and finance centre much like Hong Kong As Mr Chang notes it is not hard to imagine this type of finance zone being used as a base to conduct digital-yuan trade financeBut will users outside of China want it? In poorer countries probably yes Securing financing in dollars in poor parts of Africa can be incredibly difficult Supply is limited Business owners often wait weeks and pay hefty fees and bribes for access Many firms in poorer countries already opt for yuan-based trade finance when it is available A switch to e-cny could only help as long as there is ample supply of it and overseas users can get digital walletsA restricted currency is naturally less appealing than an unrestricted one just as food stamps are worth less than their equivalent in cash So a programmed digital yuan would be less appealing than a currency free of restrictions Yet if China conventional currency remains hard to come by because of the government nervousness about speculation and misuse then the digital yuan could be a viable alternative It would be less freely usable but more freely available Moreover most users of a currency have no intention of panic-selling the currency unless everyone else does So technological speed bumps designed to prevent runs need not be fatal to the digital yuan international appealMuch of this is still speculation As tensions rise with America the domestic roll-out of e-cny will bring little comfort to Chinese technocrats who fret about imminent conflict In the long-term though the digital currency will be more significant It may eventually help the yuan span the world without leaving its lane For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 1st 2022,Distressed-debt investors are preparing to pounce,Hedge funds are used to being the star players in corporate America most aggressive sport: financial distress They search for value in the liabilities of troubled firms often hoping to participate in the restructuring of a company balance-sheet And after a decade of unpleasantly benign financial conditions excitement in the industry is building A toxic cocktail of rising interest rates slowing growth and high inflation is already creating pockets of distress High-yield debt issuance has dried up see chart and it is increasingly difficult for companies to refinance their liabilities or raise fresh funds In July the amount of distressed debt which includes bonds yielding more than ten percentage points over Treasuries and loans trading at heavy discounts surpassed $240bn nearly three times as much as at the start of MayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDistressed-debt investors have waited a long time for conditions like these Their approach was born in the aftermath of the 1980s leveraged-finance boom but came of age during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 when the face value of distressed and defaulted debt reached $36trn Lehman Brothers a former investment bank contributed more than $600bn of that Since 2011 funds have raised around $500bn in anticipation of more distress but have had few opportunities to spend it A decade of low interest rates made borrowing easy and distress rare Even the covid-19 pandemic turned out to be a false dawn since the door to liquidity was held open by massive central-bank stimulusAlthough clouds are now gathering in credit markets distressed-debt investors will not have things all their own way Instead they will have to adjust to a new balance of power between lenders and borrowers Lending to risky companies in the past decade has been not only vast but loose Maintenance covenants financial commitments which lenders can use as a “stick” to force a restructuring have all but disappeared Combined with low interest payments their absence means it will take longer for lenders to get companies to join them at the negotiating table That is if distressed-debt investors can purchase debt in the first place Today it is common for leveraged-loan documentation to include blacklists to prevent specialist funds from buying inOnce at the table an emboldened opponent awaits One trend in particular has sent the secretive tight-knit world of distressed-debt investing into a spin: aggressive “priming” transactions which involve subordinating secured lenders In one variation the borrowing company transfers collateral backing its existing loans to a subsidiary free from creditors’ rights This allows the company to re-use the collateral to raise new debt in effect shoving the original lenders down the pecking order if it comes to divvying up assets After shifting around its valuable intellectual property in this fashion JCrew the preppy American clothing brand became a verb Since then the creditors of companies including Revlon a beauty brand Golden Nugget a chain of hotels and casinos and Travelport a tourism firm have all been said to be “JCrewed”Another new tactic involves a company working with a group of its creditors encouraging them to engage in what is ominously referred to as “creditor-on-creditor violence” In one type of “uptier” transaction a company persuades a majority of its creditors to amend loan documentation to allow it to incur more senior debt Lenders who consent are generously rewarded often by participating in this new raise watching the priority and value of their rival lenders’ debt decline In other words borrowing companies pay Peter by allowing him to take money from PaulIn March a court in New York concluded that one manoeuvre undertaken in 2020 by Serta Simmons Bedding a mattress manufacturer may have breached the firm credit agreement Legal challenges to similar transactions are rumbling on and loans increasingly include tighter wording to prevent these deals But while uptier transactions and other similar moves are disputed they are a long way from vanquishedDistressed-debt investors should not be surprised by these new challenges For the story of the past decade cheap leverage is also that of private equity which spent $850bn on leveraged buy-outs in 2021 alone A recent study by Vincent Buccola at the University of Pennsylvania explains the rise of hardball tactics in this light According to his analysis 18 of the 19 priming transactions undertaken to date have involved a private-equity sponsor Private-equity executives with personal fortunes at stake and an Olympic capacity for legal gymnastics are proving considerably more adversarial than the sleepy corporate-management teams of oldThus Wall Street most sophisticated operators increasingly shape the tactics of both lender and borrower providing a vivid illustration of the triumph of finance over the real economy After a decade of loose lending and buy-outs increased corporate distress is now almost inevitable The erosion of creditors’ protections will leave distressed-debt investors waiting longer to capitalise on this chaos When they do reach the boardroom expect some gladiatorial clashes For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money

one below it is ominous A true chartist needs only such information and “does not even care to know what business or industry a company is in as long as he or she can study its chart” as Burton Malkiel an economist at Princeton and author of “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” has noted These methods though patently mad have attracted attention lately because of how the s&p 500 the leading index of American stocks has wiggled around After slumping to a low of 3637 on June 17th the index began to climb On August 16th it peaked at an intraday high of around 4325 a whisker away from its 200-day moving average of 4326a supposedly critical technical level An asset that has fallen in price but is rising is supposed to meet “resistance” at such levels To chartists it is concerning when an asset fails to “break through” a resistance barrierit is an indication of a bear-market rally rather than a true bull market And so this time it appears to have been: stocks have slumped by around 8% since August 16thPlenty of mainstream investors use some version of trend-following Factor investing invented by Eugene Fama the Nobel prize-winning economist and Kenneth French is used by successful quantitative funds like aqr Capital Management It breaks down returns into component factors like “size” small companies earn better returns than bigger ones or “quality” low-debt stable businesses earn better returns than riskier ones Another such factor is momentum: stocks that are rising tend to keep rising Still their approach is a little more sophisticated than looking at a price chart aqr algorithms tend to combine factors like momentum with others They might buy say a small or high-quality firm whose share price has recently risenIt is nevertheless possible to understand the chartists’ obsession with levels and trends There is no real difference between a euro being worth $10001 or $09999 but these “big figures” in foreign-exchange markets assume importance This is in part symbolic and in part practical: clients tend to place orders near round numbers and derivatives tend to be sold with round “strike prices” That means it will take a lot more activity for the euro to fall from $10001 to $09999 than for it to fall from $10487 to $10485 When placing orders investors try to figure out where others are placing theirs That can help them place a stop-loss order to close a trade that moves against them at a sensible level If enough investors look at technical levels to inform their behaviour then they begin to matter Perhaps the real value of technical analysis is what its use tells you about market conditions No one bothers with the chartists’ pretty drawings when the economy is good profits are high and stocks are moving smoothly highernor indeed in the depths of a frantic bear market when prices will plunge through any and all levels technical analysts are wont to draw Much as people who are feeling restless about the direction of their lives are more prone to become interested in astrology investors who are uneasy about the direction of the markets will reach for the easy reassurance of an eye-catching diagram That some are laying the blame for the end of the summer rally on a technical tripwire suggests they have little idea what is really going on Perhaps Buttonwood should derive a technical indicator of her own: the more regularly chartist analysis lands in her inbox the clearer it is that no one has any clue as to why the markets are movingCorrection September 2nd 2022: An earlier version of this article said Eugene Fama and Kenneth French won the Nobel prize for their work on factor investing They did not Mr Fama won a Nobel prize for his work on the efficient-markets hypothesis Mr French is yet to win a Nobel Sorry Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Investors are optimistic about equities They have no alternative Aug 18thReminiscences of a financial columnist Jul 30thThe Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 1st 2022,China and America long-awaited audit deal may yet fail,At some point in September a team of American inspectors will touch down on Chinese soil in the hope of doing something miraculous: freely inspecting the internal auditing paperwork of Chinese firms listed on American exchanges The agreement to do so announced on August 26th has been a decade in the making and could prevent the delisting of some $940bn in Chinese shares that trade in New York Success however is still far from guaranteed Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSince 2011 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board pcaob an auditing governance body has demanded that accounting firms auditing New York-listed Chinese companies open the companies’ books for inspection These reviews were made all the more urgent by repeated instances of fraud by Chinese firms Yet the Chinese government had pushed back at times declaring such paperwork “state secrets” and threatening criminal charges against anyone who reveals themA law passed in America in 2020 the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act gave auditors three years to comply before their Chinese clients were forcibly delisted When in March the Securities and Exchange Commission America market watchdog published a list of firms slated for delisting it caused the sharpest fall in American-traded Chinese stocks in more than a decade In mid-August fears of impending financial turmoil grew when five Chinese state-owned companies voluntarily delisted from American exchanges For their part regulators in Beijing had sent a cold message to investors in America A crackdown on Didi Global a Chinese ride-hailing firm just days after it listed in New York implied that the Chinese government cared little about the reputation of companies listed on foreign markets All this means the deal between the pcaob and the China Securities Regulatory Commission csrc comes as a welcome surprise It seems to show that leaders in Beijing still see some value in financial links with Americadefying predictions of an imminent financial decoupling between the world two largest economies Signing the deal may have been the easy part however Lawyers working on cross-border regulatory arrangements note that carrying it out will be fraught with risks The statements released by the pcaob and the csrc are contradictory in places The Americans note that they will not need to go through Chinese authorities to access documents There can be “no loopholes and no exceptions” their statement says The Chinese say all arrangements will be done through the csrc A single disagreement on access could end up derailing the entire dealGiven the Chinese government sensitivity around data the inspections could be awkward The pcaob can examine documents not just from the current year but from a few years back While the most recent audit documents may have been prepared without the data disclosures that China considers a national-security risk documents requested from previous years may still contain sensitive information notes Travis Lundy of Smartkarma a research firmThat might help explain why even though the deal has been signed the market is so far pricing in only a 50% chance of eventual success according to analysts at Goldman Sachs a bank Agreements between China and America have a poor record when it comes to implementation Analysts at Bernstein a broker reminded investors of another high-profile pact meant to patch up relations: “Remember the Trump phase one trade deal?” That agreement failed miserably For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 31st 2022,Europe is heading for recession How bad will it be?,Editor note September 2nd 2022: On September 2nd Gazprom said that its Nord Stream 1 pipeline would not resume supplies of gas to Europe on September 3rd as originally plannedEvery single warning light is flashing red Russia war on Ukraine an uneven recovery from the covid-19 pandemic and a drought across much of the continent have conspired to create a severe energy crunch high inflation supply disruptionsand enormous uncertainty about Europe economic future Governments are rushing to try to help the most vulnerable Amid the nervous confusion there is broad agreement on one thing: a recession is comingListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKQuite how bad the downturn will be depends on how the energy shock plays out and how policymakers respond to it This week energy prices reached once-unimaginable heights: more than €290 $291 per megawatt hour mwh for benchmark gas to be delivered in the fourth quarter of the year the usual pre-pandemic price was around €30; and more than €1200 per mwh for daytime electricity for the same quarter in Germany up from around €60 Because gas is the marginal fuel in most European electricity markets it sets the price for power more broadlyThe European economy entered the crisis in a reasonably strong position The labour market is still relatively healthy with unemployment at 66%meaning by Europe mediocre standards that the economy is near to full employment Wage growth will probably pick up in the coming months as long-term contracts are renegotiated Consumer confidence fell at the beginning of the war but consumption didn’t slump Inflation expectations have subsided somewhat Yet things will look considerably gloomier in a few months for three reasons First industry is under pressure In the spring the leaders of Europe largest manufacturers argued that cutting off Russian gas supplies too swiftly would bring economic crisis to the continent Despite high prices industrial production has so far remained strong “Part of the reason is that firms are still working off the backlog of orders from the past” says Michael Hüther from the German Economic Institute a think-tank But these backlogs will not last for ever and some crucial forward-looking indicators are grim “New orders minus inventoriesthat is the demands on firms that keep them busyhave fallen off a cliff” says Robin Brooks at the Institute of International Finance which represents banks and institutional investors The decline reflects a weakening global and in particular Chinese economy As Mr Brooks notes such a drop can mark a turning-point in the economic cycleThe worst-affected industries will probably be east of the Rhine Recent surveys of industrial bosses in Germany and Austria point towards contraction Germany unhealthy reliance on Chinese buyers risks dragging down demand for goods across the Teutonic supply chain Italian industry appears to be in free fall Poland and the Czech Republic both sitting outside the euro zone are vulnerable too The exception is Hungary where manufacturing is expanding at a healthy pace thanks to battery investment the electric-vehicles boom and long-term energy contracts although some of them will soon come to an endThe second reason for gloom is that consumer spending on services will struggle to hold up the continent economy Buoyed by a strong season in France and the south of Europe as holidaymakers made exuberant use of their pandemic savings tourism added to growth over the summer But sentiment is declining as consumers tighten their belts in preparation for a long cold winter Services are likely to stagnate over the coming months with real estate and transport facing particularly severe difficulties according to s&p Global purchasing managers’ indexLast Europe will almost certainly see the energy shock coincide with rising interest rates Having underestimated price increases along with many other of the world central banks the ecb is now determined to bring annual inflation back to its target of 2% from the alarming 91% recorded in August Isabel Schnabel a member of the bank board argued in favour of inflicting more pain on the economy to see the job through at the Federal Reserve recent gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming Economists therefore expect the ecb to try to buttress its inflation-fighting credentials with a substantial interest-rate rise in its next policy meeting on September 8th possibly lifting rates by three-quarters of a percentage point In expectation yields on European short- and longer-term bonds have increased in the past month Despite this the euro has continued to slump dropping to parity with the dollar for the first time in two decades That reflects a deteriorating outlook for Europe economy and the decision of global investors to turn elsewhere in response It is becoming yet another worry for the continent policymakers as a weaker currency fuels inflation through dearer imports hitting real incomes and thus consumption All this suggests that the European economy is certain to enter a recession led by Germany Italy and central and eastern Europe Analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank expect annualised growth rates of -2% for the euro area overall in the fourth quarter of this year -25% for France and Germany and -3% for Italy Italy troubles and high debts could trigger jitters in Europe bond markets European politicians have so far spent a lot of time thinking about how to respond to surging energy prices They could soon have a broader crisis on their hands For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 30th 2022,Vast corporate profits are delaying an American recession,To the ears of many “pricing power” is something of a dirty term For left-wingers it conjures up images of greedy corporations abusing their market dominance to charge more For economists it raises the spectre of sticky inflation as companies ratchet up prices to cover higher costs But from another perspective pricing power is less of a problem: it enables firms to withstand the kind of inflationary pressures that they are now experiencing In so doing it serves as a shock absorber for the economy forestalling the risk of a recessionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe past few weeks have put pricing power in the spotlight in America According to data published on August 25th post-tax corporate profits reached 121% of gdp in the second quarter their highest since at least the 1940s see chart When companies announced their second-quarter results dozens noted their capacity to raise prices in the face of higher wages and dearer inputs Chipotle a fast-food chain emphasised that it had sold more expensive burritos to its relatively affluent customers The boss of Hilton boasted that having raised room rates sharply in the face of strong demand the hotel chain was set for “the biggest summer” in its century-long history At ibm a tech giant an executive reported that the company was at last “starting to capture the reality” of higher costs in its pricingThe combined effect of all these individual corporate decisions is striking Nearly three-quarters of companies in the s&p 500 America main stock index beat earnings estimates in the second quarter Overall their net profit margins were roughly 12% a touch lower than in the same quarter last year but still above their five-year average of 11% That helps explain the rally in stockmarkets that got going in mid-June It also adds to the evidence that despite all the gloomy talk America economy is in reasonably good shapeand is not in recessionIf there were a compression in margins it would portend a downswing in the business cycle Facing lower profits companies are forced to find ways to cut costs which often include firing workers When sufficient numbers do that it becomes a drag on the rest of the economy Conversely comfortable margins suggest less cost-cutting pressure Thus the corporate results of the past couple of months are squarely on the side of resilienceWhy are companies doing so well? Unsurprisingly energy firms have led the pack benefiting from the surge in oil and gas prices that followed Russia invasion of Ukraine in February Revenues for the s&p 500 including energy companies were up by nearly 14% in the second quarter compared with a year ago Excluding energy companies they were up by 9% according to FactSet a data providerNevertheless even allowing for the outperformance of the energy sector profitability has been impressive Part of the explanation may be that American companies have more market power than a few decades ago bringing greater stability to their earnings Laxer application of anti-monopoly laws over the years as well as the return-to-scale of big-tech platforms help account for that Yet the robustness of profits over the past year is down to something far more basic: the rude health of both consumers’ and companies’ balance-sheets In nominal terms final demand has been well above its pre-pandemic trend fuelled by several rounds of stimulusThe question is how long the good times will last Pessimism is building as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to combat inflation In July a survey of chief financial officers by ubs a bank found that they were more downbeat about their pricing power over the next 12 to 24 months than they had been in January Some companies are already cutting back their capital-spending plans which could spill over into hiring too But this is all being done from a position of considerable strength Aneta Markowska an economist at Jefferies another bank says the Fed may ultimately be forced to induce a recession to curb inflation but adds that it will have a fight on its hands in part because of the resilience of profit margins “It like a Mike Tyson economy” she explains “It a lot stronger than you think and it going to take a lot of work to take it down” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 30th 2022,Central bankers worry that a new era of high inflation is beginning,In august 2020 Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve described a shift in the central bank policy framework “The economy is always evolving” he noted “Our revised statement reflects our appreciation…that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation” It was a pivot informed by a long period in which prices as often rose by less than the Fed preferred as by more Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTwo years on the Fed faces very different circumstances: rock-bottom unemployment strong wage growth and rates of inflation far above the central bank target On August 26th at an annual jamboree for central bankers in Jackson Hole Wyoming Mr Powell sang a different tune “Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone” he declared and added that the Fed was prepared to impose economic pain to get inflation back to target Just how much might be required remains anyone guess But the economists and policymakers gathered under the Teton mountains repeatedly voiced a serious concern: that the global forces which in recent decades helped to keep inflation low and stable may be weakeningor reversing To misquote Milton Friedman inflation is often and mostly a monetary phenomenon Central banks have many tools to constrain spending across an economy and thus to prevent demand from outstripping supply in a manner that fuels inflation But they do their work against an evolving economic backdrop which may make taming price pressures easier at some times than at others From the 1980s onwards inflation in the rich world generally fell and became less volatile The phenomenon is commonly attributed to better monetary policy but also to benign global conditions relative to those which confronted central banks in the 1960s and 1970snamely spend-happy governments and energy shockswhen economies were battered by falling productivity growth The world may now “be on the cusp of historic change” as Agustín Carstens of the Bank for International Settlements a club for central banks put it at Jackson Hole Worriers see a few reasons why inflation may stay high Government spending and borrowing patterns seem to have changed for one Across rich and emerging economies public-debt loads have soared over the past two decades As debt burdens rise markets may begin to fear that central banks will eventually have to help finance governments’ obligations say by creating new money to buy bonds That could erode central-bank credibility and raise the public expectations of future inflation The fiscal firepower deployed during the covid-19 pandemic may also reflect governments’ greater openness to using stimulus to fight recession which could likewise cause markets to expect more spending and inflation Work presented at the conference by Francesco Bianchi of Johns Hopkins University and Leonardo Melosi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggests that American inflation stood roughly four percentage points higher than it otherwise would have been thanks to the “fiscal inflation” associated with the $19trn stimulus package passed in 2021 Workers are scarcer too Population growth in the rich world has slowed dramatically owing to demographic change and lower immigration In some economies like America the pandemic was associated with a further drop in labour-force participation From the 1990s to the 2010s global labour supply expanded rapidly as populous economies like China and India became better integrated into the world economy But that experience cannot be repeated and ageing is beginning to hit labour supply in parts of the emerging world as well Workers may thus enjoy more bargaining power in the future spurring wage growth and make life harder for inflation-fighting central banks Then there are slow-burning changes to the structure of the global economy Both emerging and advanced economies engaged in a wave of liberalising reform from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s Tariffs fell while labour and product markets grew more limber These reforms contributed to a surge in global trade large-scale shifts in global production and falling costs across a range of industries Reform may have bolstered productivity growth too which ticked up in advanced economies at the turn of the millennium and in emerging economies in the 2000s But the pace of reform fell and productivity growth ebbed after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 while trade came under sustained pressure from trade wars the pandemic and geopolitical tensions Globalisation served as a “gigantic shock absorber” from the 1980s into the 2010s noted Isabel Schnabel of the European Central Bank such that shifts in demand or supply were easily met through corresponding adjustments to production rather than wild swings in prices Now that flexibility is at risk Nowhere to runFor the attending central bankers this was bracing stuff But it need not be apocalyptic Some trends could make a new macroeconomic era a little easier to bear Demographic change may cut both ways as Gita Gopinath of the imf remarked Though workers in ageing economies may be scarce they will also save more helping mitigate inflationary pressures And as those at the symposium discussed changes spurred by the pandemic may yet yield a productivity dividend Most crucially there is less intellectual confusion today than there was in the 1970s As Mr Powell noted central bankers once needed convincing that they could and should bear responsibility for the level of inflationa situation that allowed high inflation to rage for more than a decade Today by contrast the Fed “responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional” Central bankers are beginning to accept that their task may be harder for years to come That awareness could itself prevent a new era of shocks and volatility from being truly disastrous Read more from Free Exchange our column on

 Aug 28th 2022,The missing pandemic innovation boom,Among the trials and tribulations of the plague years there was a silver lining In late 2020 with the approval of covid-19 vaccines and into 2021 as the jabs worked their magic techno-optimism began to spread If people could develop life-saving inoculations in months why couldn’t the world move out of its low-growth low-productivity slumber? Firms could embrace digitisation as never before; the shift to working from home could allow people free of office gossip and draining commutes to work more effectively; before long there would be vaccines for every disease imaginable Governments promised to spend big on science; companies outlined juicy r&d plans Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt was quite a change of mood In the years before the pandemic the rich world growth rate had drastically slowed In the 2010s American labour productivityoutput per hour of workgrew at half the pace of the decade before Societies had become worse at finding new ideas translating them into innovations and promulgating these innovations Robert Gordon “The Rise and Fall of American Growth” published in 2016 argued that there were fewer life-changing discoveries to be made In early 2020 a paper in the American Economic Review a leading journal made the case that even where there were ideas to be discovered they were getting harder to find The possibility that the dynamic had shifted was intoxicating and not just because it suggested that some good would come of the pandemic Productivity growth is the main driver of higher real wages As the supply side of the economy expanded inflation would become less of a problem And innovations would improve people lives in ways not captured in the economic data But our analysis comes to a depressing conclusion So far there is little sign that the global economy is getting more productiveOfficial statistics are unusually volatile because of lockdown disruptions see chart 1 In the second quarter of 2022 American gdp appeared to fall by 01% even as the number of Americans on payrolls rose by 13m Britain gdp fell by the same amount while employment rose by 150000 Both economies are thus producing less with more people working As a new paper by Mr Gordon of Northwestern University and Hassan Sayed of Princeton notes today weak productivity growth is the flipside of strong growth in 2020 Back then American firms fired their weakest workers boosting productivity Now they are rehiring them dragging it back downData published at higher frequencies support the notion that productivity growth remains poor A global purchasing-managers index pmi compiled by JPMorgan Chase a bank asks bosses about the state of the broader economy and their business A proxy for productivity derived from pmis which we calculate by subtracting the employment component of the index from the output component has in recent months actually fallen We find similar results when applying the same methodology to a real-time indicator of economic activity published by Goldman Sachs another bank see chart 2Why has the productivity boom failed to materialise? Optimists point out that investment spending is indeed roaring as predictedbut caution that the benefits will only be felt slowly There is often a lag of three to five years between higher business investment and productivity growth New research by Jason Draho of ubs another bank concludes that “starting in 2024 the rest of this decade could look more like the second half of the 1990s than the second half of the 1970s” Yet there are three reasons to worry that the pandemic innovation boom might never arriveThe first relates to investment Firms are not necessarily spending on things that lift productivity In recent months with customers facing empty shelves many have scrambled to expand and protect supply chains This improves resilience but by creating redundancy it also increases costs Many firms are also building up inventories or stocks of raw materials and finished goods Such spending counts towards investment as measured in the national accounts but has zero impact on productivity In Germany in late 2021 the build-up of inventories accounted for 9% of total investment the most ever Short-term crisis management has thus taken precedence over long-term innovation In America r&d spending remains high but our back-of-the-envelope calculation for 31 countries suggests that overall rich-world spending on “intellectual-property products” is running at about $3trn a yearbelow its pre-pandemic trend There is not much evidence of a boom in new discoveries and use of frontier technology In 2020 economists talked excitedly about the coming wave of automation as companies invested in AI and machine learning But American imports of robots in real terms are no higher than shortly before the pandemicThe second factor relates to working from home Almost overnight much of the rich world moved from the office to the kitchen table Many have stayed there: a third of paid full days in America are now done from home This is great for work-life balance But predictions that it would also help people work more efficiently which pre-pandemic studies had suggested are as yet unfulfilled A recent survey of economists in America and Europe found that they were “uncertain about the long-term impact on productivity” At home people might be able to focus more on “deep work”; they are also able to spend more time walking the dogIndeed in some instances the pandemic has introduced inefficienciesthe third factor Companies are still spending on extra cleaning and other measures to make people feel safer which will do little to raise profitability With wave after wave of covid workers are taking more sick days In early summer an astonishing 4m Americans said they were off work because they had the disease or were caring for somebody with it according to an official survey In Britain as people moved back to the office last year the share of working hours lost to sickness jumpedPerhaps at some point the rich world will enjoy the long-awaited productivity boom But adjusting for the volatility of the pandemic economy Messrs Gordon and Sayed find “no room for a pandemic-era revival in productivity growth as has been widely suggested” A large body of peer-reviewed evidence before the pandemic established that innovation had drastically slowedand explained the reasons why that was so Wishful thinking is not enough to change that All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hubFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 25th 2022,How to avoid energy rationing,Across europe two questions will set the political weather this winter How high will my energy prices go? And what will the government do to protect me? Attempting to shelter from the gathering storm French and Spanish politicians among others have already capped or otherwise lowered gas and electricity prices With wholesale gas futures for early 2023 still climbingup to more than €300 $299 per mwh from less than €30 last summerand Europe economic indicators blinking red more will follow suit That prospect is enough to drive economists to despairListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPoliticians want to protect voters from big bills but also need to cut energy use so as to avoid blackouts and reduce Russia oil-and-gas revenues Price caps help voters but do so inefficiently and reduce the incentive to cut energy use Until recently however economists would have said that their impact on fuel consumption was minor and their impact on gas consumption uncertain A body of research had found that consumers were largely unresponsive to higher petrol prices: they need to drive to work and will do so even if expensive In this analysis capping prices would not make a huge difference to energy consumptionYet a new batch of studies have overturned the conventional view suggesting prices really do matter The difference reflects a change in research methods The earlier generation of studies analysed aggregate data such as weekly sales and prices in a region not demand from individual consumers or even driving patterns This is a problem because crucial information gets lost when aggregating data A mild increase in the weekly average price could hide a drop at the start of the week If that drop encourages more demand an aggregate analysis might find that a higher price leads to more consumption not less And prices at the pump are not set in isolation They respond to demand making the price-demand relationship two-way Disentangling this is trickyMore recent research analysing micro data has produced striking results To assess how consumers react to higher petrol prices Laurence Levin of Visa a payments firm and co-authors looked at daily card transactions from 243 American cities in the late 2000s They found a sizeable response For a 10% rise in petrol prices consumption fell by about 3% They also showed that if they had used aggregate data they would have concluded there had been a much smaller drop Christopher Knittel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Shinsuke Tanaka of Tufts University used even more granular data looking at a Japanese fuel-economy app and found similar results with one extra detail: drivers not only responded to higher prices by driving less they also drove more carefully to save fuel Natural gas like petrol is also an essential good But here too new research finds that consumers cut back when prices are higher Maximilian Auffhammer of the University of California Berkeley and Edward Rubin of the University of Oregon looked at 300m energy bills in California In some parts of the golden state similar households are supplied by two different gas firms which employ different price-adjustment mechanismsproviding the researchers with something akin to the treatment and control groups that are often used in medical research They established that a 10% rise in gas prices led to an average 2% drop in consumption An interesting variation hid behind these figures During summer months there was hardly any response to prices; in winter households cut use by 4%California price changes were small compared with those Europe is facing How households respond to enormous price shocks has rarely been studied owing to a lack of real-world data One exception is that produced by Ukraine which Anna Alberini of the University of Maryland and co-authors have studied looking at price rises in 2015 after subsidies were cut They found that among households that did not invest in better heating or insulation a doubling of prices led to a 16% decline in consumptionPolicies to help households cope with high prices have also been studiedand the results are bad news for politicians capping prices In California where a government programme cut the marginal price of gas for poor households by 20% households raised their consumption by 85% over the next year to 18 months Ukraine has found a better way to help Households struggling to pay their bills can apply for a cash transfer Since such a transfer is unrelated to consumption it preserves the incentive for shorter showers and thus does not blunt the effect of high prices on gas use Another option is a halfway house between a price cap and a transfer An Austrian state recently introduced a discount on the first 80% of a typical household consumption which means people retain an incentive to cut back on anything over thatSpilt milkHouseholds are not the only consumers of gas Early in the war manufacturers and agricultural producers argued against doing anything that might risk supplies since production processes took time to alter and output losses could cascade through the economy But initial evidence from the German dairy and fertiliser industries suggests that even heavy users respond to higher prices Farmers have switched from gas to oil heating; ammonia fertiliser gas-intensive ingredient is now imported instead of being made locally Over time households and industry will adapt more to higher prices meaning that with every passing month demand for gas will fall If Europe politicians are serious about cutting gas use they should heed the latest research and avoid price caps There is even a self-interested case for doing so Without high prices to encourage households and industry to cut back on their energy consumption governments will have to find ways other than the price mechanism to allocate scarce resources Who wants to be the politician to have introduced rationing?

 Aug 24th 2022,Western sanctions will eventually impair Russia economy,When russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th “Oleg” a senior executive at a Russian airline braced for turbulence It did not take long to arrive Within days Western countries had barred his firm aircraft from entering their airspace They also prohibited exports of plane parts and semiconductors to Russia: a problem since three-quarters of the country commercial fleet comes from America Europe or Canada and parts are needed for repairs Many analysts predicted the industry would crash before the summer In fact airlines have managed to rotate their planes to keep viable routes open But they will not be able to defy gravity for ever Some are starting to cannibalise grounded aircraft for parts Oleg expects many planes to be unsafe to fly within a year or two Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe delayed but dangerous descent of Russian aviation illustrates the insidious power of Western sanctions Since February America and its allies have unleashed an unprecedented arsenal to try to squash Russia economy the world 11th largest hoping to stall the war effort prod people and plutocrats to protest and deter other foes namely China from similar escapades Some sanctions such as freezing the assets of Kremlin cronies are old tactics on a new scale Those meant to cut Russia from the financial systemthe exclusion of commercial banks from swift a messaging network and the immobilisation of $300bn in central-bank reservesare novel bazookas A third type comprehensive export bans had previously targeted single firms not an entire country Yet wave after wave of penaltiesthe eu passed its seventh package in Julyhave not razed Fortress Russia Meanwhile as gas prices rocket the sanctions’ political costs are mounting So is the West losing the economic war? Not quite As with the aviation industry it will take time for the damage to materialise Russia a country with low external debt and heaps of foreign-exchange reserves was always unlikely to succumb to a financial heart attack Even when sanctions are most successful such as when they forced Libya to abandon weapons of mass destruction in 2003 past regimes have taken years to work To assess how effective the West arsenal is proving The Economist has ranked a trio of measuresthe freezing of oligarch assets financial sanctions and trade restrictionson a scale from pretty useless to truly hurtful Our analysis suggests that they will in time start to seriously impair Russia economyThe least effective sanctions are those that have won the most publicity: the blacklisting of apparatchiks deemed close to the Kremlin World-Check a data firm reckons that 1455 members of Russia kleptocratic elite are now unable to travel to some or all Western countries or to access their possessions there or both The frozen assets comprise bank deposits and market securities held in escrow accounts at Western banks They also include must-have tycoon toys such as country cottages football clubs jewellery and yachts seized by live-streamed crews of policemen at rivieras around the planet Targeting oligarchs is an attractive approach for governments that need to be seen to be doing something It also gives Russia few direct means of retaliation Western moguls own little there; many American and European firms have already written off their Russian investments Accordingly Western enforcers are seeking greater powers to go after the Fabergé eggs America Department of Justice wants to use anti-mafia laws to liquidate the assets seized and give the proceeds to Ukraine The eu is proposing to make the violation of sanctions a crime which would toughen up enforcement across the bloc Yet most of the assets targeted by the West end up slipping through the net Anders Aslund a former adviser to the Russian and Ukrainian governments reckons that just $50bn out of $400bn of offshore assets that are blocked on paper has so far been frozen Oligarchs have hidden some of their offshore treasures behind as many as 30 layers of shell companies incorporated in the Cayman Islands Jersey and other havens with redacted disclosure documents in multiple languages Others keep a grip on assets they ostensibly no longer control by transferring ownership to kin or placing puppets on the board Missing the boatMeanwhile the enforcement of these sanctions is left to the private custodians of said assets from Swiss wealth managers to marinas in St Tropez which often lack the means or inclination to probe all that deeply Big banks often refuse to move funds on behalf of suspicious entities if they are found to be at least 25% controlled by designated Russians the legal threshold is 50% Yet smaller fintech and crypto firms are less diligent; companies supposed to monitor physical assets such as harbour managers are generally clueless A similar discrepancy exists between jurisdictions America recently scolded Switzerland and the uae where dozens of Russian-owned private jets are grounded in the desert for not doing enough to uncover sanction-evaders It is not clear that freezing such assets does much to hobble Russia economy anyway Most oligarchs hold little political influence A former Ukrainian energy boss reckons that Vladimir Putin Russia president is quite happy to see them taken down a notch Meanwhile efforts to confiscate the assets and send the proceeds to Ukraine have gone nowhereFinancial measures the second type of sanctions target the nerve centres of the Russian economy: commercial lenders and the central bank The former have faced a sliding scale of prohibitions since the invasion depending on their size and proximity to the Kremlin Capital-market sanctions the softest kind bar Western investors from buying or selling bonds or shares issued by 19 Russian banks Ten lenders including the two biggest by assets have been kicked out of swift which more than 11000 banks use globally for cross-border payments Twenty-six can no longer facilitate international transfers in American dollars after Uncle Sam banned its own banks from offering “correspondent-banking” services to them Such measures have bite Research by Stefan Goldbach and colleagues at the Bundesbank shows that between February 1st and April 30th the swift suspensions caused a near-total collapse of money transfers between the excluded Russian banks and the German branch of Target 2 the system for clearing payments between euro-zone banks Alternatives to swift such as telex are clunky and slow Bans on correspondent banking are powerful too Not only is the dollar used directly to settle about 40% of cross-border trade but it also serves as a staging post in many transactions involving second-tier currencies Now Russia must sometimes resort to barter a cumbersome and risky option Yet financial sanctions have failed to choke off most payments Banks that process Europe voluminous purchases of Russian fuel notably Gazprombank are still allowed to use swift Much of the rest is being channelled legally through smaller banks that remain connected to the network Doing without dollars is trickier India which has been guzzling Russian oil since February is still looking for a viable way to pay for it in rupees But a jump in payment volumes going through cips China home-grown swift from May to July suggests China is having more luck Trading volumes in the yuan-rouble pair on the Moscow exchange have reached records of late Freezing the reserves held by the Central Bank of Russia cbr in the West equal to about half of its $600bn-worth total stash has had similarly mixed results Within hours of the measure being announced the rouble value against the greenback which the central bank could no longer defend cratered by more than 30% see chart As the cbr cranked up interest rates to halt the fall from 95% to 20% domestic credit tightened hurting demand and pushing Russia into recession In June the sanctions also forced Russia into its first major foreign-debt default for more than a century after they prevented the central bank from processing $100m in payments due to bondholders Yet it took just a few weeks for the rouble to rebound allowing the cbr to slash rates fast to 8% on July 25th The official exchange rate does not reflect the true appetite for the currency: capital controls first imposed in the wake of the cbr freeze remain largely in place But it still points to a flaw in the West original plan While the cbr foreign stash of dollars and euros remains off-limits Russia earns fresh hard currency every day thanks to its giant oil-and-gas exports This means it does not need to borrow making its default largely inconsequential Which leaves trade restrictions another two-pronged measure Actions to curb Russia oil-export revenues which last year contributed 36% of its federal budget have received more attention than they deserve America no longer imports any Russian oil but it bought little in the first place The eu has pledged to stop buying seaborne crude oil from Russia in December and refined petroleum in February It is already buying a little less: a combined 24m barrels per day bpd in July against 29m before the war Most of those barrels however are being picked up by India and China albeit at a discount of around $25 relative to the price of Brent crude the global benchmark currently at $101 No embargo is planned on Russian gas which is harder to replace and brings in less than 10% of the Kremlin revenueWhether Russia is earning less now than it would without sanctions is debatable Rystad Energy a consultancy reckons it will lose up to $85bn in oil-and-gas tax income this year out of a potential bounty of $295bn because of the discount Then again it is partly the threat of a Western embargo that has kept global oil prices at such high levels Capital Economics another consultancy estimates that Russia has sold its oil at an average price of $85 per barrel since February higher than 90% of the time since 2014 And contrary to early expectations Russia is continuing to export nearly as much petroleum as it has in recent yearsMight that change when the eu import ban comes into force in the next few months? Finding new buyers to mop up the 24m bpd shunned by the bloc will be difficult Moreover from December 31st eu and British insurers which dominate the oil-shipping market will be barred from serving tankers carrying Russian cargo That could prove a big obstacle Many ports and canals may not allow ships through if the risk of oil spills is not covered Reid l’Anson of Kpler a data firm thinks such frictions will force Russia to cut production by 11m bpd by the end of 2022 equivalent to about 14% last year exportsYet there is already talk that Europe will delay its bans if the winter proves too harsh Commodity traders say that at such discounts there will always be buyers China and India may self-insure; Russia has said it will offer reinsurance If its oil exports really do dwindle the market is so tight that prices may jump nullifying the impact America realising this is trying to convince its allies to impose a price cap on Russian oilsomething which could prove hard to implement Shadowy traders in Bahrain or Dubai may cheat to secure bigger volumes Russia may retaliate by withholding oil for a short period provoking a price spike and putting pressure on the West to back downLet the chips fallThe most potent sanctions are in fact the least discussed: export controls In successive salvos since February Western governments have made it compulsory for a range of domestic industries to seek licences before selling to Russia and they are rarely granted The restrictions go well beyond “dual-use” productsthose with both military and commercial applications like drones and lasersto cover advanced kit such as chips computers software and energy equipment They also target low-tech goods such as chemicals and commodities that are usually restricted only if set for Iran or North Korea The breadth of such sanctions is remarkable What makes America particularly vicious however is the “Foreign Direct Product Rule” fdpr which extends the controls not just to products made in the United States but also to foreign ones made using American software and tools or containing American inputs When America pioneered the fdpr in 2020 to prevent Huawei a Chinese telecoms giant it suspected of spying from acquiring advanced semiconductors it hammered the firm even though plants in America account for just 15% of global chipmaking capacity This time America claims that global chip exports to Russia are down 90% from last yearThat is bad news for the country manufacturing sector which needs imported inputs Mr Putin has worked hard since 2014 to insulate Russia financial system against Western sanctionsby de-dollarising its trade diversifying its central-bank reserves and developing home-grown payment networksbut the same is not true of the country industry which up until the war began remained woven into the global trading order even if less so than other countries Chips and other electronic components from 70 different American and European firms have been found in Russian weaponry Other industries from mining to transport require foreign parts and expertise to carry out maintenance A German supplier to the Moscow metro reckons that if it stopped providing servicing the network would see disruptions within a month and be paralysed after three Russia also needs nifty software and hardware to develop new products from consumer electronics to electric cars Some effects are already visible even though export controls kicked in late most had a one-to-three-month grace period Manufacturing output fell by 7% between December and June led by carmaking a 90% fall pharma 25% and electrical equipment 15% In May Russia eased safety standards to allow for the production of cars without airbags and anti-lock brakes A lack of high-tech kit has hampered Russia 5g roll-out The country cloud-computing champions such as Yandex an internet firm and Sberbank a lender are struggling to expand data centres The chip shortage is hindering new plastic-card issuance on mir the domestic payment system A lack of specialised vessels may hobble Russia Arctic drilling plans; a dearth of foreign technology and know-how could even slow down old-school oil-and-gas extraction Basic industries such as the mining and refining of metals have slumped too Russia is trying to fight back Previously it tapped the unauthorised grey market to source sensitive Western tech and military kit often from resellers in Asia and Africa In June it went further by legalising “parallel” imports allowing Russian firms to bring in goods such as servers and phones without the trademark holder consent Artem Starosiek of Molfar a Ukrainian intelligence firm says there has been a boom in “credit-card tourism” as tour operators that once organised covid-vaccine trips for Russians now fly them to buy Visa-issued cards in Uzbekistan Trade between Western countries and Russia neighbours such as Georgia and Kazakhstan has grown rapidly since the invasion Yet it is hard for an entire economy to be run on smuggled goods especially when some of them are scarce everywhere Chinese firms which usually supply a quarter of Russia imports have been slow to help since they too fear losing access to essential Western parts Even Huawei has curtailed its links with Russia The shortages will therefore last with their effects compounding over time as wear and tear takes its toll and the rot spreads from one industry to the next The result will be a slow grinding degradation of Russia economyThis degradation will be compounded by the sanctions’ less tangible effects Konstantin Sonin of the University of Chicago reckons several hundreds of thousands of Russiansmany of them highly skilledhave left the country since the invasion More than 1200 foreign firms have also pledged to leave according to scholars at Yale University The imf forecasts that the country growth rate in 2025-26 will have fallen by roughly half compared with estimates from before the outbreak of war So long as America and its allies maintain their sanctions Russia industrial backbone intellectual brawn and international links will fade and its future will be one of sagging productivity little innovation and structural inflation Economists were wrong to predict an instant crash What Russia is getting instead is a one-way ticket to nowhere Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

others are shifting assets out of the country In the first quarter of 2022 the latest available data foreigners pulled out $15bn-worth of direct investment easily the worst figure on record In May 2022 Russian remittances to Georgia were an astonishing ten times higher in dollar terms than the year before But The Economist analysis of data from a wide variety of sources suggests that Russia economy is doing better than even the most upbeat forecasts predicted as sales of hydrocarbons have fuelled a record current-account surplus Take for example a “current-activity indicator” published by Goldman Sachs a bank a real-time measure of economic growth see chart 1 This declined dramatically in March and April if not on a scale comparable with the global financial crisis of 2007-09 or even the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 In subsequent months it has recoveredOther measures tell a similar story: of a recession but not a deep one at least by Russia volatile standards see chart 2 In June industrial production was 18% down on a year earlier according to a paper published by JPMorgan Chase another bank An index of service-sector growth compiled by sending surveys to managers shows a smaller hit than during previous crises Electricity consumption seems to be growing again after an initial decline The number of railway loadings a proxy for goods demand is holding up Meanwhile inflation is easing From the start of 2022 to the end of May consumer prices rose by about 10% The fall in the rouble made imports dearer; the withdrawal of Western companies cut supply But prices are now falling according to Rosstat An independent source published by State Street Global Markets a consultancy and PriceStats a data firm derived from online prices shows similar trends In its public statements the cbr now worries about falling prices as well as inflation A stronger rouble has cut the cost of imports And Russians’ inflation expectations have fallen A data set from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University shows expected inflation over the next year has dropped from 176% in March to 11% in July see chart 3 With plentiful gas Russia is also unlikely to see a European-style surge in inflation produced by higher energy pricesFalling prices are not the only thing helping households True the unemployment rate at an all-time low of 39% in June is misleading Many companies have furloughed staff some without pay in order to avoid registering redundancies But there is not much evidence of a jobs calamity Data from HeadHunter a Russian jobs site suggest that the economy-wide ratio of jobseekers to vacancies rose from 38 in January to 59 in Maymaking it harder to find a job than beforeand then fell back a bit Data from Sberbank Russia largest lender indicate that median real wages have sharply increased since the spring In part because the labour market is holding up people can keep spending Sberbank data suggest that in July real consumer spending was pretty much unchanged from the start of the year Imports fell in the spring partly because many Western firms stopped supplying them Yet the decline was not severe by the standards of recent recessions and imports are now bouncing back fast see chart 4Three factors explain why Russia keeps beating the forecasts The first is policy Vladimir Putin has little understanding of economics but he is happy to delegate economic management to people who do The cbr is stuffed with highly qualified wonks who took swift action to prevent economic collapse The doubling of interest rates in February in combination with capital controls shored up the rouble helping to cut inflation The general public know that Elvira Nabiullina the bank governor is serious about keeping a lid on prices even if this does not make her a popular figureThe second factor relates to recent economic history Sergei Shoigu Russia defence minister may have been on to something in February when according to the Washington Post he told the British government that Russians “can suffer like no one else” This is the fifth economic crisis the country has faced in 25 years after 1998 2008 2014 and 2020 Anyone older than 40 has memories of the extraordinary economic tumult brought about by the fall of the Soviet Union People have learned to adapt rather than panic or revolt Parts of Russia economy have long been fairly detached from the West That comes at the cost of lower growth but it has made the recent increase in isolation less painful In 2019 the stock of foreign direct investment in the country was worth about 30% of gdp compared with the global average of 49% Before the invasion only about 03% of Russians with a job worked for an American firm compared with more than 2% across the rich world The country requires relatively few foreign supplies of raw materials Thus the extra isolation has not had much of an impact on the figures to dateThe third factor relates to hydrocarbons Sanctions have had a limited impact on Russian oil output according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency Since the invasion Russia has sold in the region of $85bn-worth of fossil fuels to the eu The way in which Russia spends the foreign currency thus accumulated is something of a mystery given sanctions on the government There is little doubt though that these sales are helping Russia to continue to buy importsnot to mention pay soldiers and buy weaponsUntil Mr Putin leaves office Western investors will be reluctant to touch Russia Sanctions will remain The cbr acknowledges that while Russia does not rely much on foreign materials it is desperate for foreign machinery Over time sanctions will take a toll and Russia will produce goods of a worse quality at a higher cost But for now its economy is stumbling along Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

 Aug 18th 2022,Does unemployment really have to rise to bring down inflation?,Rarely in america past has an inflation rate of 85% felt so good In July for the first time since May 2020 consumer prices did not rise from one month to the nextthough the year-on-year rate of increase remained highthanks to a sharp drop in energy prices But officials at the Federal Reserve are not celebrating From their perspective the inflation problem remains unresolved as long as rapid growth in workers’ wages continues to power a spending boom While that remains the case a drop in the price of any one thing such as oil only leaves more room for spending on another The Fed thus needs to weaken workers’ bargaining positions by introducing a bit of slack into the labour market Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet what counts as slack is very much up for debate In its broad outlines the concept is clear enough It represents a supply of workers in excess of labour demand: too many people chasing too little employment Under such conditions firms do not need to work very hard to lure or retain workers and pay packets thus grow slowly if at all At present there does not seem to be much slack about In the three months to July the hourly wage of the typical American worker rose at an annual rate of almost 7%nearly double the fastest pace reached in the 2010s This rather than dear oil or soaring rents is what most troubles the Fed and what it seeks to address through higher interest ratesEconomists disagree however about how much give must be introduced into labour markets and where Much of the recent argument has focused on the level of job openings relative to the number of unemployed workers a ratio that has been near its record high for most of the past year Given that many firms are scrapping to hire from a tiny pool of available workers it comes as little surprise that wage offers are rocketing Yet some Fed officials argue that precisely because the number of job vacancies is so high it may be possible to introduce slack into the labour market through reductions in the number of posted openingswithout having to push millions of people out of work In July Chris Waller a Federal Reserve governor and Andrew Figura also of the Fed published a paper making this case noting that the relationship between vacancies and unemployment may at current levels be a very steep one such that tapping the monetary brakes yields a little extra unemployment but a big drop in openings which hampers workers’ ability to move to higher-paying jobs Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has also expressed similar viewsOther economists are unconvinced A recent analysis published by Alex Domash and Larry Summers of Harvard University and Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank noted that there has never before been a large drop in the number of job openings that has not coincided with a meaningful rise in unemployment This makes sense: conditions that deter some firms from advertising for new workers may well lead other employers to lay off staff But given that vacancies are in uncharted territory it is hard to know whether such historical rules of thumb apply And since March at least the number of job openings in America has fallen by nearly 10% even as the unemployment rate droppedThere are other places apart from the balance between job openings and unemployment to look for more slack An increase in labour supply either through increases in average hours worked or through the entrance of more people into the workforce could have the effect of bringing down wage growth without unemployment having to go up In a new paper David Blanchflower and Jackson Spurling of Dartmouth College and Alex Bryson of University College London suggest that in the years since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 these potential sources of labour supply have been more important in shaping wage growth than either the level of unemployment or the number of job vacancies At present American data for both hours worked and labour-force participation seem to show room for improvement The number of average hours worked per employee is at roughly the level of the mid-2010s and has actually fallen since the beginning of this year; it could easily go higher Perhaps more important rates of labour-force participation remain subdued Indeed among “prime-age” adults those 25-54-years-old the share of the population now working is currently a little lower than it was immediately before the covid-19 pandemic and nearly two percentage points lower than the peak reached in 2000 There are seemingly more hours that could be worked by more peoplea situation that certainly seems to meet the definition of slackDroops to conquerYet a lot hangs on whether those who left the workforce during the worst of the pandemic decide to return Some people for instance may have retired permanently Others might be enticed back in by heady wage growth and could eventually add to slack Research published last year by Bart Hobijn of Arizona State University and Aysegul Sahin of the University of Texas finds that participation tends to keep rising several months after the unemployment rate hits a bottom which it is yet to do If such a rise were to coincide with falling vacancies wage growth could be checked without unemployment going up Indeed in the late 2010s pay stagnated amid an improving economy and falling unemployment thanks to precisely this confluence of events Yet a pessimist might point out that if anything America labour-force participation has been falling in recent months rather than rising So far at least rapid wage growth has not proved to be very tempting Moreover having allowed inflation to get so far out of hand the Fed may now feel bound to push unemployment up rather than hoping for the emergence of less certain forms of slack It may in other words be unwilling to cut optimistic interpretations any slack Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:America v Europe: A comparison of riches leaves both sides red-faced Aug 13thHow high property prices can damage the economy Jul 30thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 17th 2022,Can the Visa-Mastercard duopoly be broken?,“It like vegas” says Matt Moore the owner of a small bike shop in Georgetown a neighbourhood in Washington “You know you’re going to get screwed the only question is how to get screwed the least” The system of interchangewhereby banks and credit-card issuers charge merchants for collecting paymentsis loathed by many retailers Merchants hand over $138bn in fees each year; according to the National Retail Federation a lobby group it is their second-biggest cost after wages And while shoppers are less likely to have strong feelings about the system being mostly unaware of it they also suffer as a result of higher sticker prices Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAmerica is home to the heftiest interchange fees of any major economycosts are an order of magnitude greater than in Europe and China That largely benefits two firms: Visa and Mastercard which facilitate more than three-quarters of the country credit-card transactions Doing so has made them two of the most profitable companies in the world with net margins last year of 51% and 46% respectively Rank every firm excluding real-estate-investment trusts in the s&p 500 index by their average net-profit margins last year five years ago and a decade ago and only four appear in the top 20 every time Two are financial-information firms Intercontinental Exchange and the cme Group The others are Mastercard and Visa At first glance their position appears insurmountable Already dominant in recent years the firms have been boosted by a covid-induced rise in online shopping American consumers used credit or debit cards for 45% of their transactions in 2016; by 2021 that had reached 57% The migration from cash is “a significant and long-running tailwind” says Craig Vosburg of Mastercard Yet two threats loom The first comes from Washington where legislators hope to smash the duo grip on payments The second is virtual Payments have been transformed in Brazil China and Indonesia by cheap convenient app-based options from tech giants like Mercado Pago Ant Group Tencent and Grab After a long wait new entrants now look like they could shake up America marketThat would be good news for consumers and retailers Much of Visa and Mastercard profits are ultimately driven by the fees that are charged when a shopper uses a credit or debit card to make a purchase The eu has capped such fees for credit cards at 03% of the transaction value; intense competition in China means that WeChat and Alipay collect charges of just 01% In America debit cards are regulated by the “Durbin amendment” which gives the Federal Reserve the authority to enforce a cap But credit-card fees are unregulated and meatier usually sitting at about 2% of the transaction and rising to 35% for some premium-reward cards These fees are set by Mastercard and Visa but collected by banks which take a slice and use them to fund perks such as insurance and air miles to entice customers For the right to use the card networks’ transaction-processing services banks hand over enormous fees The result is that consumers pay through the nose for their perks while remaining largely oblivious According to a paper published last year by Joanna Stavins of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and colleagues retailers raise prices at the tills by 14% passing interchange costs on to households Poor Americans fare the worst High fees are built into the price of goods and prices are typically the same whether you pay with card or cash which the poor are more likely to use “The way to think about it is if you are not getting your points you are essentially funding everyone else” says Brian Kelly more commonly known as “the points guy” who has forged an entire business out of encouraging people to use perks Households with an annual income of less than $25000 roughly a quarter of the total number on average get no net rewards since any they do receive are entirely offset by fees Households that bring in more than $135000 a year recoup in points or perks around 06 percentage points of the interchange fees they pay These fees do fund some benefits not least the sort of consumer protection that is provided by regulators or legislators elsewhere In Europe for instance regulation ensures that customers can return goods especially faulty ones or that airlines compensate delayed passengers In America card networks have stepped into the breach They offer consumers the ability to “charge-back”reverse their approval for a settled transactionif something is not delivered as described Card networks also use the fees to keep payment systems secure and free from fraud In short Americans rely more on capitalism and competition to protect consumers rather than legislation and regulation“I certainly would not eliminate credit cards because they work great they are convenient and people love them” says Ms Stavins Instead she would like costs to be passed on: “If you come to the checkout and you want to use a credit card you would pay $103 for a $100 item” That way consumers would pay for the benefits but only if they truly value them Such a solution used to be impossible: in their agreements with merchants the card networks explicitly banned the addition of such surcharges But a class-action lawsuit that was first settled in 2013 forced Visa and Mastercard to permit merchants to impose a surcharge Subsequent lawsuits have overturned state laws banning surcharges Even though adding surcharges is now permitted and legal it is still difficult “When we talk to merchants a lot of them do not even know whether it is a plain card or a reward card so they do not know what their processing cost is until they get their monthly bill” says Ms Stavins It would be a technological nightmare to implement a system that accounted for all the different interchange rates It would also be off-putting for customers Typically businesses that do surcharge are those such as petrol stations or government enterprises where consumers struggle to go elsewhereThat might explain why legislators are eyeing up credit cards On July 28th Richard Durbin the same Democratic senator who regulated debit interchange a decade ago introduced the Credit Card Competition Act ccc It does not propose a cap on interchange as the debit rule does since costs for credit cards are more variable than for debit cards making it harder to find the right level Instead the ccc would attempt to spur competition by breaking the links between card networks and banks At present when a bank issues a credit card every transaction on it is processed by the card network the bank stipulates meaning the bank is guaranteed the interchange fee the network sets If the ccc becomes law it will force banks to offer merchants the choice of at least two different card networks Crucially these choices could not be the two biggestat least one smaller network would have to be offered They could compete for business by offering lower interchange rates and merchants would presumably jump at the offer The credit-card firms defend the existing system arguing that consumers and merchants derive value from it because it helps guarantee payments for merchants and protect consumers against fraud Thus shoppers have more purchasing power than would otherwise have been the case Two factors help the bill chances It is sponsored by Mr Durbin the second-most senior Democrat in the Senate and it is bipartisan co-sponsored by Roger Marshall a Republican from Kansas The ccc best chance is probably as an amendment to another bigger piece of legislation which is how debit-card regulation passed in 2010 Even if the effort fails or fails to work as intended a potentially bigger threat to the giants looms So far new entrants to the payments market have benefited Visa and Mastercard by making it easier for consumers to use their cards online But as the new fintechs have gained clout their decisions about the sorts of payments they offer could influence how much money travels along the card networks Stripe a large payments-infrastructure firm says it is working to provide merchants with payment methods that will lower their costs Current options include a box for customers to enter card details but also Klarna a “buy-now-pay-later” provider through which customers can pay for purchases using bank transfers thus avoiding the card networks It could soon include things like FedNow a real-time bank-transfer system being built by the Fed which is due to be launched next year In time it could even include central-bank digital currencies or cryptocurrencies Competitors might make little headway if the perks for sticking with credit cards are sufficiently juicy But merchants can offer their own incentives When your correspondent recently went to purchase a pair of linen trousers from Everlane an online retailer she was encouraged to pay using Catch a fintech app The app linked to her bank account via another payment startup called Plaid As a thank you for avoiding the card networks Everlane offered a shop credit worth 5% of the transaction value Catch has signed up a handful of fashionable millennial brands including Pacsun another clothing retailer and Farmacy a skincare firm For evidence that this poses a threat look no further than Visa attempted purchase of Plaid In 2020 the firm tried to buy the upstart for $53bn only for the deal to be scuppered by antitrust regulators on the grounds that the transaction would have allowed Visa to eliminate a competitive threat

 Aug 16th 2022,Xi Jinping economic revolution aims to spread growth,To get a cup of milk tea from Chayan Yuese in the central Chinese city of Changsha you may have to queue for an hour in the sweltering heat The local company known in English as “Sexy Tea” has become a national sensation Patrons insist that its method of steeping tea leaves and its ratio of water to milk produce a mellow brew that helps wash down fiery pepper-laden local dishes Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is part of what has made Changsha a wanghong hotspot or a place where young people come to shoot videos for social media Street vendors serving up spicy crayfish have become internet celebrities Crowds throng the city central shopping districts and eateries into the early hours of the morning despite worries about covid-19 The local television station has become something akin to the Netflix of China Chinese social media teems with photographs of young women dressed in swanky outfits posing in front of the city 32-metre-high granite bust of Mao Zedong the country revolutionary leader who came from a nearby townChina recent development has concentrated wealth in eastern cities Now President Xi Jinping wants to spread it inland to places like Changsha and wants the process to be driven by innovation in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence ai cloud computing and smart manufacturing“industrialisation 40” in his words Central-government directives often seem far removed from real business activity They are filled with lofty slogans and long-winded references to the importance of “Xi Jinping Thought” Changsha offers a snapshot of how Mr Xi revolution is actually playing outThe city is one of 15 urban centres that is trying to make the leap into the country elite Together they are known as “new first-tier” cities and already account for about a fifth of China gdp In Changsha the local government is happy to have a wanghong economy: planners want to make the city a centre for culture and tourism that brings in 500bn yuan $74bn in revenues a year up from less than 200bn in 2021 They hope fashionable tea shops will also help with a much bigger challenge and the main focus of their growth strategy: upgrading the city industrial base That will mean attracting a horde of new companies and talented people to a region hundreds of kilometres from wealthy coastal areas Changsha strong but old-fashioned industrial base makes it typical of the new first tier: industry drove rapid growth in the early 2000s but in the years since Changsha performance has converged with the Chinese average see chart The city is home to China two largest construction-machinery firms Sany and Zoomlion Another firm bsb is one of the country biggest specialists in prefabricated construction In a city just south of Changsha is one of the main manufacturing hubs of crrc China state-owned rail outfit These distinct specialties mean it should not have to compete head-on with neighbouring cities such as Chengdu which has a big aircraft-manufacturing base says Wang Tao of ubs a bank and a native of ChangshaThe first challenge planners face is upgrading the city existing industry through digitisation and automation The government has handed out large subsidies to encourage internet-technology companies to cluster around existing machinery building and transport firms Thousands of automation-related firms have been set up as a result Officials are monitoring what happens next One recent reform in industrial parks measures the amount of tax companies pay per mu 006 hectares of land they occupy and will eventually push out low payersIndustrial upgrades often involve integrating brand-new systems5g internet or ai-powered logisticsinto legacy firms in order to help boost efficiency note analysts at Jefferies an investment bank Baosight a state-owned industrial-digitisation giant has helped do this at many steel plants These sorts of changes can take years and require large experienced technology providers But most of the companies working in Changsha are small The city is not home to any large tech firms which are mainly based in China eastern cities Even some neighbouring industrial hubs such as Chongqing and Chengdu score better on this front This ultimately means the pace of industrial digitisation will be slower in Changsha says Xu Dihong the founder of Cadstar a local industrial-software companyThe second challenge is to hasten a boom in new tech companies Like several neighbouring cities Changsha is hurrying to build ai and smart-manufacturing parks; last year the Ministry of Science and Technology announced that it would build a national ai innovation zone in the city Some 5180 firms claiming to offer ai-related services were set up in Changsha in the first seven months of 2022 up from about 3000 in all of 2021 according to Qichacha a corporate-intelligence firm The trend has been mirrored across inland Chinese cities Whether this reflects genuine tech entrepreneurialism is doubtful; experts believe many of the new ai firms do little in the way of real innovationA burgeoning tech hub also needs a steady supply of talent In April the local government announced a list of 45 measures aimed at coaxing young professionals to the city including grants of up to 100m yuan for top scientists and tech organisations The cheapness of the city wanghong lifestyle is another draw Changsha has some of the lowest house prices of any large city in the country making it especially attractive to young entrepreneurs “A family can get twice the space in a flat here compared with a coastal city” says Mr Xu The milk tea and late-night dining on crayfish do not hurt either Yet they may not be enough Wang Peng of Huijiang Automation Technology a tech firm that set up an office in Changsha last year says that despite the generous incentives it is still hard to hire the right people Even established tech hubs such as Suzhou and Shenzhen face shortages of talented staff The city also has few international links Its location deep in China interior has made it difficult to bring in the highest level of talent especially Chinese people returning from university or work abroad says a professor at a local university It is a problem that could prevent many of the new first-tier cities making the leap to the very top For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Aug 11th 2022,America v Europe: A comparison of riches leaves both sides red-faced,When david hockney mother visited the British artist in Los Angeles she made an observation that points to the difficulties with transatlantic economic comparisons “Strange” she said after a couple of days in the sun “all this lovely weather and you never see any washing out” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is an observation many European visitors have echoed American travellers to Europe meanwhile often despair at washer-dryer machines that leave clothes damp Indeed for some American writers the lack of standalone dryers is symbolic of the continent backwardness While economic statistics should solve such debatesby allowing for apples-to-apples comparisonsthey are not immune to the problems posed by cultural differences Is it that Europeans cannot afford proper tumble dryers? Or are they simply getting their “drying services” free of charge?Questions like these are important when comparing countries On the surface America has by far the best case for prosperity Gross domestic product gdp per person is almost $70000 The only European countries where it is higher are Luxembourg Switzerland Norway and Ireland where figures are distorted by firms’ profit shifting In Germany Europe economic powerhouse gdp per person adjusted for purchasing-power parity is $58000 That puts it level with Vermont but far below New York $93000 and California $86000 The comparisons are even less flattering for other European countries Incomes in Britain and France are equal to those in Mississippi $42000 America poorest state Yet a lot is hidden by these figures To understand why consider how they are calculated Spending is deflated by some measure of price to allow accurate comparisons between countries of the amount of goods and services purchased For manufactured goods this is a straightforward calculation: the amount Americans spend on dryers divided by an index of their cost will give a pretty accurate figure for total consumptionFor services it is harder to work out a reasonable deflator And that matters because it is here rather than household appliances where Europe and America differ most Combined spending on health care housing and finance accounts for about half the difference in consumption between America and the biggest European economies In 2019 Americans consumed $12000-worth of health services per person; Germans managed just $7000The difficulty in working out a reasonable deflator is partly conceptual What are people paying for when they buy health care a service or an outcome? Is a unit of “health-care services” the cost of a specific treatment or the cost of health? What does being healthy even mean? International price indices simply and a little unsatisfactorily calculate the price per treatment These differ substantially The oecd a club of mostly rich countries estimates that a hip replacement in Norway costs seven times as much as one in Latvia and Lithuania In any case while American prices are higher than European ones the gap is not big enough to account for the difference in health-care consumption: Americans also undergo lots more medical treatmentSimon Kuznets a Nobel-prize-winning economist and statistician suggested estimates of gdp should exclude things an “enlightened social philosophy” would consider harms rather than benefits For him that included weapons advertising much of finance and anything necessary to “overcome difficulties that are properly speaking costs implicit in our economic civilisation”Many Europeans would suggest this category rightfully includes American health-care spending Life expectancy in America is five years lower than in Italy; lots of money is spent fixing the damage done by higher levels of violent crime traffic accidents and obesity Follow Kuznets adviceby removing from the calculation finance health public administration and defence spendingand the gap between America and Germany in gdp per hour worked drops from $11 to just $4 Much of the remaining gap is accounted for by “housing services” a category of consumption similarly bedevilled by conceptual difficulties International comparisons are done on the basis of the rental cost per square metre That flatters sparsely populated America and its sprawling cities where rents are generally cheaper While nearly everyone would rather have a bigger house preferences for suburban over urban living are hardly universalTop dollarThere are diminishing returns to America spending on health care But treating all of it as an additional cost would be a mistake Cancer survival rates are higher in America than Europe Health-care spending can be considered a luxury good that a richer country may choose to spend more on Germany Norway and Switzerland spend the most in Europe Meanwhile as American defence hawks like to point out Europe low military spending is possible only thanks to America largesse and the security it provides America has other genuine advantages The combination of higher productivity and the fact that workers spend more time at work allows Americans to enjoy greater quantities of consumer electronics cars furniture and clothes The only categories in which Germans and the French consistently consume more are education spending abroad and food and drink suggesting there is something to stereotypes of Europe cosmopolitan café culture and America infatuation with consumer goods Still while arguments can be made for Europe there is no way of slicing the data despite your columnist best efforts to make the continent biggest economies richer than America Even in the areas where Europe does consume more than America the old-world economies are not ahead by much Maybe the true lesson of the comparison is that neither side ought to be satisfied: Europeans should be unhappy with their lower incomes; Americans really should be getting a lot more from their riches Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 30thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 11th 2022,How should investors prepare for repeat inflation shocks?,Buy stocks so you can dream buy bonds so you can sleepor so the saying goes A wise investor will aim to maximise their returns relative to risk defined as volatility in the rate of return and therefore hold some investments that will do well in good times and some in bad Stocks surge when the economy soars; bonds climb during a crisis A mix of the twooften 60% stocks and 40% bondsshould help investors earn a nice return without too much risk Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSuch a mix has been a sensible strategy for much of the past two decades Since 2000 the average correlation between American stocks and Treasuries has been staunchly negative at -05 But the recent rout in both stock and bond prices has wrong-footed investors In the first half of the year the s&p 500 shed 206% and an aggregate measure of the price of Treasuries lost 86% Is this an aberration or the new normal?The answer depends on whether higher inflation is here to stay When economic growth drives asset prices stocks and bonds diverge When inflation drives them stocks and bonds often move in tandem On August 10th American inflation data showed prices did not rise in July Stocks soaredthe s&p 500 rose by 21%and short-term Treasury prices climbed too For as long as central bankers kept a lid on inflation investors were protected Yet look back before 2000 to a period when inflation was more common and you see that stocks and bonds frequently moved in the same direction aqr Capital Management an investment firm notes that in the 20th century the correlation between stocks and bonds was more often positive than negativeLots of hedge-fund types pension-fund managers and private-equity barons are therefore worrying about the potential for repeat inflation shocks Last year the debate in the halls of finance was about whether inflation would be “transitory” or “persistent”; this year it is about whether it is “cyclical” or “structural”At the heart of this is not whether central bankers can bring down prices but whether the underlying inflation dynamic has changed Those in the “structural” camp argue that the recent period of low inflation was an accident of historyhelped by relatively calm energy markets globalisation and Chinese demographics which pushed down goods prices by lowering the cost of labour These tailwinds have turned Covid-19 messed up supply chains; war and sabre-rattling are undermining globalisation Manoj Pradhan formerly of Morgan Stanley points out that China working-age population has peaked Jeremy Grantham a bearish hedge-fund investor fears that the switch to renewables will be slow and costly and that lower investment in fossil-fuel production will make it hard for energy firms to ramp up supply increasing the risk of energy-price spikes All this the structuralists argue means the current inflation shock is likely to be the first of many: central bankers will be playing whack-a-mole for a while yet Recurrent inflation would upend 20 years of portfolio-management strategy If the correlation between stocks and bonds shifts from -05 to +05 the volatility of a “60/40” portfolio increases by around 20% In a bid to avoid being wrong-footed once again investors are updating their plans As Barry Gill of ubs asset-management arm puts it the task is “to realign your portfolio around this new reality” What assets will allow investors to sleep soundly in this new reality? Cryptocurrencies once looked like an interesting hedge but this year they have fallen and risen in lockstep with stocks A recent paper by kkr a private asset-management firm argues perhaps unsurprisingly that illiquid alternatives like private equity and credit are a good way to diversify But that may be an illusion: illiquid assets are rarely marked-to-market and are exposed to the same underlying economic forces as stocks and bonds There are other options aqr suggests stock-picking strategies where success has little to do with broader economic conditions such as “long-short” equity investing going long on one firm and short on another Meanwhile commodities are the natural choice for those worried about a disorderly green transition since a basket of them appears to be uncorrelated with stocks and bonds over long periods In the search for new ways to minimise risk investors dreaming of high returns will have to get creative That at least should tire them out by the end of the dayRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Reminiscences of a financial columnist Jul 28th The Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdWhy markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 9th 2022,China mortgage boycotts are a symptom of a broader crisis,The german mathematician David Hilbert once imagined a hotel with an infinite number of rooms Even if all of the rooms were occupied he pointed out the hotel could accommodate a new arrival simply by asking each guest to move into the room next door One guest would move into a second guest room freeing up a spot for the new arrival The second guest would move into a third guest room and so on With an infinite number of rooms the sequence would never endListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor years China property developers operated along similar lines They would sell flats far in advance of building them The money raised for these flats was supposedly reserved for building them just as each room in Hilbert hotel was supposedly reserved for an existing guest But developers would instead use the money for other purposes such as buying land When the time came to pay for construction they would sell more unbuilt flats and use that money instead Just as Hilbert hotel accommodated each guest in the room next door China property developers built each pre-sold flat with the money from the next pre-sale As long as there were always new buyers the sequence could go onUnfortunately China developers are now running out of rooms Their sales in the 12 months to June fell by 22% compared with the previous 12 months Advance sales fell even faster see chart This painful brush with finitude has left many developers without enough cash to continue building the flats their customers have already bought China developers have started work on over 6bn square metres of property in the past three years They have completed less than half that amount In the past homebuyers could do little about these delays They had already handed over their money after allBut although they have paid their developers they are still paying their banks In recent months angry homebuyers have threatened to stop repaying their mortgages if developers do not resume work on their flats According to a crowdsourced document circulating online this mortgage strike has spread to nearly 100 cities and over 320 projects including a Dragon City a Peacock City and a Phoenix City Over 40 of these projects are in Zhengzhou the capital of Henan provinceHow widespread could boycotts become? There are some limits to their growth Striking mortgage-holders could end up on credit blacklists damaging their access to loans And in China points out s&p Global a ratings agency most individuals cannot declare bankruptcy since “their debts will never be forgiven”In a gloomy scenario mortgage loans worth about 24trn yuan $350bn could turn sour reckons s&p Global That amounts to roughly 13% of total bank loans enough to endanger some smaller lenders but not enough to pose a systemic threat to the banking systemThe true significance of the boycotts lies elsewhere They show that Chinese households no longer believe that a flat bought in advance will necessarily be delivered This loss of faith is not confined to the protesters It is also showing up in weakening pre-sales especially for distressed developers A reluctance to buy new homes poses a bigger threat to China economy than the more conspicuous refusal to repay existing mortgages Weak sales will further squeeze the revenues of developers adding to construction delays and deepening disillusionmentHow can this vicious circle be broken? In Henan two state-owned enterprises a developer and a “bad bank” have set up a relief fund to acquire distressed projects and see them through to completion But China local governments lack the cash to revive confidence according to Andrew Batson of Gavekal Dragonomics a research firm He believes a credible plan will require the central government to step in It is understandably reluctant to plough more resources into a sector that already commands too big a share of the economy But new money invested in stalled projects could yield a double dividend helping both to build unfinished flats and to rebuild confidence in pre-salesIn the longer term China developers need a less frenetic business model They will have to rely less on selling flats in advance and starting the next project before finishing the last In China the demand for housing is vast But it is not infinite For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 7th 2022,An oil windfall offers Gulf states one last chance to splurge,In the north-western corner of Saudi Arabia not far from the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba sits a patch of mostly bare desertthe ostensible location of Neom This would-be city is intended to be a bold step into the future and the showpiece of the kingdom attempt to diversify its economy away from oil There has been talk of robots doing menial work beaches lined with crushed marble and fleets of drones forming an artificial moon One recent whim is to create the world longest buildings; like skyscrapers laid flat these self-contained ecosystems would stretch for more than 100 miles Estimates suggest the city could cost as much as $500bnListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen this wild dream was first unveiled in 2017 financing it seemed near impossible Now a torrent of oil money may allow Saudi Arabia to get things rolling The world economy recovery from covid-19 and Russia invasion of Ukraine have pushed up oil prices triggering a staggering transfer of wealth from global consumers to fuel-exporting countries From January to June the price of a barrel of Brent crude rose from $80 to more than $120 it is back below $100 today The imf estimates that energy exporters in the Middle East and Central Asia will this year net $320bn more in oil revenues than it had previously expected a figure equivalent to about 7% of their combined gdp Over the next five years the cumulative surplus could reach $14trn Gulf leaders must now work out how to spend the proceeds of what could be the last big gush of oil wealth Some promise to pay down debts and save for a post-petroleum future Yet there will be pressure to share the bounty with the publicand few checks on those who wish to splash out on mega-projects or global influence The impact in diplomatic circles is already visible On a visit to Jeddah in July America President Joe Biden bumped fists with Muhammad bin Salman the Saudi crown prince Mr Biden had until recently kept the prince at arm length; the current political imperative to bring down petrol prices leaves little room for moral stancesExpensive oil augments the financial power of the Gulf states at home and abroad opening a gusher of public spending and steering flows of money around the world The long rise in oil prices in the 2000s helped fuel huge global imbalances depressed interest rates and attracted a stream of supplicants looking to curry favour Cheap oil brings shrinking ambitions When the last sustained period of high prices ended in 2014 it seemed as if the old social contract which promised hefty subsidies and cushy lifetime gigs in the public sector would have to change There was talk of diversification higher domestic fuel and food priceseven taxes A period of rock-bottom oil prices and the hit from covid saw fiscal positions deteriorate This year windfall offers an opportunity to strengthen them see chart 1 Bahrain public debt rose to 130% of gdp in 2020 but the country budget is based on the assumption that oil will fetch a mere $60 a barrel High prices may allow it to reduce its debt ratio by about 12 percentage points this year even though it is the smallest producer in the Gulf Co-operation Council or gcc a group that also comprises Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates Oman debt burden is projected to fall by more than 20 percentage points of gdp Other leaders aim to save much of their earnings Mohammed al-Jadaan the Saudi finance minister says his government will not touch its oil bonanza at least this year It will put away the money at the central bank then use it in 2023 to replenish foreign reserves or top up the Public Investment Fund pif the sovereign-wealth fund that has become the kingdom main driver of investment Bahrain will use some of its surplus to refill a fund meant to provide for future generations which it drained during the pandemicYet the pressure to spend will be intense Gulf economies have not been as squeezed by soaring prices as the rest of the world The imf expects inflation in the gcc to peak at 31% this year well below levels in America and Europe Abundant cheap foreign labour keeps wage costs low Most countries rely on fuel subsidies to limit inflation A strong dollar meanwhile holds down the cost of imports five of the six gcc members peg their currencies to the greenback Under the pumpResidents in the Gulf are nonetheless feeling the pinch The uae phased out its fuel subsidies in 2015 and petrol prices climbed by 79% from January to July when the government raised them once again to 452 dirhams $123 a litre That is not bad by global standards but shockingly expensive for a rich petrostatedrivers in Saudi Arabia pay half as much In July the uae announced that it would almost double the welfare budget for poor citizens from 27bn dirhams to 5bn Eligible families will receive stipends for housing and education plus an allowance to offset higher food and energy costs With just 1m citizens representing 10% of the total population the uae can afford to splurge a bit Satisfying the citizenry will be a bigger challenge in Saudi Arabia where two-thirds of the population of 35m are nationals The Saudi government used past oil booms to offer more jobs and higher wages in the public sector Doing so now would run counter to Vision 2030 an economic-diversification plan meant to shift the kingdom away from oil Firms already grumble about how hard it is to retain talent Many young Saudis see private-sector work as a fun distraction until a government job comes alongOil wealth offers other ways to shield citizens from cost pressures In 2016 the Gulf states agreed to introduce a value-added-tax of 5% and four have done so since the laggards are Kuwait and Qatar Saudi Arabia has gone much further In 2020 it tripled vat to 15% hoping to offset the fiscal effects of the pandemic and low oil prices “You have a policy tool you didn’t have before” says Nasser Saidi a Lebanese economist who runs an advisory firm in Dubai “Rather than increase spending or hiring you could lower vat” Competing with such concerns is the need to think long-term: beyond the boom and ultimately beyond oil At the modernist offices of Bahrain sovereign-wealth fund such thoughts are sobering “Of course we’re all happy the oil price is high but the focus needs to stay on the non-oil economy” says an executive Working out what that means in practice is no easy task Some sovereign-wealth managers in the Gulf say their mandates have become almost contradictory They are meant to husband oil wealth for future generations but are increasingly asked to deploy capital to fuel non-oil growth a job that entails plenty of riskGulf countries have not always done a good job of judging which risks to take The region is littered with failed mega-projects from earlier booms Saudi Arabia gleaming financial district meant to compete with Dubai was plagued by delays and cost overruns When it was eventually finished it sat empty: banks saw no reason to move The uae spent billions to create artificial islands shaped like a map of the world More than a decade later the archipelago is derelict The uae ambitious plans to become a semiconductor-manufacturing hub and a centre for health tourism have similarly fizzled out Wild flights of fancy like Neom stand ready to absorb a hefty chunk of the oil money this time round Saudi Arabia also wants to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029 spraying desert mountains with snow; Dubai has a zany plan to create 40000 jobs in the metaverse in five years Even less ostentatious projects may prove wasteful Saudi Arabia sees tourism as the centre of its post-oil economy providing at least 10% of jobs and gdp The oil boom will give the pif billions to throw at resorts amusement parks and other diversions Yet Saudi officials cannot point to a proper assessment showing that its hoped-for 100m tourists will in fact choose to visit the kingdom each year As Ali al-Salim a Kuwaiti investor notes: “It a pretty fickle business to be the linchpin of your economic plan”The Gulf states would be wise to focus on areas where they have clearer competitive advantages Developing expertise in desalination techniques and technologies much as Israel has done could make a virtue of the region aridity Investments in green-energy technologies like hydrogen could offer a source of revenues after the energy transition Mr Saidi proposes investing in renewables projects and climate-mitigation strategies in Asia and Africa as a green version of China Belt and Road Initiative “This is a moment when you want to look again at how you provide foreign aid” he argues Tee offCertainly the boom stands to reshape the Gulf relations with the rest of the worldas demonstrated by Mr Biden trip to Jeddah Enormous quantities of Saudi money are being spent to burnish the kingdom reputation in other contexts as well The world of golf for example is being transformed as liv Golf a Saudi-backed rival to the pga tour lures stars with fantastical payouts The country started hosting a Formula 1 race in 2021 Pop stars including Justin Bieber Mariah Carey and David Guetta have recently performed in the kingdomThe boom will also have less tangible international consequences The gcc combined current-account surplus this year may run to more than $400bn or 04% of global gdp see chart 2a slightly higher share of world output than the biggest surpluses achieved before the global financial crisis of 2007-09 In past booms oil profits have been recycled into investment flows back to America through purchases of Treasuries for instance funding America current-account deficits Yet America has become the world largest producer of oil and big emerging economies have grown richer and developed a thirst for the stuff Thus the Gulf surplus today is matched in part by weaker balance-of-payments positions in big emerging economies That includes China and India but also scores of smaller countries including a few like Sri Lanka for which the surge in the cost of imported oil has been crippling High oil prices have hit the world as a whole harder than they did in the 2000s This is because they are largely the result of interruptions to supply especially from Russia rather than robust growth in global demand More than a few governments have already approached Gulf leaders for moneyalbeit to meet urgent obligations rather than to greenify their economies Like China and India Saudi Arabia and the uae have played a growing role lending to poorer countries over the past two decades taking over a position once reserved for advanced economies and multilateral institutions like the World Bank The developing crisis across low- and middle-income economies could give Gulf states significant leverage over less fortunate places should they choose to wield itIt may well be the last such opportunity In poor countries and rich ones the pain of soaring energy costs adds a new urgency to efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels At the heart of the boom the feeling is palpable “There a ‘days-are-numbered’ kind of sentiment” says Mr al-Salim the Kuwaiti investor “You look at the state Europe is in I don’t think they’re going to allow themselves to be this vulnerable years from now” Which raises a question Will the Gulf?

 Aug 5th 2022,For a change American inflation is lower than expected,Editor note August 10th 2022: This article originally published on August 5th has been updated after the release of the latest consumer-price inflation figuresWhat a difference a couple of data points make Much of the recent talk about America economy had focused on the possibility of stagflation as gdp shrank and prices soared Suddenly though things look rosier First on August 5th statisticians reported that 530000 jobs were created in the previous monthmore than twice as many as expected Then on August 10th they reported that consumer prices in July were the same as in Junethe first absence of month-on-month inflation since early 2020 Could the doomsayers be wrong and America really be about to enjoy both an economic boom and price stability?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNot so fast It is foolish to rush to any conclusion based on a week worth of data especially amid the lingering covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine Previous bursts of optimism have proved unlike inflation to be transitory Moreover a closer look at both reports gives as much reason for consternation as for celebrationStart with the jobs figures America unemployment rate in July fell to 35% matching a half-century low hit just before the pandemic Normally that would have been greeted with unalloyed joy But the ultra-strong labour market is a challenge for companies struggling to hire staff Wages rose at an annual pace of 52% over the past three months up from 47% in June Meanwhile the dominant factor in the drop in inflation was the recent fall in oil prices Once volatile food and energy costs are stripped out core inflation is still up by 59% compared with a year earlier Taken together the data cast a fresh light on a debate that has raged among economists this year: just how big a trade-off the Federal Reserve faces between inflation and jobs as it tightens monetary policy Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has long insisted that present labour-market tightness may mean there is a path whereby companies can reduce their demand for new workers without large numbers ending up on the dole In other words the trade-off could be less severe than in previous periods of monetary tightening One way of understanding the debate is to consider the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu also known as the natural rate of unemployment It refers to the lowest level of unemployment that an economy can sustain before wage inflation starts to accelerate Not directly observable it is based on estimates The concept of the nairu was once central to economic analysis and to the Fed thinking about rates But it fell out of favour before the pandemic when unemployment dipped below the assumed nairu range of 4-55% without any discernible pickup in inflation In a strategic review published in 2020 the Fed indicated that the concept would no longer figure prominently in its policy decisionsHowever the surge in inflation over the past year alongside the sharp drop in joblessness has put the nairu back in the spotlight There is a good case that it shifted markedly higher early in the pandemic In mid-2020 unemployment soared to almost 15% As Brandyn Bok and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau of the San Francisco Fed have noted such a jump would normally have warranted a bigger slowdown in inflation than actually occurred The fact that there was no deflation implies that the natural rate of unemployment probably shifted higher The researchers estimated that the nairu may have reached 8% in 2020 before edging down to 6% at the end of 2021 Now the economy may be experiencing the flipside of an elevated nairu: higher-than-expected inflation as unemployment fallsStructural changes in the economy during covid help explain why the natural rate of unemployment may have increased From the boom in delivery and warehouse work to the subsequent recovery in restaurant and travel work employers’ staffing needs have evolved fast Compounding that has been a change in what people expect from their jobs epitomised by the shift to more remote working One normal response from companies has been to offer higher wagesA gap between the measured unemployment rate of 35% and the estimated natural rate of 6% implies that wage growth is likely to remain strong in the coming months That will feed through into core inflation even if oil prices continue to fall A pessimistic interpretation is that the Fed may have to keep raising rates until measured unemployment approaches the nairu If so millions of people would lose their jobsA more hopeful interpretation is that the gap may ultimately be closed more by the nairu itself falling rather than by unemployment rising After the Fed most recent rate rise in July Mr Powell laid out this perspective: “Logically if the pandemic and the disorder in the labour market caused the natural rate to move up then as the labour market settles down in principle you should see it move back down”It is easy to see why the Fed no longer places the nairu on the pedestal that it once did Not only is it invisible it is also unstable especially when the economy itself is in flux Yet slippery as it is it gets to the crux of today concerns Workers may rejoice at evidence of rapid job growth and wage increases Only when these occur alongside a continued deceleration of inflation will economists’ consternation give way to true celebration For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 3rd 2022,An anatomy of this year market mayhem,AFTER A FRANTIC sell-off in the first half of the year investors are taking a breather The S&P 500 index of American stocks for instance is back around the level it was at the start of June Yet with a little less than five months of 2022 remaining it would take a turnaround of astonishing proportions to avoid a torrid year in financial markets The period distinguishing characteristics are already clear: the slump has been unusually deep and unusually broad If the year ended now an investor in the MSCI All Country World Index of global stocks would have lost 15% the lowest return since 2008 The broad-based decline across asset classes has added another element of pain too Most obviously both stocks and bonds have been hammered The good news is that distress has been concentrated among a few types of assets and firms Whether that silver lining remains come the end of the year is uncertain Such a coincident fall in stocks and bonds is rare When stock prices fall because of a weakening economy bond prices usually rise owing to expectations of interest-rate cuts bolstering a mixed portfolio Conversely stocks often benefit from a stronger economy while bonds sell off The double dip this time is driven by surging inflation expected interest-rate rises and a belief that the economic situation will deteriorate An investment in the FTSE Global World Government Bond Index would have lost 13% so far in 2022 making this the first year since 1986 when the index was established in which there have been double-digit falls in both stocks and bonds globallyMoreover equity markets have been battered almost everywhere Stocks in Europe Japan and emerging markets are all down As a result there are precious few winners The Bloomberg Commodity Index comprising energy agricultural and industrial commodities is up by 18% since January Oil and gas companies have been bolstered by Russia invasion of Ukraine and the massive disruption to oil and gas supplies that followed MSCI stock indexes for oil exporters like the United Arab Emirates Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are up as are those for Brazil and Indonesia which produce other commodities The MSCI Chile index is up by more than 20% but with a market capitalisation of less than $40bn that is not much consolation to investors If you were presented with this degree of misery 20 years ago you might have expected the odd mainstream financial firm to start looking wobbly Perhaps the most unusual thing of all is how serious distress so far has been largely confined to two groupsboth outside mainstream Western finance The first is Chinese property developers; sales of which have cratered this year driven by concerns about the financial health of the companies and the economic impact of protracted covid-19 lockdowns A bond maturing in January 2024 issued by Country Garden a developer which until recently held an investment-grade credit rating now offers a yield of more than 100% up from 5% this time last year But China strict capital controls mean that the turmoil has produced few reverberations outside the country so far The second place where distress has emerged is the world of cryptocurrency and decentralised finance Celsius Terra and Three Arrows Capital respectively a crypto-oriented lender a stablecoin and a crypto-oriented hedge fund have all gone to the wall The big question for the rest of the year is whether the pockets of distress will continue to be isolated Already the strain in emerging markets which are confronted with rising global interest rates as well as elevated food and energy prices is becoming clear As of late July around 36% of issuers on the JPMorgan Chase Emerging Market Bond Index had yields above 10% a figure which peaked at only 29% during the market panic in March 2020 Fortunately for the West its mainstream financial institutions have become less exposed to emerging markets over time Another source of angst could be the euro zone if the energy crisis intensifies over the winter: something the European Central Bank tried to guard against in July by creating a new mechanism to curb bond-market jitters And as it has grown harder and more expensive to issue corporate bonds indebted firms everywhere could face a building funding crunch One of the more unusual years in finance over the past few decades is not over yet 
 Aug 3rd 2022,Does high inflation matter?,Editor note: This is an updated version of a column first published in April It started in America but the surge in inflation has spread to the rest of the rich world Consumer prices across the oecd club of mostly rich countries are rising by 103% year on year the fastest pace of increase in at least three decades In the Netherlands inflation is nearing 12% even higher than in America while in Estonia it is over 22% How forcefully should central banks respond to the inflationary surge? The answer depends on how much damage inflation is causing And that depends on whom you askInflation is regarded as costly because it erodes people savings and distorts price signals And there are unquestionably instances when it has brought an economy to its knees During Weimar Germany period of hyperinflation in the 1920s people savings evaporated eliminating the middle class and paving the way for the rise of fascism Inflation also spiralled out of control in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe As price signals broke down millions went without foodBut in more moderate inflationary episodes such as the current one the evidence for economic carnage is weaker One common worry is that increases in prices outpace rises in wages causing people real incomes to decline This has almost certainly been happening across rich countries in recent months American real hourly earnings fell by 36% in the year to JuneOn the whole though economists see a tenuous connection between inflation and workers’ real living standards Sometimes prices rise faster than wages; sometimes they do not British real wages grew strongly during the inflationary era of the 1970s According to a study published in 1975 American workers whether unionised or not had seen inflation-busting pay rises in the preceding decade The Economist has looked at data for 35 oecd countries going as far back as 1990 In years when inflation exceeded 5% we find real wages rose on average Inflation can also help the unemployed find jobs even as it hurts people already in work After the global financial crisis of 2007-09 sterling depreciated lifting inflation in Britain and reducing real wages Companies could then afford to hire more workersThe notion that inflation messes with price signals another putative economic cost is also exaggerated at moderate levels Capitalism allocates resources via movements in relative prices: if the price of cars rises compared with that for bicycles more cars should eventually be produced The worry is that inflation disrupts this process making it harder to discern the “true” relative prices of cars and bicyclesIn a paper published in 2018 however Emi Nakamura of the University of California Berkeley and colleagues examine price dispersion for the same sorts of products over time Looking at the period of high inflation in the 1970s they find “no evidence that prices deviated more from their optimal level” than just before the pandemic when inflation was far lower The “strong conclusions about [the] optimality of low inflation rates [in this regard] need to be reassessed” they concludeSophisticated papers such as these back up a broader body of work going back decades that questions the link between inflation and growth A paper published by the imf in 2014 noted that “few empirical studies have even tried to find costs of single-digit inflation” In 1996 Michael Bruno and William Easterly then both of the World Bank found “no evidence of any relationship between inflation and growth at annual inflation rates less than 40%” The next year Paul Krugman wrote that “even though inflation is universally regarded as a terrible scourge efforts to measure its costs come up with embarrassingly small numbers”So does the rich world current bout of inflation have minimal costs or even none at all? The trouble for economists is that there is a world outside their research Few people know or care about their results But they know what they think about inflation: they utterly implacably loathe itInflation seems to hold a special place in the public consciousness Our analysis of English-language newspapers and blog posts suggests that during the 2010s media organisations mentioned inflation 50% more frequently than they mentioned unemployment even though joblessness during that decade was a far bigger economic problem In the 1990s Robert Shiller of Yale University asked people in a number of countries about their opinions on inflation and compared them with the views of economists He found that ordinary people held much more extreme views on the subject than the academics who study it for a livingPeople believe that inflation makes them poorer They worry it makes it harder to plan And they believe that inflation is a sign that unscrupulous companies are taking advantage of them two-thirds of Americans ascribe the recent rise in inflation to corporate greed Economists by contrast are more equivocal in their answers More than half of Americans “fully agreed” that preventing high inflation was as important as stopping drug abuse or maintaining educational standards compared with just 18% of economists In the same survey Mr Shiller found that 46% of people wanted the government to lower the price level after an inflation spike ie to engineer deflation something few economists would recommendGet realPerhaps policymakers should just ignore the views of ordinary people If experts find that inflation has surprisingly low costs then what more information is needed to guide policy? Another way of looking at it however is that the psychological costs of high inflation are real and that central bankers and governments should take them into account Fighting inflation by forcefully tightening fiscal or monetary policy is often seen as a hard-nosed choice because it cools the economy and risks provoking a recession In fact it is one of the most populist policies out there Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 28thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 2nd 2022,Global inequality is rising again,COVID-19 WAS never going to be good for the poor At first however the disease was not associated with rising inequality Richer economies tended to suffer larger declines in GDP per person than many poor ones in 2020and within those countries hefty stimulus packages protected the poorest from penury As the pandemic wore on though its effects on global inequality shifted Richer countries enjoyed better access to vaccines than poorer ones and were more able to sustain spending on programmes to support incomes and bolster recoveries The net effect of the pandemic has been to raise inequality between countries back to the levels of the early 2010s on some measures Thus the long decline in global inequality that began around 1990 has come to an endand gaps between rich and poor now look likely to widen as poor countries take longer to recover from covid Yet the causes of inequality resurgence are not universally bleak Paradoxically part of the explanation lies in increasing incomes among the formerly impoverishedTo understand why consider the two different forms of inequality researchers look at: gaps that occur within a country and those between countries From the 1980s through the 2000s inequality rose within most countries including many in the emerging world as rich Americans Britons Chinese and so on did better than their poorer compatriots The contribution of this within-country dynamic was swamped however by the diverging fortunes of rich and poor countries as a whole Because poorer countries were growing faster than richer onesand massive ones like China and India were doing especially wellthe net effect of changes across the world economy was a sharp decline in global inequalityProgress then ground to a halt in the decade before the pandemic Shifts to the distribution of income within countries ceased to push inequality higher indeed in some recent years within-country shifts served to reduce global inequality on net But this generally welcome trend occurred alongside much more halting progress in the closing of income gaps between countries In the 2000s for example an economy at the 30th percentile of the global income distribution grew two percentage points faster on an average annual basis than did America in terms of GDP per person In the 2010s by contrast GDP per person at the 30th percentile grew slightly slower than in America As a consequence measures of global inequality showed very little improvement if any from about 2014 until the eve of the pandemicDuring the pandemic vaccines and more generous rich-world stimulus widened the gap between countries Worse still reckons the World Bank the burden of income losses in poorer countries fell disproportionately on those at the bottom of the income spectrum As a result the increase in global inequality reflected both the widening gap between rich and poor countries as well as increased inequality within poor economies Developing countries now face gloomier economic prospects Scarring effects of the pandemic including forgone schooling and investment stand to constrain growth as do heavy debt burdens and the challenges posed by Russia war in Ukraine The IMF reckons that by 2024 output across the emerging world will probably remain more than 5% below the pre-pandemic trend while that in rich economies will be less than 1% below trend and output in America will be above itYet higher global inequality is also the outcome of a happier development Recent work by Ravi Kanbur of Cornell University and Eduardo Ortiz-Juarez and Andy Sumner of King College London suggests that measured global inequality may rise in steady fashion in the years ahead for much the same reason it fell in recent decades While the emerging world as a whole has gained ground on rich countries since the 1980s the lion share of the reduction in global inequality over that time was attributable to the rapid economic growth of China and India GDP per person in China now stands at roughly the global averagea milestone India may reach in the 2030s As incomes in those countries cross that threshold their continued growth will become a source of increasing rather than decreasing inequality The enrichment of two countries that are home to more than a third of the world population is undoubtedly one of the big economic success stories of the past four decades It has the unfortunate effect however of making the disappointing progress of those at the lower end of the income distribution more apparentRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How high property prices can damage the economy Jul 28thShould central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Aug 1st 2022,The global housing boom is running out of steam,Diana Mousaly spent months searching for a home in Windsor Canada southernmost city It was the height of covid-19 and prices were rising across the country Ms Mousaly a 27-year-old clerk at the local police service viewed nearly 100 homes and made 60 or so offersoften at hundreds of thousands of Canadian dollars above the asking pricebefore finally closing on a property last September A decade ago her parents purchased a home for half the amount “It four times bigger than mine” she sighsMs Mousaly may have bought at the wrong time For the past two decades Canada white-hot property market has burned ever brighter Now things are cooling down: prices have fallen for three consecutive months The same is true in other frothy markets In New Zealand where valuations at the end of 2021 were up by 45% since the start of the pandemic the price of a home has also fallen for three straight months In Sweden prices fell by nearly 4% in June the steepest monthly decline since the global financial crisis in 2007-09 Two in five homes in Australia are worth less than they were three months agoEven where prices are still rising higher borrowing costs are dampening buyer enthusiasm With monthly payments on a typical new mortgage in America now three-quarters higher than three years ago loan applications are down by more than a quarter from their peak in January The share of first-time buyers has hit a 13-year low Some of the froth is also being blown away in Britain Mortgage approvals in April fell back to pre-pandemic levels In May home sales fell by a tenth compared with the previous year If the global housing boom is finally running out of steam how far will prices fall? Analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy forecast modest drops of 5-10% in America and Britain In these countries homeowners are less likely to be forced to sell by rising mortgage costs since fixed-rate loans are common In Australia and Sweden the analysts reckon prices could slip by 15% With higher levels of household debt and thus more exposure to rate rises Canada and New Zealand are most vulnerableprices in these countries could fall by 20%Two factors should prevent house prices from entering a death spiral One is the shortage of homes in most rich countries Depending on the estimate America is short of either 38m or 58m homes; England needs an estimated 345000 new homes a year and is building half that number; and Canada requires an additional 35m by 2030 at the current pace of construction The other factor is tight labour markets Low unemployment in many rich countries means people are less likely to fall behind on their debts Combined with stronger household finances this should prevent a slump on the scale of the financial crisis in all but the wobbliest markets But the pain will be unevenly spread Pandemic hotspots are particularly vulnerable During lockdowns the search for large gardens or green space sent housing markets into a frenzy Parisians fled to the French countryside Turkish residents left Istanbul for resort towns Londoners wanting to take advantage of remote work flocked to leafy neighbourhoods like Richmond and Dulwich or escaped the city altogether for cheaper homes Cracks have started to appear in these markets Fewer bidding wars are taking place in the American mountain towns and sunbelt states that attract well-paid Californians and New Yorkers More than half of homes for sale in Salt Lake City Utah had their price cut in June; in Boise Idaho three-fifths did The question now is how low prices will go The Royal Bank of Canada thinks sales in its home country will plummet from their peak in 2021 by more than 40% worse even than in the financial crisis when they fell by 38% Things may not be quite as dramatic elsewhere But for owners used to prices heading in only one direction any drop will come as a shock 
 Jul 28th 2022,How high property prices can damage the economy,Economists’ interest in land has waxed and waned over time For the political economists of the 18th and 19th centuries it was central to understanding the world They believed that the distribution of rents from land ownership could explain the yawning gaps between the rich and poor and all sorts of other economic ills Economists cared less about land in the 20th century Since the turn of the millennium however they have increasingly debated the impact that restrictive zoning laws have on the economic output of cities The global financial crisis sparked an increase in research on the consequences of property slumps Banks’ balance-sheets tend to weaken and worried homeowners spend less potentially triggering a recession America housing crash during 2007-09 in particular was much studied Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn recent years another strand of research has emerged which rather like the political economists of yore attributes many long-standing economic ills to land It explores how high and rising land prices affect lending investment and ultimately productivity and much of it looks closely at China long property boom The worrying conclusion is that high and rising property prices can also have damaging economic effects by crowding out productive investment and leading to a misallocation of capital In the most extreme cases inflated land prices may already be the cause of a protracted slowdown in productivity growth Real estate is the largest asset class in the world In 2020 it made up around 68% of the world non-financial assets which includes plant and machinery as well as intangibles such as intellectual property Land rather than the structures built on top of it accounts for slightly over half of that 68% As values have ballooned the share of land in non-financial assets has increased sharply in some countries though few report the data In Britain for instance it went from 39% in 1995 to 56% in 2020 Because land can easily be valued and cannot be hidden or broken it is good collateral to borrow against So when prices are rising as they have in most places for much of the past few decades the initial effect is to boost lending and economic activity Households can use their increasingly valuable property to borrow at lower interest rates than they otherwise would Land-owning firms too can access finance more easily Fatter asset holdings also make people feel more comfortable spending money But the use of land as collateral has harmful effects too especially in places where banks play a big role in financing companies Firms’ ability to borrow tends to be determined by their existing assets rather than their productive potential And those that own land find it much easier to borrow from banks than those say with lots of intangible assets A paper published in 2018 by Sebastian Doerr of the Bank for International Settlements found that listed American firms with more property collateral were able to borrow and invest more than their competitors even though they were less productive These effects were also evident in Spain just before the global financial crisis In research published last year Sergi Basco of Universitat Barcelona and David Lopez-Rodriguez and Enrique Moral-Benito of the Bank of Spain noted that property-owning manufacturers in the country tended to receive more bank credit than other firms Rising property prices can also discourage productive lending and lead to capital being misallocated When housing markets boom banks tend to engage in more mortgage lending But because lenders face capital constraints this is often accompanied by reduced lending to businesses The effect is illustrated by research published in 2018 by Indraneel Chakraborty of the University of Miami Itay Goldstein of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and Andrew MacKinlay of Virginia Tech The paper which looks at data from America between 1988 and 2006 found that a one-standard-deviation increase in house prices in areas where a bank has branches reduced lending growth to firms that borrow from the same bank by 42% The total investment undertaken by the affected firms fell by 21% Such crowding-out effects may have been sizeable in other places too considering that banks around the rich world have sharply increased their mortgage lending Across 17 advanced economies mortgages’ share of total bank loans climbed from 32% in 1952 to 58% in 2016 the latest year for which data are availableWhatever the effects of high land prices in the West the scale of the problem in China appears even bigger given that the country investors have a huge appetite for real estate A range of recent research suggests that China high land prices shift bank lending away from land-light manufacturers and reduce spending on research and development by listed firms; they also appear to lead to a reallocation of managerial talent towards the property sector One especially striking result comes from a paper published in 2019 by Harald Hau of the University of Geneva and Difei Ouyang of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing based on data from manufacturers in 172 Chinese cities It concludes that a 50% increase in property prices would raise borrowing costs reduce investment and productivity and result in a 355% decline in the firms’ value-added output Hitting home The conclusion that high and rising property prices can throttle economic activity carries important implications for how policymakers should treat investment in land and housing Encouraging much more housebuilding for instance would help deflate collateral values Restricting the ownership of multiple properties would alter the distribution of that collateral And limiting the amount of mortgage lending banks can do might lead more credit to flow to productive purposes A more ambitious idea would be to tax land values which by lowering the market value of land might reduce its attractiveness as collateral Such a tax was funnily enough the goal of many 18th- and 19th-century reformers as they sought a more equal society A new obsession with land could well revive an old idea Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Should central banks’ inflation targets be raised?

 Jul 28th 2022,China official growth figures are bad enough to be believed,When china Politburo the 25-member committee that oversees the Communist Party met this time last year to ponder the economy China rulers seemed quite confident Their annual growth target was in easy reach and they were keen to crack down further on the country overstretched property developers As The Economist went to press the Politburo was preparing to meet again But the economy looks quite different China attempts to stamp out any outbreak of covid-19 have crippled manufacturing intermittently and consumption more persistently Distressed developers have stopped working on pre-sold flatsand aggrieved homebuyers have refused to pay their mortgages until construction resumesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis has put China rulers in a pickle They seem determined to stick to their zero-covid policy And they would no doubt love to cling to their official gdp growth target of “around 55%” But it has become clear they cannot do both Unless of course they fiddle the growth figuresThat is not beyond them But there is so far little sign of it The most recent data showed that the economy grew by only 04% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier This was not only bad but worse than expected by private forecasters In a large teleconference in May Li Keqiang China prime minister urged local officials to do more for the economy But he also cautioned them to seek truth from facts abiding by statistical regulationsWhen he was himself a local official in the north-eastern province of Liaoning Mr Li sought the truth about the provincial economy from three facts in particular: the electricity it consumed the cargo travelling on its railways and the amount of loans disbursed by its banks These indicators he felt were more reliable than the official gdp figures In a similar spirit John Fernald Eric Hsu and Mark Spiegel of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco have shown that a judicious combination of eight alternative indicators including electricity consumption rail cargo retail sales and consumer expectations does a reasonably good job of tracking China economic ups and downs Seven of these indicators all except consumer confidence have already been updated for the three months from April to June They can therefore be used to cross-check the latest official growth figureThe chart shows our attempt to do that using much the same method as Mr Fernald and his co-authors Our calculation is not designed to show if China has systematically overstated gdp growth over the past two decades But it can detect if reported growth is nearer its underlying trend than it should be given how far the other seven indicators have strayed from their own usual trajectories The awful data on retail sales and construction in the second quarter were for example far outside the norm But these shocking figures were partly offset by respectable numbers for rail freight and exportsIn all these indicators suggest the official growth measure was honest They would be consistent with gdp growth that is if anything a little higher than the 04% reported Our approach cannot reveal every kind of statistical skulduggery but it does suggest China made no extra effort to fudge the figures in the second quarter despite the unusual ugliness of the time China rulers want to fight the downturn the virus and doubts about their country data They are doing a better job on the last two counts than on the first For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 28th 2022,Reminiscences of a financial columnist,It is telling that one of the best books about financial markets was published almost a century ago “Reminiscences of a Stock Operator” by Edwin Lefevre is a fictionalised account of the exploits of Jesse Livermore a speculator Livermore made a fortune selling the market short during the financial panic of 1907 He would repeat the trick in 1929 The book captures a particular timeof bucket shops insider pools and dandy tips on Western Union or American Steel But it is also timelessListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs this writer finishes a four-year stint as Buttonwood the one tentative conclusion he draws from the experience is something that Livermore realised a century ago: there is nothing new on Wall Street What happens today in the markets has happened before and will happen again Every extreme of greed or fear has a precedent Technology changes but people do notThe beginning for this Buttonwood was May 2018 At the time there was a good deal of optimism among American and European asset managers about business prospects in China There was much talk about its “Wild West” stockmarketwith lots of retail trading on tips and a rapid turnover of shares Rich-world entrants fancied they would add a dash of professionalism But instead of China market becoming more American the reverse happened In 2020 there was a surge in new accounts at no-fee brokers notably Robinhood catering to small investors in America A gaggle of social-media pundits emerged to mobilise this new army of speculators They piled into tech darlings such as Tesla but also bombed-out stocks such as GameStop a video-games retailer This “meme-stock” craze seemed new but it wasn’t What it most resembled was the bucket shops of early-20th-century America where Livermore first learned to read the markets Here ordinary punters exchanged tips and could bet on the direction of favoured stocks for a tiny initial outlay The Robinhood crowd though they had better technology had similar preferences They were keen on call options on stocks that had the characteristics of long-odds bets As with bucket-shop punts these options mostly expire worthless but can reap a spectacular profit if the share price surgesManias scams and iffy schemes are recurring evils “I used to think that people were more gullible in the 1860s and 1870s than the 1900s” says the narrator of “Reminiscences” But Livermore only had to pick up his newspaper to read about the latest Ponzi scheme or crooked broker More recently there has been the Wirecard fraud the Archegos blow-up the shell-company boom and any number of dodgy digital currencies This year has so far been a rejoinder to such excesses As Livermore knew well tighter money and a giddy stockmarket are a dangerous mix His big short in 1907 was in response to signals from the money markets which were “megaphoning warnings to the entire world” But they were not the only warnings he ever heard In the world of “Reminiscences” bull markets are marked by the “calamity howling” of “old-stagers [who] said everybodyexcept themselveshad gone crazy” Doom-mongers are forever with us Indeed there is a kind of punditry that echoes the millenarian sects of medieval Europe the adherents of which believed they were living in the “last days” It anticipates an endgame in which all excesses will be washed from the markets Perhaps such a reckoning is already in train But it cannot be the endgame because the game never ends If history is anything to go by a big bust would merely set the stage for another phase of play Injuries heal with time Memories of the last brutal bear market eventually fade The unceasing contest between fear and greed resumes The thoughtful investor has a lot to reckon with and that won’t change either There are constant judgments to be made about company managers business strategy economic policy politics and geopoliticsas well as the opinions and likely reactions of other investors who may or may not be as thoughtfulAnd as Livermore knew well any investor has also to fight the “expensive enemies within himself” This endless wrestling with powerful emotions such as hope doubt and fear is a big part of what makes Wall Street so fascinating It has been a great privilege to watch the unfolding drama from this perch and to try to make sense of it all The honour now passes to others Thank you so much for reading Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The Fed put morphs into a Fed call Jul 23rdWhy markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thCrypto last man standing Jul 9thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 26th 2022,Recession fears weigh on commercial property,Property is usually regarded as a good hedge against inflation Landlords’ ability to increase rents can cushion the blow from rising costs If inflation is driven by strong economic growth rents go up buildings stay full and landlords are assured of rising income Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWorries about the economy however have turned this strategy on its head Strained household budgets and stretched corporate balance-sheets could limit tenants’ ability to pay more rent jeopardising investors’ returns Moreover with the cost of debt rising owners of office towers hotels shopping malls and other types of property risk being stuck with lower returns on assets that may now be overpriced Many fear a correction is coming The darkening mood is in contrast to the optimism of 2021 when returns soared rents rocketed and fundraising fuelled by low interest rates raced to record highs Even as offices remained eerily empty fund managers rushed to park their capital in new blocks of flats labs and warehouses pushing up the global value of professionally managed property by nearly $1trn That stellar performance has since fizzled out The share prices of listed real-estate investment trusts are tanking and expectations for rental growth and returns are being scaled back In America delinquency rates crept up in June for the first time since late 2021 The strain comes on top of other challenges ubs a bank expects the shift to remote work to hit leasing demand for offices by as much as 20% Decarbonisation will require hefty investment in older buildings Meanwhile the decline in bricks-and-mortar stores is bad news for shopping-mall owners and rising air fares threaten the demand for hotelsNo wonder investors are tightening their belts After a record start to 2022 deal activity in America is cooling says Kevin Fagan of Moody Analytics a research firm Transactions that are already under way are taking longer to negotiate; some are being put on hold In America and Britain commercial-property investment between April and June plunged to its lowest level since the pandemic began to $86bn and £10bn $12bn respectively Dealmaking also fell in Germany Not all properties will struggle The highest-quality most energy-efficient buildings with modern amenities and on prime sites typically owned by big institutional investors are expected to fare relatively well By contrast lower-quality assets across Europe lost around a tenth of their value in the second quarter of this year compared with the previous three months reckons Green Street a research firm That decline follows a poor 2021 for many such buildings: rents for lower-quality offices in London fell by 9% last year compared with 2020 even as those for prime office space rose by 8% Some cities will do better than others In America sunbelt markets such as Atlanta Dallas and San Diego are expected to be among the top performers this year providing better returns than places like New York and San Francisco where workers have been slower to return to the office Landlords who can guarantee future rent growth or those in markets with constrained supply are also relatively well-positioned This includes owners of labs warehouses and other logistics property The upshot is that although commercial-property prices might fall the decline is not forecast to be precipitous Analysts at Capital Economics a consultancy reckon that values in America could face a peak-to-trough fall of 6-8% That is a bigger decline than the one at the start of the pandemic but is far from the plunge of 34% during the global financial crisis Another comfort is that banks have become less exposed to commercial property In Britain for instance it makes up almost 7% of lenders’ loan books compared with 12% before the financial crisis Offices malls and warehouses may not provide as much shelter from inflation as investors might like but they have at least become less likely to amplify financial trouble For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 24th 2022,Why it is too early to say the world economy is in recession,Everyone is a pessimist these days On July 14th Steven Blitz of ts Lombard an investment-research firm said that he was now expecting a recession this year in the world largest economy a day after Bank of America made the same call Goldman Sachs another bank expects gdp in the euro zone to fall in both the third and fourth quarters of the year Americans’ Google searches for “recession” have never been so high Traders are selling copper a proxy for industrial health buying the dollar a sign that they are nervous and pricing in interest-rate cuts in 2023Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA number of factors have combined to create a toxic mixture In response to the covid-19 pandemic America overstimulated its economy provoking inflation not just within its borders but beyond them as consumers’ voracious demand for goods bunged up the world supply chains China attempts to stamp out covid compounded these problems Then Russia invasion of Ukraine caused commodity prices to soar In response to the ensuing inflation roughly four-fifths of central banks worldwide have raised interest rates by an average of 15 percentage points After a meeting that ended on July 27th the Federal Reserve raised rates for the fourth time this cycle by three-quarters of a point At the root of recession worries is a fear of the consequences of monetary tightening It is clear that central banks have to take the proverbial punchbowl away from the party Wage growth in the rich world is far too strong given weak productivity growth Inflation is too high But the risk is that higher rates will end the party altogether rather than making it less raucous History is not encouraging in this regard Since 1955 there have been three periods when rates in America rose as much as they are expected to this year: in 1973 1979 and 1981 In each case a recession followed within six months Has recession struck again? Rich-world economies which account for 60% of global gdp have certainly slowed since the heady days of mid-2021 when covid restrictions were being lifted Goldman Sachs produces a “current activity indicator” a high-frequency measure of economic health based on a range of indicators The gauge has slowed in recent weeks see chart 1 Surveys of factory bosses in America and the euro zone by s&p Global a data provider suggest that manufacturers are gloomier than at any time since the early days of the pandemicIt looks too soon though to declare a recessioneven if as some expect statisticians reveal after we go to press on July 28th that between April and June American gdp contracted for the second quarter running This would count as a recession by one rule of thumb but not necessarily by others A series of oddities led gdp to shrink in the first quarter even though the underlying performance of the economy was strong It would also be too soon for Fed tightening to have had an effectMost economists look to America National Bureau of Economic Research nber to find out if the economy is truly in recession Its business-cycle-dating committee considers indicators beyond gdp in making that judgment including jobs numbers and industrial production The Economist has used a similar approach with a little guesswork for the rich world as a whole Many indicators still point to expansion see chart 2 It is hard to argue that a recession has arrivedYet with growth clearly slowing the big question is how bad things will get The few remaining optimists point to the strength of households and firms The public is even gloomier about the economy than it was during the depths of both the global financial crisis and the pandemic see chart 3 But households in the rich world probably still have some $3trn or so in “excess” savings accumulated during the pandemic In America the cash balances of poor households were 70% higher in March than they were in 2019 according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute a bank-affiliated think-tank Moreover people seem more confident about their personal finances than about the state of the economy Across the eu households are about one-third more likely to be positive about their own finances than they have been on average since the data began in the mid-1980s In America an unusually low share of people believe they will be unable to meet debt commitments over the next three months Consumer-spending trackers including from the Bank of England for Britain and JPMorgan Chase for America still look fairly strong Governments are also handing out money to help poorer people cope with roaring energy prices In the euro zone governments are stimulating the economy by the equivalent of about 1% of gdp Britain has offered handouts to poor households In May the Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank reckoned that such spending would largely compensate the poorest households for the rising cost of living though retail energy prices are now likely to rise further still The behaviour of businesses is also reassuring Across rich economies the number of job vacancies is still near a record high In Australia they are more than twice their pre-pandemic level according to data from Indeed a hiring website In America there are more than two open positions for every unemployed person As a result labour markets remain tight You can find some evidence of rising joblessness in the Czech Republic if you squint Overall though the unemployment rate across the oecd club of mostly rich countries is lower now than it was just before the pandemic In half of oecd countries the share of working-age people who are in a joba broader measure of labour-market healthis at an all-time high If history is any guide these figures are inconsistent with a looming recessionFear uncertainty and doubt Declines in investment have in the past played a big role in downturns In recessionary periods since the 1980s for the g7 group of large economies around half the fall in combined gdp in negative quarters came from shrinking capital spending This time investment data have weakened but not catastrophically so according to data compiled by JPMorgan for America the euro zone and Japan Until recently capital spending was booming as firms spent big on remote-working technology and reinforced supply chains Now some believe they have overinvested in capacity Others want to conserve cash An analysis of survey evidence credit conditions and corporate liquidity by Oxford Economics a consultancy suggests that investment in the g7 could decline at an annualised pace of around 05% in the second half of this year That is not good but it is not enough to create a recession by itself The investment declines in past downturns were steeperUnfortunately there is a limit to the confidence that can be taken from good economic data when the fundamental fear of investors is monetary tightening News of any kind it seems can convey bad news about a recession Weak figures confirm that a downturn is approaching Strong data including wage rises suggest central banks are not succeeding in slowing things down requiring further tightening which in turn stands to provoke a recession Only signs that inflation is falling will truly dispel fears of a downturnThere is some relief ahead A gauge of supply-chain snarls compiled by the New York Fed comprising global transport costs among other things has eased American petrol prices are now falling by 3% a week Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy constructs a “news inflation pressure index” which indicates whether the flow of news articles suggests price pressures are building up The indices for America and Britain have fallen of lateBut hopes for a rapid fall in inflation are almost certain to be dashed Past increases in the price of food and energy have not yet fully filtered into headline inflation rates: Morgan Stanley reckons that rich-world inflation will peak at 8% in the third quarter of 2022 Growth in wages shows little sign of easing In earnings calls companies still talk about how best to pass on higher costs to their customers The mass of data confronting economists is useful but an old lesson may still hold: that recessions are hard to spot in real time The nber dates the start of America downturn associated with the global financial crisis to December 2007 Even in August 2008 the Fed staff thought the economy was still growing at an annual pace of about 2% The post-lockdown picture is particularly difficult to interpret Barely anyone thought labour shortages would emerge last year or that inflation would go from bad to worse in 2022 That is the case for pessimism The case for optimism is that the present episode of monetary tightening has only just begun Before it bites there is time for a volatile world economy to deliver more surprisesperhaps even positive ones For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Jul 21st 2022,The ECB latest attempt to hold the euro zone together,IT WAS ALMOST ten years to the day since Mario Draghi then the president of the European Central Bank ended the most acute phase of the euro-zone crisis with the assurance that he would do “whatever it takes” to keep the currency bloc together Now with risks of a fresh debt crisis looming Christine Lagarde his successor as ecb president unveiled the bank latest attempt to make good on that promise The Transmission Protection Instrument tpi announced on July 21st is a bond-buying scheme intended to prevent the spread in borrowing costs between euro-zone governments from widening so far that troubled countries would be at risk of a forced exit from the currencyThe need for such a tool is apparent Shortly before the central bank meeting Mr Draghi resigned as Italy prime minister a role he had unexpectedly taken up last year at the head of an unwieldy coalition The turmoil in Rome placed further pressure on Italian bonds which were already facing higher interest rates amid a potential economic slowdown Rising bond yields risk trapping Italy in a self-reinforcing cycle of higher borrowing costs worries over the sustainability of its debt and ultimately fears that the third-largest economy in the euro zone could not survive inside it The unlimited asset purchases and potentially unlimited latitude for ECB intervention promised by the tpi should alleviate those worries The instrument is open-ended in size allowing the central bank to buy as many assets as it sees fit including not just government bonds but also those from the private sector Any sell-off in government debt would have to be “disorderly and unjustified” for the ECB to take actionbut the bank has claimed unlimited discretion to define these terms for itself Ms Lagarde said that the ECB has the “sovereignty” to determine eligibility criteria itself a word not often heard from the mouths of central bankersThe ECB has left itself much less flexibility however when it comes to determining which countries are eligible for the scheme To win tpi support governments must not be subject to the excessive deficit procedure edp a mechanism used by the European Commission to enforce the euro area fiscal rules; nor the eu excessive imbalance procedure which assesses a broader set of macroeconomic indicators A country public debt must be “sustainable” and its fiscal policies “sound” But in making these judgments the ECB said it will take into account the views of other organisations including the imfThe ECB has therefore given itself the maximum room for manoeuvre in forestalling any repeat of the euro-zone crisis while handing to others the politically delicate task of deciding whether governments’ fiscal policies are appropriate and their debt sustainable This in turn raises the stakes for the commission when deciding whether to place countries into the edp: an assessment that a troubled country has breached the fiscal rules now risks making it ineligible for monetary support That could provoke a flight from its debt as well as confrontation with BrusselsSuch is the price of consensus Ms Lagarde boasted that the tpi won unanimous backing in the ECB often-fractious governing council Hawks had worried that the scheme would prevent markets from disciplining poorly run governments and making accurate appraisals of their solvency Doves fretted that making it too strict would render it pointless The ecb separate decision to raise rates from -05% to 0%its first increase in over a decade and a larger one than investors had been led to expect by the bank itselfmay also have helped the hawks on the council reconcile themselves with such a big intervention in government-bond markets Either way Italy borrowing costs fell after the meeting as investors digested the details of the scheme The euro zone faces a difficult few months with energy bills soaring a potential hard-right government taking office in Italy and Russia war in Ukraine continuing to fuel economic uncertainty But making “whatever it takes” subject to the economic judgments of the Eurocrats in Brussels may be enough for now 
 Jul 21st 2022,Dollar-euro parity may be justified But the yen looks cheap as chips,Imagine you are a Parisian investor trying to decide whether to buy American or European bonds You compare the yields on offer A ten-year bond issued by America Treasury today offers 3%; German bunds return only 12% But buying American means taking a gamble on the euro-dollar exchange rate You are interested in the return in euros The bond issued in Washington will be attractive only if the extra yield exceeds any expected loss owing to swings in currency marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis thinking known as “uncovered interest parity” uip explains why the dollar has recently soared against the euro On July 12th the greenback reached a one-for-one exchange rate with the euro for the first time since 2002 It has since fallen slightly uip posits that changes in interest rates drive currency movements If yields on Treasuries rise relative to those on bunds then the dollar should strengthen until investors expect it to fall over the lifetime of the bonds so that there is no longer any extra return from buying Treasuries The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates above 35% in 2023 more than twice the rate expected to be reached by the European Central Bank The dollar has also risen by 20% against the yen in 2022 so far That is probably because the Bank of Japan is not expected to raise rates above 02% in the next three yearsYet there is more to currency valuation than monetary policy Another theory purchasing-power parity ppp says currencies and prices should adjust until a basket of goods and services costs the same everywhere The Economist has its own lighthearted measure of ppp: the Big Mac index which was updated on July 20th Instead of a basket of goods and services it uses differences in the price of the ubiquitous McDonald burger to judge whether currencies are over- or undervaluedOur measure suggests the weak euro may be justified see chart The headline index which assumes Big Macs should cost the same everywhere predicts an exchange rate of 111 dollars per euro But a secondary index which adjusts for differences in gdp says the euro should trade just below dollar parity The gdp-adjusted index takes into account differences in the prices of inputs such as land and labour that are hard or impossible to trade across borders and therefore reflect local incomes At dollar-euro parity a Big Mac is 11% more expensive stateside But because America is richer than Europe such a difference in prices could make senseFor the euro then the two theories of currency valuation look aligned Not so for the yen which is more than 40% undervalued against the dollar on both Big Mac indices Book that flight to Tokyo American burger-lovers The yen has become more undervalued since January both because the dollar has surged and because inflation is much higher in America A Big Mac in Japan including taxes costs ¥390 a price that has not changed since 2018 The American price $515 has gone up by 115% in that time and by 22% since January That uip is explaining recent movements better than ppp is no surprise When exchange rates get out of whack with interest rates traders can make a profit at the touch of a button To the extent that varying purchasing power presents opportunities it is to people and firms who might change the site of production or ship goods across borders That takes time And it is not always possible: the international delivery of Big Macs would be ill-advisedppp can fail even within currency zones Our new index incorporates a change to the source for American Big Mac prices We used to collect an average price from restaurants in four cities: Atlanta Chicago New York and San Francisco These are relatively expensive places Now we use a median price for the whole country provided by McDonald which is lower The result is that the dollar does not look quite as strong The change has been made for the whole history of the index though the previous version is available online We have also refined our method for calculating the gdp-adjusted index Fans of burgernomics should tuck in To view an interactive visualisation of The Economist Big Mac index go to economistcom/big-mac-indexFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 21st 2022,Should central banks’ inflation targets be raised?,When new zealand parliament decided in December 1989 on a 2% inflation target for the country central bank none of the lawmakers dissented perhaps because they were keen to head home for the Christmas break Rather than being the outcome of intense economic debate the figurewhich was the first formal target to be adopted by a central bankowes its origin to an offhand remark by a former finance minister who suggested that the soon-to-be-independent central bank should aim for either zero or 1% inflation The central-bank chief and incumbent finance minister used that as a starting-point before plumping for 0-2% Over time 2% became the standard across the rich worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKShould the somewhat arbitrary goal of 2% be changed? The question may seem a little churlish when central banks are so flagrantly missing their existing targets: annual inflation in America Britain and the euro area for instance is running at around 9% The Federal Reserve experiment with “flexible average-inflation targeting” has coincided with the central bank allowing inflation to get out of hand Yet it is possible that raising the target might help prevent rich countries from returning to the low-inflation low-growth malaise that was the rule for the decade after the global financial crisis The idea therefore warrants consideration High inflation is painful Even if wages keep pace with price growth thereby preserving workers’ incomes in real terms it undermines the function of money both as a unit of account and as a store of value Contracts agreed at one point in time lose their worth rapidly redistributing income and wealth arbitrarily between buyers and sellers or between creditors and debtors Long-term investment and saving decisions become more of a gamble as the case of Turkey illustrates Inflation there is in the region of 80% Yet deflation carries its own costs too Worryingly for mortgage-holders and governments alike it raises the value of debts in real terms which can generate a self-sustaining depression as incomes keep falling relative to debt payments That explains why central banks aim for a low but positive rate of inflation Deciding which low but positive number is desirable is trickier Is a target of 2% actually superior to one of 3% or 4% for instance or does it merely owe its exalted status to tradition? The relative damage done by extremely high or accelerating price growth may be easily visible but economists have struggled to identify differences in the costs to an economy from different stable low-single-digit inflation rates The 20-year period of very low inflation that recently came to an end brought no positive leap forward in productivity nor any change in savings behaviour except in reaction to the global financial crisis points out Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank in Washington If the costs of a slightly higher inflation target are small the benefits are potentially sizeable Chiefly it could help central bankers avoid the so-called zero lower bound on nominal interest rates Interest rates cannot go too far into negative territory because they risk destabilising the banking system: depositors could always choose to empty their bank accounts and hold cash which in effect carries an interest rate of zero instead That also limits the efficacy of negative interest rates After the financial crisis some central banks set slightly negative rates on commercial banks’ reserves but lenders had little ability to pass them on to their retail clients The impotence of negative interest rates encouraged central banks to adopt unconventional policies such as quantitative easing Higher inflation targets are a different solution to the problem of the lower bound If the public expects the central bank to generate more inflation in future then the interest rate in real terms can still be sharply negative stimulating the economy even without nominal interest rates needing to venture below zero Allowing moderately higher inflation in normal times could therefore make it easier for the central bank to give a boost to the economy when trouble hitsThe opportunity to escape the lower bound on interest rates is no small thing The current spell of monetary-policy tightening notwithstanding the risk remains that interest rates will stay relatively low The long-term factors that were weighing on interest rates before the pandemic such as an ageing population and low productivity growth are still in place There may be a benefit in the short term too to raising targets now Reducing stubbornly high inflation requires cooling the economy which generally involves raising the unemployment rate The lower the inflation target the more unemployment central banks need to generate to get there If the costs of inflation at 3% really are not much different from inflation at 2% central banks will be generating additional unemployment for little benefit Seizing the inflationary momentSet against this however are the consequences of reneging on a 30-year promise The experience of the past year has made clear that the public detests inflation; both finance ministries and central banks are being excoriated for losing control of price growth To shift the goalposts now could give the impression of giving up the fight entirely Inflation targeting was meant to anchor the public expectations of price growth Changing the target could undermine that objective altogether by creating expectations that it will be raised again the next time inflation roars As long as inflation is so far off-target such considerations seem likely to stay the hand of any would-be monetary reformers Yet once it peaks restoring a degree of central banks’ credibility the pain of further disinflation together with the promise of well and truly escaping the zero lower bound could just start to make the idea of higher targets more alluring For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Inflation shows both the value and limits of monetary-policy rules Jul 14thAre central banks in emerging markets now less of a slave to the Fed?

 Jul 21st 2022,The Fed put morphs into a Fed call,When stocks boomed early in the pandemic an internet meme captured the madness of the moment On the left-hand side of the image a worried man exclaims that simply creating money cannot save the economy; on the right a man representing the Federal Reserve replies “Haha money printer go brrr” while cranking out dollars Joseph Politano author of Apricitas an economics newsletter recently tweaked the meme to better fit the present situation On the left the worried man laments that excessive monetary tightening is increasing the risk of a recession; to the right the Fed representative retorts “Haha money vacuum go brrr” while hoovering up dollarsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn more analytical if less humorous terms another way of framing this shift is to ask whether the Fed put has become a Fed call The concept of a Fed put dates back to the era of Alan Greenspan a former chairman of the central bank Starting with the stockmarket crash in 1987 and continuing for more than three decades the Fed earned a reputation for easing policy notably by cutting interest rates whenever share prices plunged To traders this looks a bit like a put option a basic hedging tool that sets a price floor for investments A Fed call would imply just the opposite: namely that the central bank is in effect capping the market similar to traders who sell call options on their stock holdings Steve Englander of Standard Chartered a bank laid out this provocative idea in a recent note to clients: “The Fed may push back against equity market gains until it is comfortable that disinflation is a lockin other words [there is] a Fed call”This argument may at first glance seem rather crude The Fed has long denied that it targets asset prices in setting monetary policy Narrowly its denials are credible Central bankers look at oodles of data from real-time growth figures to surveys of inflation expectations They cannot afford to be swayed by swings in stocks Moreover share prices reflect many factors ranging from the overall economic outlook to corporate idiosyncrasies Why would the Fed target something that is so volatile and only partially responsive to its actions?In a broader sense however the stockmarket clearly matters to the Fed Jerome Powell its current chairman has repeatedly said that its policies are transmitted to the real economy through financial conditionsa term that refers to the availability and cost of funding for businesses and consumers Stockmarkets play a crucial role in both shaping and gauging financial conditions Admittedly they play a small part in a formal sense: for instance in one index of financial conditions created by the Fed Chicago branch equity and other asset markets account for just ten of its 105 separate inputs contrasting with the bigger weights assigned to credit markets But stocks reflect these other metrics This is especially true at times of stress Share prices have fallen this year as indices of financial conditions have tightened and they have risen when these indices have easedConcerns about inflation only add to the market importance When share prices rise consumers feeling flush tend to spend more money and companies feeling confident tend to hire more workers A paper in 2019 by Gabriel Chodorow-Reich of Harvard University and colleagues concluded that each dollar of increased stockmarket wealth lifted consumer spending by about three cents annually while also boosting employment and wages For a central bank fighting inflation a large rise in share prices would therefore cut against its effortsThis makes for borderline hypocrisy in Fedspeak Sober central bankers can explain that they want “appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions” to help rectify the supply-and-demand imbalances that are fuelling inflation as the Fed did indeed say in the minutes of its rate-setting meeting in June Yet it would be beyond the pale for them to declare that they want “appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated weakness in the stockmarket”even if their meanings are closely alignedIn a market crash that impairs the financial system the Fed put would come back into focus For now though the sell-off has been mostly orderly A sustained rebound in stocks would be unwelcome for the Fed and might well tilt it towards more hawkishness Investors accustomed to viewing the central bank as a friendly force must instead confront the harsh reality of a Fed callFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why markets really are less certain than they used to be Jul 14thCrypto last man standing Jul 9thWhat past market crashes have looked like Jun 30th

 Jul 20th 2022,The 53 fragile emerging economies,For a fleeting moment the protesters seemed to be having a good time On July 9th some of the thousands of Sri Lankans who had taken to the streets to express frustration at the country economic crisis stormed into the president residence where they cooked took selfies and swam in the pool Not long after word came that the president Gotabaya Rajapaksa had fled and would resign His successor Ranil Wickremesinghe until recently the prime minister inherits a mess In April Sri Lanka declared that it could no longer service its foreign debt Its government has sought aid from India and Russia to pay for essential imports The economy is likely to shrink dramatically this year In June annual inflation climbed to 55% If the government is unable to stabilise the situation the country may yet succumb to hyperinflation and further political chaos Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scenes in Sri Lanka may be a sign of things to come elsewhere Debt loads across poorer countries stand at the highest levels in decades Squeezed by the high cost of food and energy a slowing global economy and a sharp increase in interest rates around the world emerging economies are entering an era of intense macroeconomic pain Some countries face years of difficult budget choices and weak growth Others may sink into economic and political crisis All told 53 countries look most vulnerable: they either are judged by the imf to have unsustainable debts or to be at high risk of having them; have defaulted on some debts already; or have bonds trading at distressed levelsToday bleak situation has an analogue in the desperate years of the 1980s and 1990s Then as now a long period of robust growth and easy financial conditions was followed by leaner times and rising debt burdens Macroeconomic shocks rising inflation and eventually soaring interest rates in the rich world pushed many heavily indebted poor economies over the fiscal cliff In August 1982 Mexico government announced that it could no longer service its foreign debt More than three dozen countries had fallen behind on their debts before the year was out By 1990 roughly 6% of the world public debt was in defaultMuch has changed since Many governments opened up to trade liberalised their economies and pursued more disciplined macroeconomic policy Faster growth and better policy led to broad improvements in the fiscal health of emerging economies By 2008 as rich countries sank into an intense financial crisis of their own the level of public debt across poorer economies stood at just 33% of gdpThis allowed them to engage with the global financial system in a manner more like the rich world Most emerging-market governments hoping to tap global capital used to have little choice but to borrow in a foreign currency a risky step that could quickly transform home-currency depreciation into a full-blown crisis Around the turn of the millennium about 85% of new debt issued outside America Europe and Japan was not denominated in the borrower currency But by 2019 roughly 80% of outstanding bonds across the emerging world were denominated in local currencyAs emerging economies’ financial systems matured their governments became better able to tap domestic capital markets The crises of the 1980s and 1990s also taught them the value of stockpiling foreign-exchange reserves; global reserves rose from less than 10% of world gdp in 2005 to 15% in 2020 It was thanks largely to these adjustments that most emerging markets weathered the slow growth of the 2010s and the shock of the pandemic Only six governments defaulted in 2020including Argentina for the ninth time Ecuador and Lebanonequivalent to just 05% of outstanding global public debt But this greater resilience also allowed governments to rack up more borrowing In 2019 public debt stood at 54% of gdp across the emerging world The pandemic then led to an explosion in borrowing In 2020 emerging economies ran an average budget deficit of 93% of gdp not far off the 105% run by rich economies Borrowing stabilised in 2021 as economies rebounded But the picture has grown darker this year The jump in food and energy prices that followed Russia invasion of Ukraine is depressing growth across most of the world increasing debt burdens Rising import bills have drained hard currency from many vulnerable placesincluding Sri Lankaeroding their capacity to service foreign debts Conditions will probably deteriorate as rich-world central banks continue to raise interest rates Hawkish turns by the Federal Reserve tend to diminish risk appetite and draw capital out of emerging markets leaving overextended borrowers high and dryAnd Fed policy has not been this hawkish for some time The federal-funds rate is expected to approach 35% by the end of this year which along with the unwinding of some recent asset purchases would constitute the Fed sharpest tightening since the early 1980s The emerging world has thus experienced net capital outflows every month since March according to the Institute of International Finance an industry group The dollar has risen by over 12% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year and is up by far more against many emerging-market currencies As funding conditions have worsened borrowing costs for some governments have soared About a quarter of the low- and middle-income issuers of debt face yield spreads over American Treasuries of ten percentage points or morea level considered distressed see chart 1The combination of heavy debt burdens slowing global growth and tightening financial conditions will be more than some governments can bear One set of potential victims comprises the poorest economies which have been less able to borrow in relatively safe waysin their own currencies for exampleand which because of the pandemic were already vulnerable Among 73 low-income countries eligible for debt relief under a g20 initiative eight carry public-debt loads which the imf has deemed to be unsustainable and another 30 are at high risk of falling into such a situation Debt problems in these countries pose little threat to the global economy; together their gdp is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium Yet they are home to nearly 500m people whose fates depend on whether their governments can afford to invest in basic infrastructure and public servicesThen there are the troubled middle-income economies in the mould of Sri Lanka which are more integrated into the global financial system and which through policy missteps and bad luck have found themselves exposed Overall 15 countries are either in default or have sovereign bonds trading at distressed levels They include Egypt El Salvador Pakistan and Tunisia Home discomforts More middle-income countries may be better insulated against deteriorating global conditions than they were in the past Still the imf reckons that about 16% of emerging-market public debt is denominated in foreign currencies And the places that are more insulated have in many cases become so by funding borrowing through local banks That however raises the possibility that any credit stress experienced by a government also feeds through to its banking system which could in turn impair lending or even lead to outright crisis Across the emerging world reckons the imf the share of public debt held by domestic banks has climbed over the past two decades to about 17% of gdp more than twice the level in rich economies Sovereign-debt holdings as a share of total bank assets stand at 26% in Brazil and 29% in India and above 40% in Egypt and PakistanJust how big this group eventually gets and how serious the spillovers are to the rest of the world depends on whether bigger economies like Brazil and Turkey are ensnared by crisis Both have muddled through so far despite some vulnerabilities but poor policy could push them towards the brinkAs a commodity exporter Brazil has benefited from higher food and energy prices Its hefty pile of foreign-exchange reserves has so far reassured markets The president Jair Bolsonaro trails in the polls ahead of an election due in October though and has loosened the country purse strings in an attempt to win support adding to the country heavy debt load He has also suggested that he may not obey voters should they decide to toss him out If he spooks markets an outflow of capital could at the very least leave the economy facing a severe fiscal crunch and recessionTurkey has a dynamic economy and a modest level of public debt But it owes a lot to foreigners relative to its available currency reserves And its president Recep Tayyip Erdogan insists that the central bank keeps interest rates unduly low in the face of soaring inflationwhich has climbed to near 80% The lira has crashed in value over the past four years Without a policy change the government could face a balance-of-payments crisisNeither of the world largest emerging markets China and India is at high risk of an external crisis Both have intimidating piles of foreign-exchange reserves China government wields close control over both capital flows and the domestic financial system which should allow it to contain panic while India is only minimally reliant on foreign funding Both however carry enormous public-debt loads by historical standards And both matter enough to the global economy that a period of deleveraging that depressed growth and investment could have big knock-on effectsTaken together then 53 low- and middle-income countries are already experiencing debt troubles or are at high risk of doing so Their economic size is modesttheir combined output amounts to 5% of world gdpbut they are home to 14bn people or 18% of the world population see chart 2 And worryingly there are few options available to ward off crisis An end to the war in Ukraine seems a distant prospect A growth rebound in China or elsewhere could be a double-edged sword: it would boost growth but also contribute to inflation leading to further rate rises in the rich worldDebt relief would help Roughly a third of the massive debts owed by middle-income economies in the 1980s was forgiven under a plan put together by Nicholas Brady then America Treasury secretary in 1989 Additional relief was provided to 37 very poor countries through an initiative organised by the imf and World Bank in 1996 The g20 took similar steps during the pandemic first with the Debt Service Suspension Initiative through which more than 70 countries were eligible to defer debt payments and then through the Common Framework which was intended to provide a blueprint for broader reliefYet the framework has failed to gain traction Only three countries have so far sought help under it and none has completed the process Prospects for improving the scheme or for reaching agreement on debt relief have been dimmed by the fact that lending by Paris Club countriesrich economies that have agreed to co-operate in dealing with unsustainable debtshas become less important while loans from private creditors and big emerging markets China in particular have become more so In 2006 Paris Club economies and multilateral bodies accounted for more than 80% of poor countries’ foreign obligations Today they account for less than 60% of poor-country debt Nearly a fifth is owed to China aloneIndeed work by Sebastian Horn and Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute and Carmen Reinhart of Harvard University helps illustrate how massive and murky a force Chinese lending has become They reckon that almost half of China lending abroad is unreported such that their estimates of China claims on foreign governments probably understate the true figures Even so they reckon that from 1998 to 2018 China foreign lending the bulk of which has gone to low- and middle-income economies rose from almost nothing to the equivalent of nearly 2% of world gdp And among the 50 economies most in hock to China obligations to Chinese institutions amount to 15% of gdp on average or about 40% of external debtMore than a third of the world most debt-distressed countries also number among those most indebted to Chinese lenders As of 2017 the debt owed to China by Kenya amounted to 10% of the latter gdp and by Laos a staggering 28% China is also a big creditor of Sri Lanka which owed it the equivalent of 8% of gdp in 2017 and Pakistan 9% Many indebted economies are loth to ask for debt relief from China fearing the wrath of its leadership or a loss of access to future funding and Chinese institutions have tended to prefer reprofiling debts to outright relief Deteriorating relations between China and the West meanwhile have reduced the scope for co-operation in handling debt problems In the 1980s emerging-market defaults on loans owed to American banks pushed some financial institutions to the brink of insolvency Residents of rich economies may take some comfort from the fact that their lenders are less exposed today But for the billion or more people living in countries at risk of distress the pain will be only too drawn out both as fiscal woes infect local banks and as negotiations over external debt prove intractable For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our

quotas stop them increasing exports when prices are high One Western oil trader says that planners have been leaning on state oil firms to sell even less abroad Refiners thus have an incentive to do fewer runs when prices are high and to stockpile crude instead “Export controls are a strategy to keep oil in the country in case there a shortage” says Zhou Xizhou of s&p Global a rating agencyAt present there are no shortages But that does not mean the government supply-side measures have had resounding success A big factor in keeping shortages at bay has been the sorry state of the economy and the muted demand for energy Some economists believe China oil demand could be flat this year compared with last year or even lower Optimistic forecasters see the economy recovering later in the year even as growth slows in America and Europe This could lower global energy prices just as China needs to import moreIf factories come roaring back to life earlier than expected however then China energy policy would face a real test Miners refiners and generators could respond to price caps and export bans by reducing supply A particularly cold winter could force buyers of gas into the spot market where prices have rocketed And officials would start to feel the heat For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 14th 2022,Inflation shows both the value and limits of monetary-policy rules,It was a curious omission In February when the Federal Reserve published the winter edition of its semi-annual report to Congress it dropped a normal section outlining the appropriate level of interest rates as determined by “monetary-policy rules” Its inclusion might have been awkward because it would have suggested that rates should be as high as 9% when the Fed still had them near to 0% In subsequent hearings at least three members of Congress pressed Jerome Powell the Fed chairman to explain its absence Mr Powell promised that the section would be back in its next report And so it was when the summer edition was published on June 17ththough only after the Fed had started to catch up to the rules’ prescriptions by rapidly raising ratesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs controversies go the disappearance of a three-page section in a lengthy policy report was rather minor It garnered scant media coverage Nevertheless it was important It shone light on a decades-old question that is being asked with more insistence amid soaring inflation: should central banks limit their discretion and set interest rates according to black-and-white rules?The search for rules to guide and constrain central banks has a long pedigree It dates back to the 1930s when Henry Simons an American economist argued that authorities should aim to maintain “the constancy” of a predetermined price indexa novel idea in his era In the 1960s Milton Friedman called for central banks to increase the money supply by a set amount every year That monetarist rule was influential until the 1980s when the relationship between money supply and gdp broke downAny discussion of rules today conjures up a seminal paper written in 1993 by John Taylor an economist at Stanford University In it he presented a straightforward equation which came to be known as the “Taylor rule” The only variables were the pace of inflation and the deviation of gdp growth from its trend path Plugging these in produced a recommended policy-rate path which over the late 1980s and early 1990s was almost identical to the actual federal-funds rate the overnight lending rate targeted by the Fed So it seemed to have great explanatory power Mr Taylor argued that his rule might help to steer central banks on the right path for rates in the futureHowever just as the Taylor rule started to get attention from economists and investors alike its explanatory power grew weaker In the late 1990s the recommended Taylor rate was consistently lower than the fed-funds rate That sparked a cottage industry of academic research into alternative rules mostly grounded by Mr Taylor original insights Some put more weight on the gdp gap Others added inertia since central banks take time to adjust rates Another group shifted from current inflation to forecasts trying to account for the lag between policy actions and economic outcomes In its reports the Fed usually mentions five separate rules The appeal of rules lies in their cold neutrality: they are swayed only by numbers not by fallible judgment about the economy Central bankers love saying that their policy decisions are dependent on data In practice they sometimes struggle to listen to the data when their message is unpalatable as it has been with inflation for the past year Central bankers found numerous reasons from the supposedly transitory nature of inflation to the limited recovery in the labour market to delay raising rates But throughout that time the suite of rules cited by the Fed was unambiguous in its verdict: tightening was neededThe rules are however not perfectly neutral Someone first has to construct them deciding which elements to include and what weights to ascribe to them Nor are they as tidy as implied by the convention of calling them “simple monetary-policy rules” They are simple in the sense that they contain relatively few inputs But just as a bunch of simple threads can make for one messy knot so a proliferation of simple rules has made for a baffling array of possibilities For example the Cleveland Fed publishes a quarterly report based on a set of seven rules Its most recent report indicated that interest rates should be anywhere between 06% per a rule focused on inflation forecasts and 87% per the original Taylor rulean uncomfortably wide rangeMoreover each rule is built on top of a foundation of assumptions These typically include estimates of the long-term unemployment rate and of the natural interest rate the theoretical rate that supports maximum output for an economy without stoking inflation Modellers must also settle on which of a range of inflation gauges to use Slight changes in any of these inputscommon during periods of economic fluxcan produce big swings in the rates prescribed by the rules For example an adjusted version of the Taylor rule based on core inflation would have recommended an interest-rate increase of a whopping 22 percentage points over the past two years starting from negative 15% Slavishly following such guidance would make for extreme volatility Average eleganceOne possible solution is to combine multiple rules into a single result The Cleveland Fed does just this constructing a basic median out of the seven rules it tracks Using this as a reference point Mr Powell and his colleagues ought to have started raising rates gingerly in the first quarter of 2021 and should have brought them to roughly 4% today more than twice as high as they actually are That is much more sensible as a recommendation than the conclusion yielded by any single policy ruleSuch a median could never substitute for analysis of a range of data by central banks But there is a big difference between taking rules seriously and treating them as holy writ After all the inflation missteps of the past year a healthy sample of rules deserves a closer look in policy debates And they certainly deserve more prominence than they currently get as a short section in monetary reports that the Fed can choose to omit when inconvenient For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

In order to quantify its uniqueness Buttonwood has examined three measures of market-related uncertainty: expected asset-price volatility divergence in economic forecasts and the unpredictability of economic policy as chronicled in the media The tests suggest we really are living in unusual times Start with swings in asset prices In the past month America s&p 500 stock index has been three times more volatile than it was before the pandemic And investors are still jittery The volatility index vixwhich captures investors’ appetite for insuring themselves against future stock-price moveshas hovered at around 25 points since 2020 nearly eight points above its 2010s average That is not unprecedented however Since the 1990s a range of crises from the Gulf war to the dotcom crash have kept the vix near 25 points for monthsThe bond-market hysteria is more unusual The Merrill Lynch Options Volatility Estimate move is a gauge of fear among bond investors It is at levels last seen in March 2020 when the spread of covid-19 caused market panic although it is still lower than during the 2007-09 financial crisis The elevated move reflects the clumsy pivot in central-bank policy On May 4th Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve signalled it was not even considering raising rates by 075 percentage points at its next meetingbefore doing just that six weeks laterCentral bankers have become hard to read for a reason: the macroeconomic oracles on which they partly rely our second gauge are exceptionally dispersed A measure of disagreement among professional forecasters of economic growth surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed is nearly triple its typical 2010s level; it has been above two percentage points for nine consecutive quarters which last occurred between 1979 and 1981 when inflation was in double digits Our third measure of uncertainty that arising from the inscrutable outlook for economic policy indicates lasting change the most clearly An index built by Scott Baker of the Kellogg School of Management and colleagues tracks the frequency of articles that include worrying bundles of wordssuch as “regulatory” “economic” and “uncertainty”in global publications It suggests that economic-policy unpredictability has been rising steadily since the financial crisis and is now far higher than in the late 1990s when the index began That our indicators are flashing red at the same time suggests an enduring step-up in uncertainty from which it may be hard to climb down Furthermore the different types of uncertainty reinforce each other Political polarisation which tends to make economic policy erratic is fuelled by high inflation All this means the economy is harder to forecast making life harder for central banks in turn spooking investors The fragmentation of global trade doesn’t help The unwinding of supply chains encourages stockpiling during booms and fire-sales during busts amplifying economic swingsPersistent uncertainty means a higher cost of capital and less affordable insurance against shocks All of which tends to dampen business investment weighing on gdp growth and equity returns There have been many dark days for the nasdaq in 2022: the index has already recorded 32 daily falls of more than 2% since January This time their entry on the calendar of doom looks deserved For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Crypto last man standing Jul 9thWhat past market crashes have looked like Jun 30thHow attractively are shares now priced?

 Jul 14th 2022,The ECB masterplan to manipulate markets,Financial markets are supposed to follow a strict division of labour The central bank sets the risk-free rate to stimulate or cool the overall economy but it is “market-neutral”: it does not favour any asset over another Private investors choose who to lend to and at what risk premium Combine the two judgments and the economy should have a set of interest rates that reflects economic conditions Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe European Central Bank ecb however thinks markets are not doing their jobor at least not the way it wants It is preparing to intervene in two novel ways: by limiting what it deems an acceptable difference or spread in rates between sovereign borrowers; and by greening its bond purchases and banking rules In doing so it will abandon market neutrality and discriminate between assetsStart with sovereign spreads On July 21st the ecb is expected to unveil a new tool meant to prevent borrowing costs among euro-zone governments from diverging too much The aim is to ensure that monetary-policy decisions work similarly across the bloc If rising rates say led to ballooning spreads with the extra costs transmitted to private borrowers some regions might feel a bigger squeeze than others The currency union has a history of such divergence During the euro crisis between 2011 and 2015 a bigger spread between sovereigns also meant tighter financial conditions for private firms and households Yet some argue that the ecb mooted tool is not needed today Europe has cleaned up its banks; the ecb has pledged to do whatever it takes to save the euro In the private sector fragmentation is less of an issue: lending rates to firms in Italy are at the level they were before the euro crisis relative to Germany despite widening sovereign spreads Moreover the policy looks tricky to implement The ecb will need to define what counts as an “excessive” spread That is hard because economists do not know what the true justified interest rate is for any given bond The tool could encourage vulnerable countries to borrow at will knowing the ecb is capping their spreads So strings may have to be attached And if it is deemed akin to monetary financing which is barred under the Maastricht treaty it may stumble in the courtsStill the ecb is likely to forge ahead There is an emerging consensus that in a diverse monetary union managing sovereign spreads is part of monetary policy Increasingly the ecb also sees as its duty to curb the financial risks of climate changeits second break away from market neutrality On July 4th the bank said it would “tilt” its corporate-bond buying towards issuers “with better climate performance” The central bank is also making it harder to pledge carbon-intensive assets as collateral for loans from the central bankThe ecb‘s neutrality was always a myth says Pierre Monnin an economist at the Council on Economic Policies a think-tank in Zurich Market-based estimates of risk are inevitably flawed when it comes to climate change because no comprehensive system of carbon pricing exists By failing to correct for unpriced “externalities”harms imposed by borrowers on third partiesthe ecb nominally neutral stance in fact reinforced such inefficiencies Fossil-fuel firms also rely more on bond financing than renewables But although these arguments are economically sound it is not the traditional role of central banks to price externalities when the government has failed to actAnd are the ecb own risk assessments up to the task? One yardstick is the adequacy of its first climate-stress test whose results were published on July 8th These suggest that 41 of Europe biggest banks could together suffer about €70bn in credit and market losses over the next three years in the event of more frequent natural disasters and a disorderly energy transition That is only around 4% of these banks’ aggregate capital and far less than the €400bn of damage the ecb reckons might hit them in an economic downturnYet the ecb itself admits the stress test is only a “learning exercise” rather than an attempt to find out if the banks have a big-enough buffer to withstand climate chaos Most banks do not have enough data to properly estimate climate losses; many lack the tools for incorporating climate risks into lending decisions The ecb‘s first stab at totting up the potential costs of a messy transition is most probably a gross underestimate By dropping market neutrality the central bank is taking a more political role Whether its visible hand ends up bending markets in the right direction is another question For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter 
 Jul 14th 2022,The legacy of Abe Shinzo will shape Japan economy for years,A little less than eight years is not an especially long tenure for heads of government in much of the world In Japan it is a veritable aeon And two years after the resignation of Abe Shinzo a former prime minister who was assassinated on July 8th the reforms he pushed in office look set to shape Japan economy for years to comeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe current prime minister Kishida Fumio secured a big majority of seats in the upper house of Japan legislature in the election on July 10th His greater focus on equality and redistribution which he calls “New Capitalism” was initially cast as an alternative to Mr Abe vision In reality it will be built on the foundations his predecessor laid out The programme which began after Mr Abe 2012 thumping election victorydubbed Abenomicshad three so-called “arrows” to dislodge Japan from its economic stagnation: flexible fiscal policy monetary expansion and structural reforms Clear positives stand out from Mr Abe record most notably the financial accounts of Japan Inc Reforms to corporate governance encouraged more shareholder-friendly activity and prodded firms to reduce moribund networks of cross-shareholdings Those changes paired with a slump in the yen boosted corporate earnings to record levels see chart An environment friendlier to investors also helped to raise anaemic levels of inward foreign direct investment In 2020 direct investment into Japan was worth 12% of gdp the highest on record There have been stark improvements in the labour market too Japan female employment rates previously low by the standards of rich economies climbed rapidly under Mr Abe At 72% among working-age women the employment rate is now more than ten percentage points above the levels Mr Abe inherited and six percentage points above the American equivalent Kathy Matusi the economist who championed increasing female participation as a way to unlock the productive potential of the Japanese economy credits Abe-era reforms such as mandatory disclosure on gender diversity and more generous salary replacements for new parentsMr Kishida aides now talk less of ditching Abenomics and more of building its legacy When his New Capitalism Council revealed its “grand design” document in May it concluded that the strategy would adhere to the three-arrow framework The strategy focuses rightly on the need to get firms to deploy their excess cash through wage increases or capital investments Stagnant wages have been Abenomics biggest shortcoming At around 266000 yen $1940 per month in May Japan average wage has barely budged in a decade and has actually fallen in real terms Most of the recent rise in female employment reflects growth in part-time jobs that are usually poorly paid This is where Mr Kishida could have the most to offer Regrettably his approach to the issue so far differs little from Mr Abe: tax incentives and browbeating with a bit of a boost for public-sector workersFiscal policy was a troubled area for Mr Abe and is likely to remain one for Mr Kishida Two long-planned but ill-fated increases in Japan sales tax in 2014 and 2019 made fiscal policy a drag on the recovery rather than a boost Spending under Mr Abe was not as flexible as the first arrow label would have suggested After leaving office Mr Abe did convince the party to soften its pledge to balance the primary budget excluding debt-servicing costs by 2025 But Mr Kishida is said to be more concerned about fiscal sustainability His closest advisers have backgrounds in Japan typically hawkish finance ministry Mr Abe support for a more stimulative monetary policy has also lasted beyond his tenure with mixed effects Enormous purchases of bonds and a subsequent policy to directly fix the yields of government bonds may have prevented Japan from falling back into deflation but failed to stimulate inflation or nominal-income growth as desired As inflation rises globally the Bank of Japan may find it harder to keep policy easy But Mr Kishida will likely pick a continuity candidate when Kuroda Haruhiko Mr Abe central-bank governor leaves office next AprilWith Mr Abe gone might Mr Kishida feel liberated to diverge further from his predecessor? Different global conditions could fuel such a change Concern about fiscal discipline has more truck in a world of rising interest rates But the differences between Mr Abe and Mr Kishida approach now look more likely to be a matter of degree rather than substance Mr Kishida focus on wages in particular could augment the successes of Abenomics if properly pursued Mr Abe arrows in short will remain essential weapons For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 13th 2022,American inflation tops forecasts yet again adding to recession risks,At this point upside surprises in inflation occur with such frequency that surprise is probably the wrong word for them So it was with America consumer price index cpi for June published on July 13th It soared 91% compared with a year earlier marking yet another four-decade high and beating forecasts for an 88% increase Still investors seemed to be caught unawares with stocks falling sharply after the data adding to this year big losses The pessimism in financial markets is easily understood: persistently high inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to press on with aggressive monetary tightening even at the potential cost of a recessionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAll the more important therefore to understand how persistent inflation will be In this respect the most concerning part of the latest data was not the shocking headline figure about half of which could be attributed to oil and gas prices which surged early in June but have since ebbed Rather it was the change in core prices stripping out volatile food and energyCore inflation rose 07% in June from May the highest month-on-month increase in a year And it was not a blip: over the past three months core inflation has been running at an annualised rate of nearly 8% an indication of the breadth of price pressures see chart Just about everythingfrom cars to clothing and furniture to rentsis getting more expensiveThat reinforces investors’ belief that the Fed will stay on its hawkish path A day before the inflation data bond-market pricing implied that the Fed would raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at its next rate-setting meeting in late July the second straight increase of that size Following the data bond pricing put the chances at roughly 50-50 that it would instead opt for a full percentage point increase Either way it puts the Fed on track for the steepest monetary tightening in a calendar year since 1981 when Paul Volcker was at the central bank helm That is already weighing on economic growthAmerica is hardly alone in struggling with high prices Inflation in the euro area is expected to have risen to 86% in June But the details are different Europe problems are more closely linked to surging gas costs both exacerbating the risk of an imminent recession and perhaps limiting the European Central Bank scope for rate increases That has hurt the euro which has fallen by more than 10% since the start of the year bringing it to parity with the dollar for the first time in two decadesThe White House has tried to put as positive a gloss as possible on the figures Before the data release it drew attention to the recent decline in petrol prices The national average is now about $463 per gallon 5% lower than in June With the price of crude down by even more that does probably set the stage for a lower inflation reading in July Moreover President Joe Biden advisers have noted that an alternative gauge of inflation the personal-consumption-expenditure pce price index which is usually seen as more reliable by the Fed has been more mutedNeither argument is all that reassuring Energy prices have weakened over the past month but with the war in Ukraine dragging on and winter looming they may resume their upward climb before long As for pce inflation it is indeed less extreme than cpi inflation but it is still more than twice as high as the Fed 2% target and rising prices for services such as health care may nudge it higher stillThe best news about inflation is that the Fed tightening is in fact gaining traction in the crucial realm of expectations The Fed cannot solve supply-chain snarls or reduce oil prices Where it can be uniquely effective is in tempering the outlook for prices A basic measure of market expectations for annual inflation over the next five years is now 25% down by more than a percentage point since March In the middle of June a closely watched consumer survey by the University of Michigan put expected annual inflation at 33% for the next five years; by the end of the month it was down to 31% That is precisely what the Fed wants to see Unfortunately economists firms and investors are also busily ratcheting down their expectations for economic growtha consequence the Fed cannot avoid For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jul 12th 2022,How higher interest rates will squeeze government budgets,In recent years government debt appeared to matter less and less even as countries borrowed more and more Falling interest rates made debts cheap to service even as they grew to levels that would have seemed dangerous a generation before The pandemic put both trends into overdrive: the rich world borrowed 105% of its gdp in 2020 and another 73% in 2021 even as long-term bond yields plunged Now central banks are raising interest rates to fight inflation and public debt is becoming more burdensome Our calculations show that government budgets will feel a squeeze far more quickly than is commonly understood Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn May America budget officials raised by a third the forecast cumulative interest bill between 2023 and 2027 to 21% of gdp That is lower than forecast before the pandemic but it is already an underestimate Officials optimistically assumed the federal funds rate would peak at 26% in 2024 but markets now expect the rate to exceed 3% in July 2023 In the euro zone as interest rates have risen the premium indebted countries like Italy must pay to borrow has gone up reflecting the danger that their debts may eventually become too onerous to service Britain officials forecast in March that its government would spend 33% of its gdp servicing its national debt in 2022-23 the highest share since 1988-89 For a given cost of borrowing three main factors determine the cost of servicing legacy debts Two are straightforward: the level of debt and the proportion of it whose value is pegged to inflation or prevailing interest rates Britain debt-service costs have risen so sharply for example because an astonishing one-quarter of its debt is inflation-linkedThe third factor is more complex: the maturity of the debt When governments issue long-dated bonds they lock in the prevailing interest rate In 2020 America Treasury issued about $200bn-worth of 30-year debt at yields of less than 15% for example The more long-dated debt the longer it takes for budgets to take a hit when rates rise The most common measure of this protection the weighted average maturity wam of debt can be a source of comfort Britain in particular has a lot of long-dated bonds: the wam of its bonds and treasury bills is about 15 yearsBut measures of maturity can mislead The wam can be skewed upwards by a small number of very long-dated bonds Issuing 40-year debt instead of 20-year debt raises the wam but does not change the speed with which rising interest rates affect budgets over the next few years The Office for Budget Responsibility obr Britain fiscal watchdog has suggested an alternative measure Suppose you line up every pound or dollar a government has borrowed by the date on which the debt matures Halfway along you would find the median maturitythe date by which half the government borrowing would need to be refinanced at higher rates Call it the interest-rate half-life Though Britain wam is 15 years its interest-rate half-life is lower at about ten yearsThere is another complication Central banks in the rich world have implemented huge quantitative-easing programmes qe under which they have bought trillions of dollars worth of government bonds To do so they have minted fresh electronic money known as central-bank reserves These reserves carry a floating rate of interest the adjustment of which is the main tool of monetary policy When rates rise the cost to central banks of paying interest on the ocean of reserves created under qe rises immediately Raising interest rates thus reduces central-bank profits And because those profits typically flow straight into government coffers taxpayers sufferThe effect of qe is therefore the same as if governments had replaced vast amounts of debt for which the interest rate was locked in with debt carrying a floating rate For most of the history of qe this refinancing operation has been highly profitable because bond markets repeatedly forecast interest rates would rise sooner than they did From 2010 to 2021 the Fed remitted over $1trn to America Treasury qe has been particularly lucrative for central banks in euro-zone countries whose long-term debt is risky and therefore carries a high yield National central banks such as the Bank of Italy carry out most of the ecb qe locally bearing the default risk and earning the yield on the bonds of their respective home states while also paying their share of the ecb interest costs Earning the yield on Italian government debt while paying out much less in interest on reserves helped the Bank of Italy to remit profits worth 04% of gdp to the government in 2020As short-term rates rise profits from qe will gradually dry up and could even turn negative In May the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which manages the Fed qe portfolio projected that interest rates one percentage point above what was expected by market participants in March would be enough to turn the portfolio net income negative for a short timea scenario that today looks likely Another percentage point on interest rates would lead to negative net income for two to three years A full accounting of interest-rate sensitivity must thus adjust for the holdings of central banks treating the associated debt as carrying a floating rate of interest Refreshing the obr calculations we find that qe reduces Britain interest-rate half-life to just two years meaning 50% of Britain government liabilities will roll on to new interest rates by late-2024 We have also replicated the exercise for bonds and bills issued by governments in America France Italy and Japan see chart For France and Italy the interest-rate half-life is an estimate The central banks involved disclose which bonds they hold and the wam of their holdings but do not reveal how much they have bought of each bond issuance Our calculations assume they hold a flat proportion of each bond outstanding value which in both cases produces a portfolio whose wam roughly matches the disclosureIn every case the interest-rate half-life is much lower than the reassuring wam Most striking are the results for Japan and Italy which have the highest debts Because the Bank of Japan has replaced nearly half the Japanese bond market with its reserves the interest-rate half-life is vanishingly short Thankfully inflation in Japan is only 25% and expected to fall There is little pressure to raise interest rates The same cannot be said for the euro zone where the ecb is projected to raise rates rapidly so as to tame inflation It is often noted that Italy huge debts of over 150% of gdp at least carry a wam of over seven years But Italy will in fact inherit higher funding costs quickly because its interest-rate half-life is little more than two years Were the ecb policy rates to reach 3% the Bank of Italy share of the interest costs would immediately rise by an annual 12% of gdp Every one percentage point increase in the financing costs on the €462bn of debt net of central banks’ estimated holdings coming due by July 2024 would cost the government another 03% of gdp annually Is there any way for indebted countries to avoid higher interest costs? It might seem tempting to unwind qe faster by selling bonds rather than waiting for them to mature as several central banks are currently doing But selling bonds would cause central banks to book capital losses because rising yields have eroded the value of their bondholdings At the end of March the Fed unaudited financial statements showed an unrealised capital mark-down of $458bn on its qe portfolio since the start of the year; Paul Kupiec and Alex Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tank estimate that the hole has since grown to about $540bnAnother option is to find a way for central banks to pay less interest on reserves A recent report by Frank Van Lerven and Dominic Caddick of the New Economics Foundation a British think-tank calls for them to pay interest on only a sliver of reserves that affects their decision-making rather than the whole lot The ecb and the Bank of Japan already have such a “tiered” system It was designed to protect commercial banks from the negative interest rates they have imposed in recent yearsUsing tiering to avoid paying banks interest while their funding costs went up would be a tax in disguise Banks considered together have no choice but to hold the reserves qe has force-fed into the system Compelling them to do it for nothing would be a form of financial repression which may impair banks’ ability to lend It would “transfer the costs [of rising rates] to the banking sector” Sir Paul Tucker a former deputy governor of the Bank of England told parliament in 2021 A third option is to tolerate high inflation rather than raise rates Despite rising interest costs many countries’ debt-to-gdp ratios will fall this year as inflation eats into the real value of their debts Many prominent economists have argued that an inflation target of 3% or 4% would be better than one of 2% For now the idea is pie-in-the-sky Central banks are too worried about their credibility to switch targets and with good reason: break your promises on inflation once and people may wonder if you will do it again But because making the switch would deliver a one-time fiscal windfall at the expense of long-term bondholders and because inflation can be painful to get down it could eventually appeal to indebted governmentsWhether it is banks taxpayers or bondholders somebody has to pay the bills that are now falling due Soaring interest costs will further squeeze government budgets already under pressure from higher energy costs rising defence spending ageing populations slowing growth and the need to decarbonise With inflation high it is also a bad time to let deficits growa path that might force central banks to raise rates even more For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter

 Jul 7th 2022,Are central banks in emerging markets now less of a slave to the Fed?,In america and Europe central banks turned only recently from encouraging economic recovery to battling stubborn inflation In some emerging markets this shift began much earlier Brazil central bank raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point back in March 2021 15 months before the Federal Reserve did the same It foresaw that fiscal stimulus in the rich world raised the risk of inflation which would upset financial markets and complicate life for emerging economies The governor of Russia central bank Elvira Nabiullina warned over a year ago that the prospect of sustained inflation was likelier “than perceived at first glance” The pandemic had changed spending patterns she pointed out No one knew if the shift would last But that very uncertainty was discouraging firms from investing to meet demandListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThese kinds of comments look prudent and prescient in hindsight Indeed with some notable exceptions central banks in emerging markets have won increased respect in recent years Their monetary-policy frameworks have improved according to a new index based on 225 criteria developed by the imf Their frameworks are more coherent their targets serve sensible objectives transparent they say what they are doing and consistent they do what they say According to calculations by the World Bank expectations of inflation in emerging markets in 2005-18 were about as well-anchored as they had been in rich countries in 1990-2004 Inflation also became less sensitive to falls in the exchange rate Your columnist remembers a sign outside a café in the Malaysian state of Penang in 2015 “Don’t worry!” it said “As our ringgit falls coffee price remains the same”More people expected emerging markets to succeed in their fight against inflation which in turn made success more likely This enhanced credibility raised enticing possibilities Perhaps their central banks like those in the rich world would not need to worry about each depreciation and every inflation spike If so perhaps they could pay less slavish attention to two forces that had bedevilled them in the past: namely the global price of capital which is dictated by the Fed and that of commoditiesWhen the Fed tightens monetary policy trouble has often followed for emerging markets In 2013 for example Ben Bernanke talk about reducing or tapering the pace of the Fed bond-buying sparked the “taper tantrum” a big sell-off in Brazil India Indonesia South Africa and Turkey Things are different in the rich world When the Fed tightens central banks in Britain the euro area and Japan do not feel obliged to raise interest rates Their currencies may fall But unless these depreciations look likely to raise inflation persistently above their targets they are ignored Likewise when the price of oil goes up so does the cost of living Yet consumer prices need not go on rising unless people demand higher wages in response putting further upward pressure on prices in a self-reinforcing spiral In both cases central banks can ignore a one-time increase in prices The more securely inflation expectations are anchored the more leeway central banks enjoy The past year has subjected emerging-market anchors to one severe test after another Global interest rates have risen in anticipation of a faster pace of tightening in America as the Fed wrestles with a credibility test of its own And emerging markets have suffered remorseless increases in the prices of food and fuel which make up more of their consumers’ shopping bills than they do in the rich world According to the World Bank food and energy account for over 60% of South Asia consumer-price indexSome central banks have been able to “look through” the rise in food and fuel prices One example is Thailand central bank which has done nothing even as inflation has surged It insists that “medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored” and it wants to make sure the economic recovery gains traction But other emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil felt compelled to raise interest rates forcefully long before their economies fully recovered They were quicker to respond than their counterparts in mature economies point out Lucila Bonilla and Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics But “that partly because they had to be” Much of their tightening had to keep up with a worrying rise in inflation expectations They have stayed ahead of the curve But the curve has been brutally steep The Fed has been a “somewhat less dominant” force in this emerging-market tightening cycle than in the past note Andrew Tilton and his colleagues at Goldman Sachs Fears of a second taper tantrum have not been realised One reason may be that a lot of footloose foreign capital had already left during the pandemic Moreover some of the countries that might otherwise be vulnerable to Fed tightening especially those in Latin America are also big commodity exporters that have benefited from higher prices for their wares point out Ms Bonilla and Mr Sterne Following the leader The Fed however is far from finished And inflation already rising in emerging markets may become more sensitive to any falls in domestic currencies “It like adding combustible material to a fire” says David Lubin of Citigroup a bank A depreciation may not be enough to ignite inflation But once it is already burning a weaker exchange rate could make it hotter A Malaysian café that is already revising its prices to keep up with costlier commodities may be more likely to factor in a weaker ringgit Much therefore depends on how far the Fed has to go to restore its anti-inflation credentials and contain price pressures in America The harder the Fed must work to meet the test of its own credibility the more trouble emerging markets will face Their hawkish pivot began much earlier than in America but it probably cannot end much sooner This year has reminded emerging markets that for all their progress they are not yet blessed with fully credible central banks It has taught America the same lesson For more expert analysis of the biggest

 Jul 7th 2022,Do cheaper commodities herald a recession?,The war in Ukraine throttled a flow of raw materials that was already being restricted by logistical logjams bad weather and other disruptions The result was soaring prices In March a barrel of Brent crude oil hit $128 and European gas prices were three times higher than they had been just two months earlier Copper a trendsetter for all industrial metals hit a record price of $10845 per tonne Wheat corn and soyabean prices rose by double-digit percentages The surge turbocharged consumer-price inflation which by challenging central banks’ credibility has given them another reason to raise interest rates Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet in recent weeks the wind has changed Oil is trading at around $100 a barrel Copper has dropped below $8000 a tonne for the first time in 18 months; metals in general have fallen by 10-40% since May Agricultural-commodity prices are back at pre-war levels Europe gas prices which have continued to rise as Russia has cut supply are bucking the trend The slide may fuel hopes that inflation will soon be defeated But the victory might prove hollowif there is one at all One explanation for tanking commodity prices is that worries about a recession are taking hold In this view rising interest rates are cooling the market for new homes dampening demand for building materials such as copper and wood and lowering spending on things like clothing appliances and cars which in turn hurts everything from aluminium to zinc Moreover some of the supply constraints that contributed to price rises earlier in the year have easedthe weather in grain-growing regions has improved for instance Meanwhile the un is trying to end a blockade on Ukraine shipments of wheat For central banks this is mixed news It suggests that inflation may be beaten even though they have only just begun tightening monetary policy True this might be accompanied by a recession but because inflation would be tamed without interest rates having to rise too much the downturn would perhaps at least be shallow Worries about the economy are not the only force pushing down prices Much of the money that has fled commodities say industry experts belongs not to physical traders but to financial punters In the week to July 1st about $16bn flowed out of commodity-futures markets bringing the total for the year so far to a record $145bn according to JPMorgan Chase a bank In part that reflects rising interest rates In May America long-dated real rates turned positive for the first time since 2020 That made commodities which do not offer a yield less attractive to speculators This suggests that commodity-price inflation may not have been slayed Movements driven by real-rate swings are usually short-lived says Tom Price of Liberum an investment bank The last time one happened in 2013 prices stabilised within weeks Prices are also still sensitive to further supply disruptions Commodity stocks remain 19% below historical average at a time of tight production meaning there is less of a buffer against shocks Even as some supply problems have eased triggers for others abound Energy prices are still vulnerable to Vladimir Putin whims Pricey energy in turn would cause metals producers to trim output further making production tighter still And the return of La Niña a harsh climate pattern for the third consecutive year could disrupt grain harvests worldwide Prices in other words might stay high even if recession hits For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jul 6th 2022,America rethinks its strategy for taking on China economy,China is often said to be an area of rare consensus in American politics Just about everyone agrees that something must be done to counter its rise But this appearance of unity masks divisions and even confusion about what exactly needs to be done most of all in the economic domain Is the ultimate goal to open the Chinese market to American businesses or to dissolve commercial bonds with China?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor Joe Biden administration these cross-currents have led to prolonged deliberationsso much so that some critics accuse it of paralysis A seemingly endless debate about whether to remove tariffs on China is the latest example of indecision Slowly though the shape of Mr Biden approach to the Chinese economy is emerging The coming weeks may determine whether it amounts to a resolute coherent strategy or a mess of contradictionsThe narrative is clear enough In a speech in May Antony Blinken America secretary of state boiled down Mr Biden China policy to three words: “invest align compete” That is America should invest in its own strength; align more closely with allies; and confront China where necessary Putting the spin to one side these are in fact good categories for understanding how the Biden administration is trying to deal with China economyStart with competition This took centre-stage under Donald Trump who dragged America away from a lingering desire to “engage” China towards a sharper rivalry with it By the time he left office America average tariff on Chinese products had risen from roughly 3% to nearly 20% according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics see chart 1 The immediate question for Mr Biden is what to do about this inheritanceWith inflation running high Mr Biden wants to lessen price pressures Eliminating tariffs on Chinawhich are in effect a tax on consumerswould in theory help In practice it may make a very small contribution One study from the Peterson Institute estimated that removing the tariffs would shave just 03 percentage points off the annual inflation rate which is now running at more than 8% On the one hand every little counts On the other Mr Biden is loth do something that would be portrayed by Republicans and perhaps China itself as a capitulationEven within his own administration many view the tariffs as precious leverage The most likely outcome will be minor tweaks Mr Trump earlier tariffs went after products such as semiconductors But later levies hit items like shoes hurting consumers more directly Removing tariffs on some consumer products would therefore seem like an easy decision Beyond that opposition to cuts grows steelier “For tariffs on high-tech products or industrial inputs the Biden administration may want to increase these substantially at the same time that it eliminates others It needs to determine which are working and which are not” says Clete Willems a veteran of Mr Trump trade team Hawks welcome the fact that America imports less from China than it did at the start of the trade war see chart 2 The Biden administration has also debated whether to begin a new probe into China economic behaviour Mr Trump big investigation conducted under section 301 of American trade law used to tackle problems not solvable within the wto was focused on China “forced technology transfers” Many in the Biden administration see that as a misdiagnosis The real issue is China broader state capitalism A new 301 investigation could put China industrial plans and subsidies at the forefront of America economic grievances with it Intellectually that would be appealing “The bigger challenge will be is the administration ready to do what a 301 says? Is it ready to impose significant new penalties on China?” says Scott Kennedy of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies a think-tank in Washington The White House delay in announcing a new 301 case despite talk swirling around it for months reveals its hesitancyAnother plank in America competition with China is the battery of economic sanctions rolled out against companies Mr Trump administration blazed the trail placing Chinese industrial champions from Huawei a telecoms giant to dji a dronemaker on the government “entity list” thereby preventing American companies from selling them any items without permission By the end of his term though his methods were increasingly chaotic epitomised by his ill-fated demand that the Chinese owner of TikTok a wildly popular app spin off its American operations see BriefingMr Biden team has worked to place sanctions on a sounder legal footing while also making them more targeted Most of Mr Trump corporate blacklistings are still in place Mr Biden has added to them including barring American investments in a range of Chinese surveillance-tech companies It is also considering new rules to block foreign rivals’ access to Americans’ personal data which may yet ensnare TikTok Taken together the Biden approach looks less like a retreat from Mr Trump brawl with China and more like a professionalisation of itThe second part of Mr Biden strategyalignment with alliessets him much further apart from his predecessor Whereas Mr Trump revelled in scorning America staunchest friends Mr Biden has steadfastly repaired relations The cornerstone of his approach to Asia was unveiled in May with the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ipef tying together countries that represent 40% of global gdp India Japan and Vietnam are part of it and most crucially China is not Another fruit of Mr Biden efforts was a joint statement at the end of the g7 summit on June 28th pledging to “reduce strategic dependencies” on China see China sectionThere are doubts that these fine words will add up to much concrete action The messages shared by several Asian diplomats about the ipef are remarkably similar: it is good to have America back at the table but the only dish on offer is thin gruel The ipef will include discussions about everything from decarbonisation to data sharing but there will be nothing on tariffs a mainstay of traditional trade talks The Biden administration disputes this characterisation One senior official points to the ipef focus on supply chains arguing that it will be meaty With talks starting later this month the official believes that a deal to accelerate port-clearance times could be reached within as little as a yearEven if that comes to fruition there is frustration among many in America and abroad that Mr Biden will not do more on trade A stubborn bipartisan group of politicians in Washington is still agitating for America to re-enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership a regional trade deal from which Mr Trump withdrew Allies such as Japan would love that They believe forging new supply chains is essential to lessening reliance on China For the Biden administration though the idea is a non-starter; it is fearful of alienating union supporters and angering a trade-wary public The unsatisfactory conclusion is that Mr Biden desire to align with allies in its China strategy can only go so far That speaks to the final element of Mr Biden approach: investing at home This is the area where rhetoric and action are furthest apart After all Mr Biden signature spending plan his “Build Back Better” social-and-climate package has not yet made it through Congress It is now crunch time for an initiative that was conceived as a response to China The Senate and House have passed two alternative bills with the same centrepiece: a $52bn plan for bolstering America capacity to produce semiconductors The Senate is more modest and has received bipartisan support The House‘s almost exclusively backed by Democrats contains a hotch-potch of measuresincluding even funding to save coral reefsPeople familiar with talks to bridge the differences say there has been recent progress bringing the unified bill closer to the Senate version One aspect of the House may in reduced form survive: the creation of a mechanism that for the first time would require American companies to notify the government of overseas spending raising the possibility that the White House could block some investments in China For the bill to pass before mid-term elections in November agreement will probably have to be hammered out before Congress breaks for recess for August Even without that bill the Biden administration has tried to set the tone for an investment push at home Mr Trump cajoled and threatened companies to set up factories in America making limited headway Mr Biden big initiative grabbing fewer headlines has been a sprawling review of supply chains In February the government published six separate reports covering semiconductors batteries and more This hardly equates to industrial policy on a Chinese scale But the aim is to channel financing and incentives to strengthen America manufacturing baseThe Biden plan may be pushing at an open door Since the start of his administration companies have announced more than $75bn of investments in semiconductor production and research in America That is in part a response to Mr Biden actions but also a recognition of the fragility of global supply chains Indeed perhaps the most useful policy in weaning companies off the Chinese market is Xi Jinping foolhardy pursuit of “zero covid” which has almost walled off the country If Mr Biden does succeed in boosting domestic manufacturing that victory could well come at the cost of higher prices for consumers reduced efficiency and ultimately lower economic growth True he is rebuilding frayed relationships with allies But in other respects his economic strategy for dealing with China looks a lot like a refinement of the bare-knuckle competition started by Mr Trump For coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jul 5th 2022,Crypto last man standing,Two years ago scarcely anyone in mainstream finance had heard of Sam Bankman-Fried or ftx the cryptocurrency exchange he launched in 2019 Both gained greater prominence first as the crypto craze reached fever pitch and then as crypto fell to Earth Mr Bankman-Fried widely known as sbf has lately been at the centre of attempts to rescue beleaguered crypto firms To some observers the role calls to mind the rescue missions organised by John Pierpont Morgan and America other banking scions in the early 20th century The comparison is surprisingly instructive Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe recent slump has left destruction in its wake Some crypto-lending firms notably Celsius have collapsed; some stablecoins like terra have been obliterated At least one crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has gone bust Estimates of sbf personal wealth have tumbled too from $26bn just over three months ago to nearer $8bn now Nonetheless his companies ftx and Alameda a trading firm seem to be the great survivors of the recent chaos ftx had kept employee numbers relatively low; sbf has said the exchange is still profitable Well-timed funding rounds early this year saw its global and American arms raising $400m each That has enabled sbf to help others in need In June Voyager Digital a broker secured loans worth $485m from Alameda BlockFi another trader has received a revolving line of credit from ftx American armTo some this harks back to America banking panic of 1907 The economy was in recession; towards the end of that year the thinly capitalised Knickerbocker Trust Company one of America largest financial firms at the time collapsed Morgan went on to orchestrate a series of private rescues with other financiers offering deposits in the tens of millions of dollars to various banks in order to prevent runs Those actions are usually credited with preventing a deeper more damaging crisis No other trusts went underAt first glance then the comparison is a flattering one for sbf But 1907 was not the Morgan family only attempt at a big bail-out When the Wall Street crash struck in 1929 JP Morgan junior like his father sought to bring together a gang of plutocrats to stem the tide Several bankers and brokers pledged to buy $125m in stocks equivalent to around 01% of America gdp at the time which would be about $27bn today The plan failed miserably The purchases perhaps pushed out the stockmarket collapse by a few days but did not prevent it from imploding The Dow Jones Industrial Average index of stocks fell by around 35% between early September 1929 and the end of the year By its nadir in 1932 it was almost 90% lower Historians are divided over why one intervention worked but not the other Perhaps the panic in 1929 was too far gone for private purchases to make a difference for instance Other research suggests that the success of 1907 may have been overplayed and that it was action by the Bank of France to calm domestic markets that spilled over to America and halted the mayhem The debate suggests that identifying sbf role in quelling chaos today may be just as hard The trouble could simply continue for a start Indeed on July 5th Voyager filed for bankruptcy A cynic might point out that sbf might be striking deals with other firms not because he wants to rescue the industry but because he has spotted an opportunity to snap up some of his competitors’ operations for pennies on the dollar Some of these attempts may not succeedVoyager owed Alameda $75m when it went underbut others could On July 1st Zac Prince BlockFi chief executive said that its credit line from ftx had been increased to $400m and included an option to acquire BlockFi for up to $240m That looks like a bargain compared with the valuation of $5bn that BlockFi was reportedly seeking during a fundraising round last year Even if sbf is not attempting to save crypto though history remains relevant The panic of 1907 was a proximate reason for the creation of the Federal Reserve and the beginnings of the progressive taxation of income in America as well as an expansion of antitrust law Instead of being hailed as a hero Morgan senior became the focal point for concerns that power was too concentrated in the hands of a small number of financiers Now too there is a possibility that a crash leads to more stringent oversight particularly if the volatility in digital assets spills over to other markets galvanising regulators Boosters may see a JP Morgan in Sam Bankman-Fried and ftx They might come to regret needing oneRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:What past market crashes have looked like Jun 30thHow attractively are shares now priced?

 Jul 3rd 2022,As interest rates climb and the economy cools can companies pay their debts?,Welcome to the American corporate-debt market of 2022 Often the only risky bonds that are being issued are the legacy debts of a now ancient-seeming timewhen interest rates were low and a recession was unthinkable Elsewhere the high-yield market has almost ground to a halt A paltry $83bn of risky debt has been issued so far in 2022 75% less than in the same period last year Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA sharp rise in interest rates this year has cooled credit markets wrong-footed investors and complicated bankers’ lives In January Bank of America Credit Suisse Goldman Sachs and a handful of other lenders agreed to finance a $15bn deal for two private-equity firms to buy Citrix a software firm They promised to issue the riskiest $4bn of that debt at a maximum interest rate of 9% At the time the average yield on bonds with a credit rating of ccc a speculative grade was around 8% The Citrix deal is expected to close this month But the yield on ccc-rated bonds has soared above 14% Should the bankers be unable to sell the debt below the interest-rate cap they will be on the hook for the difference “If the market is anything like it is today they are going to lose hundreds of millionsand potentially a billiondollars on this deal alone” says Roberta Goss of Pretium a debt-investment manager Such potential losses offer a glimpse of the impact that higher rates are having on company borrowing in America Bankers stand to make losses on the $80bn of buy-out financing they have agreed to facilitate for deals that are yet to close That will weigh both on their profits and their willingness to lend Companies are also going to suffer; the only question is how much A steady fall in interest rates over the past 30 years encouraged firms to borrow record amounts Now the cost of servicing and refinancing that debt is climbing profits are being dented by rising costs and inventories are piling up at some firms as demand slows Does a corporate-debt meltdown loom?America last big debt crisis in 2007-09 was in housing The stock of household debt relative to gdp had jumped as lenders aggressively issued mortgages and property prices soared When interest rates rose borrowers began to default Some 3m households were eventually foreclosed on in 2008 This time it seems far less likely that households will be the borrowers struggling Lending standards have been tightened and debt levels have fallen Household debt to gdp peaked at 99% in 2008 but has since tumbled to 75% By contrast corporate debt as a share of gdp at around 80% has been at or near record highs over the past two years see chart 1 To understand where problems might arise it is important to look across the funding options available to firms and their owners American companies owe around $122trn Some $67trn of that is in bonds mostly issued by large or mid-size public firms Another $12trn is loans from banks and $11trn is mortgage debt The restover $3trnis financing from non-banks made up mostly of either private credit typically loans made for private-equity buy-outs or “syndicated” loans which originate in banks but are split into pieces and sold to investors or sometimes bundled into other debt securities The bond market as the biggest source of debt might seem like the natural place to look for trouble But firms that issued bonds are “relative winners” of the rise in interest rates says Eric Beinstein of JPMorgan Chase a bank because most of them pay fixed coupons Of the $5trn-worth of corporate bonds issued since the start of 2020 some 87% pay fixed coupons And those rates are at all-time lows The average coupon on an investment-grade bond is just 36%half the rate in the early 2000s and still below the level in 2019 That will insulate borrowers as rates rise These fixed-rate bonds are not due to mature soon either The high-yield end of the marketthe roughly $18trn owed by sub-investment-grade issuers which tend to be smaller or heavily indebted companiessaw a wave of refinancing in 2020 and 2021 The result is that only a tiny $73bn-worth of high-yield bonds are due to mature in 2022 and 2023 The peak of risky-bond maturation will not come until 2029The impact of rising rates is likely to be much greater in the syndicated-loan and private-debt markets which typically issue floating-rate debt though some of that rate risk may have been hedged They have also seen explosive growth Between 2015 and 2021 the value of outstanding high-yield bonds rose by 15% By contrast leveraged loans a risky subset of syndicated loans grew by around 50% Private credit has more than doubled in size see chart 2 John Kline of New Mountain a private-credit firm argues that the growing market share of private credit is a reflection of the fact that it offers issuers price certainty and is “much easier to deal with” than slicing up a bank loan through a syndication process or issuing a bond He points out that the barbarian days of private-equity shops leveraging firms at debt-to-total-value ratios of 85% are long gone The average debt-to-value ratio for private-equity deals last year was closer to 50%Still that ratio is less reassuring once you consider how far private-equity valuations might have fallen this year the formal figures are revised infrequently unlike public-market valuations And with growth seems to have come fresh risk Compared with the earnings of the firms they bought debt levels look much higher: equal to an average of six times gross operating profit a little higher than the record set in 2019 or in any of the past 20 years “Whenever a market grows quickly there can be a sort of reckoning if the environment changes” says Mr Beinstein The challenge he adds is getting hold of any details or data on private deals In the bright lights of public markets it is easy enough to find evidence suggesting that companies do not face an imminent crisis The problem is that a chunk of the debt lurks in the shadows For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,The allure of betting on mergers,Big deals rarely happen without big personalities If Elon Musk were an uninteresting tycoon with a low public profile and a puritanical approach to promises then shares in Twitter a social-media platform would be trading within a whisker of his $5420 per share offer The difference or “spread” between this offer and Twitter current trading price of below $40 is a reminder that he is not Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe wider the spread the lower the chance investors assign to a deal completing To Mr Musk and Twitter management the spread is a live opinion poll in a fractious situation But to a group of specialised hedge-fund managers it is their bread and butter Merger arbitrage also known as risk arbitrage involves purchasing the shares of a target firm during the risky interval between a deal announcement and its completion The arbitrager first identifies a merger that the market is relatively gloomy aboutie a spread that they believe overestimates the chance of a deal failure Then they buy shares in the company and wait until the deal closes and the acquirer pays the offered price per share The amount of capital dedicated to this strategy has quadrupled during the past decade to more than $100bn despite some patchy returns For several reasons its star will continue to rise For a start big deals are in plentiful supply It is no coincidence that this strategy came of age during America buyout boom of the 1980s After a white-hot 2021 more than 50 deals with a value exceeding $5bn have been announced so far this year Companies’ balance-sheets are stocked with cash and tumbling valuations have created bargains The arbitragers are not yet seeing any signs of recession The deals themselves also need to have some controversy associated with them Ideally someone should be trying and failing to kill them Here lies another tailwind: that regulators are in an interventionist mood Corporate synergies are coming up against national-security and antitrust concerns Shares in Avast a Czech cyber-security firm were edging towards the price offered by NortonLifeLock its bigger American competitor before Britain Competition and Markets Authority said it was taking a closer look at the deal in March More than $1bn was wiped off the market value of a firm that was being bought for around $8bn Arbitragers were not far behind: around a quarter of Avast stock is currently in the hands of hedge funds that bought only after the deal was announced Warren Buffett a celebrated investor who became an active and successful arbitrager early in his career is returning to the action In January Microsoft announced a blockbuster takeover of Activision Blizzard a video-game developer A gaping spread cause by internal strife and competition worries was enough to tempt Berkshire Hathaway the conglomerate run by Mr Buffett to increase its stake in the game-maker to nearly 10% Mr Buffett was already a shareholder But some arbitragers have been known to screen investments by hiring translators lawyers and even courtroom spies The final bump comes from rising interest rates Spreads are widened by an increase in the risk-free rate since investors demand a higher rate of return for holding shares; those piling their capital into merger-arbitrage funds salivate at the thought of inflation-proof returns largely uncorrelated with the wider stockmarket The catch is that not every merger is completed “If the deal goes through we make some money And if the deal doesn’t go through who knows what happens” ruminated Mr Buffett recently The “who knows” part is also now more complicated The price shares would trade at following a deal collapse a crucial determinant of the risk-reward calculation for an arbitrage strategy becomes harder to assess when markets are volatile and valuations uncertain But arbitragers have at least been given a heady cocktail of dealmaking corporate complexity and rising rates For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,The case for strong and silent central banks,Late on june 13th a curious article appeared in the Wall Street Journal It said that the Federal Reserve was “likely to consider” raising interest rates by 075 percentage points at its meeting on June 15th The article was unusually silent about its sources And it proved uncannily prescient Two days later the Fed did indeed raise interest rates by that amount its biggest increase in 28 years Many investors believe the central bank had used the press to warn financial markets about what it would do in advance albeit not very far in advance That would make the Journal story an unconventional example of “forward guidance”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCentral banks often telegraph what they might do before they do it This kind of forward guidance is as old as central banking itself according to Willem Buiter a former rate-setter at the Bank of England It is certainly as old as inflation targeting The Reserve Bank of New Zealand which was the first to adopt a formal inflation target in 1990 quickly learned that it could move markets with its utterances what it called “open-mouth operations” It now publicly forecasts its own decisions If you want to know where it thinks its policy interest rate will be in the future you do not have to look out for mysteriously sourced stories in the press You can just download the central bank spreadsheetThis kind of guidance is intended as no more than a prediction based on the central bank fallible forecasts of the economy It is sometimes called “Delphic” guidance after the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece If the economy defies the forecast as it usually does the central bank may well defy its prophecy of its own behaviour In a paper published in 2012 Jeffrey Campbell then of the Chicago Fed and his co-authors distinguished Delphic forward guidance from another kind “Odyssean” Odyssean guidance is more than just a prediction It includes a promise or commitment of some kind Central bankers use it to tie their own hands like Odysseus lashing himself to the mast of his ship Why would they do that? The aim as the paper put it is to change public expectations about what central banks will do tomorrow so as to improve the economy today In a slump a central bank might not have room to cut short-term interest rates by enough to revive the economy Rates cannot easily be cut below zero It might then promise to keep rates low for longer than it otherwise would even after hearing the siren call of an economic recovery If its promise is believed expectations of inflation will rise That will magically reduce the real cost of borrowing even when the central bank policy rate can fall no further Odyssean language crept into central-bank guidance after the financial crisis of 2007-09 In April 2009 for example the Bank of Canada promised with some qualifications not to raise interest rates for 14 months In 2016 the Bank of Japan said it would keep easing until inflation had durably overshot its 2% target Similar commitments were made in the pandemic When a central bank is stuck close to the zero lower bound it can at least say what it will door refrain from doingwhen economic conditions warrant it moving again Its words speak louder than inactionBut when a central bank is not so constrained the case for Odyssean forward guidance becomes less clear If a central bank is free to act why rely on words rather than deeds? In particular why bother with forward guidance during a tightening cycle? There is after all no upper bound on interest rates That question was recently posed on Twitter by Jason Furman a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers If the central bank knows that interest rates should be higher in the future there is nothing to stop it raising them now Indeed it could increase them up to the point where it is no longer sure if the next move should be up or down In 2004 Ben Bernanke a former chairman of the Fed called this the “bang bang” approach If a central bank were to adopt it it would have little need to offer advance guidance about its future actions because everything it is committed to do it would have done already In one goOne reason why central banks nonetheless like to offer guidance is precisely because they dislike the bang-bang approach They prefer to change interest rates in small increments Forward guidance allows them to move gradually while signalling that the first small step will not be the only one But if investors heed the guidance the future steps will be priced in to longer-term interest rates straight away Thus gradual moves in the policy rate can be accompanied by big swings in broader financial conditionsIn principle a central bank could abandon gradualism while still offering non-binding forecasts of what it might do in the future But such Delphic utterances can be more trouble than they are worth Financial markets often treat them as promises not predictions “People don’t hear the caveats that well” says Mr Furman Knowing this central banks may feel unduly constrained by their past prophecies That can make it harder than necessary to adjust when their predictions inevitably go awry The Fed found itself in precisely such a predicament on June 10th when surprisingly bad consumer-price inflation figures invalidated its recent prediction that it would raise interest rates by no more than half a percentage point at a timeThe strong silent type of monetary policyMarkets react badly when they think a central bank has broken a promise That may add to volatility in itself It may also erode the central bank credibility so that when it does need to make a commitment its words are no longer believed Because promises are hard to keep a central bank should make no more than necessaryThe Fed could not adopt a closed-mouth monetary policy overnight Mr Furman points out Preparing markets for such a shift would take time But the Fed could start considering it for its next tightening cycle Even better he jokes perhaps a pioneer like the Reserve Bank of New Zealand could try it for a year first Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:People inflation expectations are risingand will be hard to bring down Jul 25thThe Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession Jun 16thA focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,What past market crashes have looked like,Looking back it is easy to think of stockmarket crashes as abrupt shocks And some of the most dramatic of them were indeed abrupt At the onset of the covid-19 pandemic the s&p 500 index of American stocks plummeted by 34% in a little over a month The last time Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998 the index took six weeks to travel from zenith to nadir nearly taking Long-Term Capital Management and the rest of Wall Street with it Quickest of all was the lightning bolt of October 19th 1987 or “Black Monday” which wiped 20% off the market in a single dayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe biggest downturns though have tended to be much more drawn-out affairs The bloodbath in equities that accompanied the financial crisis of 2007-09 was no single vertiginous plunge: it played out over 17 months Talk of the dotcom bubble “bursting” in the early 2000s can obscure the fact that the journey from peak to trough took two and a half years The greatest crash of all beginning in 1929 took nearly three years to run its courseIn each case losing streaks were interspersed by rallies lasting weeks and fitful days when not much of anything happened If not quite months of boredom punctuated by moments of terror they were long uncertain slogs Today six months after America equity market started falling in the face of persistent inflation and tighter monetary policy another slog might lie ahead But when the bottom finally arrives what will it look like?Like a bubble capitulationinvestors’ jargon for the final frenzied phase of a routis accompanied by a kind of mania It is the part of the crash when something snaps in the collective consciousness and everyone who is going to give up and sell does Perhaps they are retail investors who kept their nerve after losing a third of their capital but seeing another 20% of value vanish conclude that it really might go to zero and rush to the exit Perhaps they are professionals who know full well it a bad time to sell but can’t get their risk manager or their clients off their back Either way it is the violence of the shake-out itself that creates the market bottom: those who refuse to sell at the height of the panic are unlikely to lose their cool further down the line After the frenzy is over prices start to climb againSo much for recognising capitulation in hindsight Spotting it as it happens is harder Perhaps some clues can be gleaned from how historical crashes have played out Start with the crudest measures: the length of the crash and the size of the drop from peak to trough Excluding this year the s&p 500 has notched up 14 bear marketsfalls of more than 20% compared with a recent peaksince the second world war The average downturn took a little over 11 months and resulted in a decline of more than 32% Both measures suggest that this year losses which hit 23% in June before rebounding a little may have some way yet to run For a more granular picture consider the rout in March 2020 One lesson from it is that trading volumes spike as the market plummets Towards the end of the crash shares in the s&p 500 were changing hands at more than double their average rate in the weeks running up to it Volumes for stocks in Britain ftse 100 tripled Another signal is that a large proportion of stocks in an index plunge in value While the downturn in 2020 was at first led by a handful of stocks by the last phase pretty much everything was flashing red True capitulation is reached when contagion spreads not just from one stock to another but across indices and asset classes Set against those measures this year bear market is yet to reach its culmination Investors are gloomy but not so much that they have sold their favourite risky assets Downward lurches have begun to include defensive stocks but many of those in sectors including pharmaceuticals and telecoms are still up on the year And the drops do not yet smack of panic: the s&p 500 worst day this year was its 39th-worst since the turn of the century Trading volumes for the most part suggest a market that is just about holding its nerveIf capitulation is tricky to pinpoint as it arrives profiting from it is harder still How many prices need to be plummeting in lockstep before it becomes time to buy?

 Jun 30th 2022,The latest desperate attempt to prop up the Turkish lira,In turkey the abnormal is the new normal If official figures are to be believed annual inflation now exceeds 73% If Turkish consumers are to be believed it is much higher Measured against the dollar the lira resembles a black-diamond ski slope The currency has lost a fifth of its value against the greenback since the start of the year The obvious solution would be a dramatic increase in interest rates But the country president Recep Tayyip Erdogan refuses to allow the central bank to tighten monetary policyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe shock value of the zany economic theory Turkey leader has peddled for some time namely that the solution to high inflation is low interest rates has worn off What has investors and Turkish companies spooked now are the lengths to which Mr Erdogan may go to keep the current monetary settings in place The spectre of capital controls has begun to loom over the country On June 23rd the central bank decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the sixth month in a row That much was expected The surprise came the next day courtesy of Turkey banking authority known as the bddk Turkish companies it ruled would no longer be eligible for loans in lira if their foreign-currency holdings exceeded 15m lira roughly $900000 and if the amount exceeded a tenth of their assets or yearly salesBy forcing companies to sell dollars and euros the government hopes to breathe some life into the lira Turkish exporters already have to convert 40% of their foreign revenues according to an earlier decision made by regulators But the move may also hamstring companies and trigger capital outflows The more the government penalises foreign-currency holdings the less able firms are to protect their savings against inflation undermining confidence They will also find it harder to buy goods and services from abroad Some will look for ways to circumvent the new directive says Durmus Yilmaz a former governor of the central bank and will park more money abroadTurkey increasingly unorthodox attempts to support the lira have already taken a heavy toll on the economy and the public finances Since 2019 the central bank has burned through at least $165bn in foreign reserves by intervening in currency markets Late last year the government unveiled a scheme to compensate holders of special lira deposits for the currency depreciation against the dollar in an attempt to stop a further lurch Turks have since poured 963bn lira into the special accounts Because the currency has nonetheless continued to slide the treasury owes them billions of dollars The government latest move does not meet the textbook definition of capital controls measures to stem the flow of foreign capital into and out of the country But it suggests more severe interventions might be in store if the lira continues to plummet Analysts say Mr Erdogan would much sooner impose capital controls than allow rate increases “I’m 100% sure he will not use interest rates as a tool” says Ozlem Derici Sengul of Spinn a consultancy in Istanbul The country is sliding down a slippery slope For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,Inflation in America soars to 8% Or is it more like 6%?,The federal reserve “preferred measure of inflation” is a phrase that often crops up in reporting on the American economy It stands in for a verbose official name: the personal-consumption-expenditures price index pcepi Most discussion of inflation however focuses on its better-known and pithier relative the consumer-price index cpiListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat usually does not matter much But the gap between cpi and pcepi has recently widened hitting 23 percentage points in May the largest divergence since 1981 So while headlines blare out that cpi inflation is running at more than 8% annually it is just over 6% in the pcepi world To be sure the lower pcepi figure is not cause for celebration Just like cpi it is also at a four-decade high But it is nonetheless instructive to consider why the gap has grown so wide The simple explanation is weighting Housing for instance is 33% of cpi but just 16% of pcepi Petrol also has a slightly higher share in cpi The pcepi gauge is broader encompassing things purchased on behalf of consumers such as medical care even if paid for by the government or an employer When rents and oil prices soar cpi inflation tends to outstrip pcepi inflation The Fed prefers pcepi because it reflects how money is actually spent If people stop buying expensive cars and spend more on bus tickets that shift shows up in pcepi; cpi by contrast just registers the higher car prices “cpi doesn’t allow for immediate substitution which exacerbates the divergence” says Julie Smith of Lafayette College In theory that might tempt the Fed to highlight pcepi now The latest figures out on June 30th showed that core pcepi excluding food and energy rose by 03% in May compared with April slower than the 06% jump in cpi But Jerome Powell the Fed chairman instead highlighted cpi when explaining the central bank jumbo interest-rate rise on June 15th Partly that is because cpi was published just before its decision The fact that cpi is more widely discussed even if less accurate also recommends it The central bank concern is that inflation expectations are becoming unmoored If people pay more attention to cpi the Fed will feel obliged to do so too For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 30th 2022,Can Europe keep the lights on this winter?,Europe energy war is becoming total Having already banned or promised to ban imports of Russian oil leaders of the g7 group of countries said on June 28th that they would explore ways to cap its price as well as that of Russian gas Populations are being prepared for pain Britain has hinted that it will reform its power market to curb the influence of natural gas on domestic prices French utilities have called on consumers to cut energy use “immediately” One goal of such manoeuvres is to deprive Russia of much-needed revenue Another is to try to ward off the energy crunch that looms over Europe Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOnly a month ago it looked like a crisis might be avoidedjust As America cranked up its exports of liquefied natural gas lng its share of Europe total gas imports rose from 6% in September to 15% in May even as Russia slumped from 40% to 24% What gas Europe needed from its troublesome neighbour still flowed Russia did turn off the taps to Bulgaria Finland and Poland after they refused to pay in roubles as it had demanded but they bought little in the first place The continent reserves were building up at a record paceThen two things happened On June 8th a fire shut down the Freeport gas-liquefaction facility in Texas The outage which is expected to last 90 days has deprived Europe of 25% of its gas supply A week later Gazprom a Russian energy giant said that supply to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would fall to just 40% of capacity ostensibly because of the delayed return of a turbine being serviced in Canada Gazprom blames sanctions That took another 75% off Europe supply There are few other sources lng terminals are running at full tilt Little more can flow through pipelines from Algeria Azerbaijan or Norway Restarting the Dutch gas field of Groningen which once supplied as much as Nord Stream but was phased out after causing earthquakes is politically tricky The result reckons Rystad Energy a consultancy is that the eu gas-storage facilities will be two-thirds full by the end of October short of the bloc target of four-fifths There is even a fear that Nord Stream which is due for regular servicing in July will not restart once the maintenance ends If so Europe may enter the winter with storage levels at just 60% That raises questions about the continent ability to stay warm this winter Moreover gas-fired power generation has become the marginal source of electricity supply over the past year in western Europe implying that its cost is what sets power prices across the region Last year this was partly because renewable-power generation was hampered by droughts and thus feeble rivers and insufficiently strong winds This time the problem is that nuclear reactors in France require maintenance and are running at less than half their capacity That is draining Europe power supplyjust as a heatwave in the south is boosting demand for cooling France spot power prices averaged €197 $206 per megawatt-hour in May compared with €15 a year ago One way Europe copes with imbalances is through trade France once the region largest exporter of power is now buying electricity from its neighbours Wholesale gas is now dearer in Germany and eastern Europe because of the reduction of supply through Nord Stream see chart That will incentivise flows from Britain and Spain which have lng terminals But it will not increase the aggregate supply of fuel and power And there are signs that in a crunch unity could fray On June 29th it emerged that one of Britain first steps in an emergency would be to cut off gas to mainland Europe eu countries are thus scrambling to find alternatives to gas Germany has reversed plans to retire more than one-fifth of its coal-fired power stations this year Austria Britain France and the Netherlands have said they may either delay closures of or reopen coal plants Some of the seven European nuclear plants that are due to be shut by the end of winter may also be kept operating a bit longer Yet even if all of this is done gas will probably continue to set electricity prices A futures contract for Germany “baseload” ie non-renewable power in December currently trades at 25% above gas-fired power-generation costs suggesting that the market is pricing in a gas crunch plus a premium A persistent supply shortfall means demand will have to adjust High prices might do part of the job But rationing may also have to be imposed on gas- and power-hungry companies such as producers of fertiliser glass and steel How drastic those curbs are and whether they end up being extended to households will in turn depend on two wild cards: winter temperatures on the continent;

 Jun 29th 2022,The battle between Asia financial centres is heating up,“Another one!” was how a Singaporean manager of serviced apartments greeted your correspondent fresh off the plane from Hong Kong The response tells you which of the two cities is currently enjoying an influx of people and business The latest impetus has been their contrasting approaches to the pandemic Singapore began opening up to the rest of the world last year; by comparison although the quarantine periods for arrivals to China and Hong Kong have been shortened there is no sign yet of their end Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHong Kong is widely seen as the third-most-important city for global finance and business after New York and London and ahead of Shanghai and Singapore Most historians trace its rise as a financial centre to the early 1970s when it became a hub for Asian offshore financing Its importance then increased dramatically after China began to open up under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 Hong Kong was where Western bankers could mingle with Chinese businessmen while private-sector activity in the mainland was still finding its feet The deals they made were governed by the territory reliable regulatory framework and courts that made use of English law Yet even before the pandemic the established order of Asia global hubs was being thrown into doubt Over the quarter-century since Hong Kong was returned to Chinese sovereignty the mainland has tightened its grip on the territory institutions Under its influence Hong Kong has introduced a sinister national-security law; the city independent judiciary long valued by foreign investors has been weakened by political intervention That has tarnished its appeal relative to Singapore another entrepot with a common-law legal system business-friendly regulation and low taxes Moreover South-East Asia has become an increasingly desirable place for Western companies to do business which by virtue of proximity further burnishes Singapore allure For firms intending to operate in China meanwhile the benefits of setting up in Hong Kong rather than Shanghai are diminishing How will the roles of these cities evolve in the face of such forces? To answer the question consider three measures of the importance of a city for global business and finance: its use as a base for conducting regional or global business; its position as a centre for wealth made elsewhere to be managed and invested; and the size of its capital market and the banking activities associated with itStart with where business is Hong Kong status as a regional base for global firms was always tied to China but that relationship has become more intimate still in recent years The number of Chinese firms with regional headquarters in the territory has doubled since 2015 even as the number of American firms using the city as a base for their Asian or greater China operations has steadily declined see chartSingapore does not produce similar statistics but a flurry of recent openings by big firms is illustrative Sony Music an American entertainment company; Dyson a British home-appliance maker; and VinFast a Vietnamese maker of electric vehicles have all set up regional or global headquarters there in recent years Chinese tech firms including Alibaba TikTok and Tencent have done so too led by their need to be outside China “great firewall” in order to run their global operationsSingapore has publicly been ambivalent about stealing business from Hong Kong Lee Hsien Loong the city-state prime minister has welcomed expats but said that he would be just as happy if they felt able to remain in Hong Kong contributing to the region dynamism In the background however the approach is less magnanimous The city sharp-elbowed investment-promotion agency works to help would-be migrants with visas and business registrations Shanghai had attracted Western outposts before the pandemic Some firms such as Coca-Cola had moved their Asia headquarters there from Hong Kong Regulatory changes in 2020 allowed foreign investment banks to run majority-controlled businesses in China Several have consequently expanded their operations in Beijing and Shanghai Foreign asset managers including Amundi and BlackRock have also scaled up their onshore presence The city grim lockdowns may have cooled that ardour in the near term In a recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai only one American firm out of 133 planned to increase its investment in China Yet for firms intending to have some exposure to the mainland Shanghai may ultimately prove unavoidable The more Hong Kong comes under China thumb the less unattractive being based on the mainland becomes China may be more draconian in its approach both to governance and covid-19 but it is at least home to vast numbers of suppliers and customers “If you want to be in China it will be increasingly important to be onshore and close to your clients and companies” says Christian Brun of Wellesley an executive-recruitment firm for the financial-services industry Mr Brun predicts job growth on the mainland and in Singapore with fewer roles for expats in particular in Hong Kong He himself has moved from Hong Kong to SingaporeA second gauge of the cities’ relative dominance is wealth management It is here that the competition between Hong Kong and Singapore has been fiercest By one measure Hong Kong pot of assets under management and fund advisory rose from nearly $13trn in 2010 to more than $3trn in 2020 But a comparable measure for Singapore shot up from around $1trn to $34trn with the city overtaking Hong Kong as long ago as 2017 Its simple laws for establishing trusts and its tax efficiency have attracted wealth to it A new form of investment vehicle launched in 2020 the variable-capital company has also proved popular with fund managers Hong Kong has been squeezed in other areas of investment management too Of the 20 largest managers of venture-capital funds globally measured by capital raised in the past decade seven were in Beijing Shanghai or Shenzhen Venture capitalists hoping to cash in on South-East Asia boom have chosen Singapore as a base The city closer links with Indian firms are also an attractionWhen it comes to capital markets and investment banking our third gauge of the cities’ importance though Hong Kong retains its crown With China government showing no sign of allowing capital to flow freely in and out of the mainland soon the territory value as a gateway remains It hosts the Connect programmes that allow foreign investors to trade onshore bonds and equities and Chinese punters to trade stocks in the territory Three-quarters of all transactions in yuan made through the swift interbank-messaging system are booked in Hong Kong The territory has been a hub for Chinese firms to list in recent years including Alibaba and jdcom in 2019 and 2020 though few have come this year Overall the value of the city listed stocks runs to nearly $5trn compared with $7trn in Shanghai and $700bn in Singapore That in turn has helped Hong Kong sustain an edge in global banking even though some desks have moved to Singapore to skirt the territory quarantine rules Hong Kong then will remain a route to investing in China But it may be less likely to attract other sorts of new business The companies that do move there are more likely to be Chinese To others Hong Kong delay in reopening seems to typify its indifferent approach to its global status Faced with it firms seeking to do business in Asia more broadly may choose Singapore And those wanting to do business in China may expand their presence onshore instead Where Hong Kong alone used to suffice some firms may start to see a Shanghai-and-Singapore strategywhich uses the first for operations in China and the second for those in the rest of Asiaas an attractive long-term bet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 26th 2022,Why inflation looks likely to stay above the pre-pandemic norm,The bad news on inflation just keeps coming At more than 9% year on year across the rich world it has not been this high since the 1980sand there have never been so many “inflation surprises” where the data have come in higher than economists’ forecasts see chart This in turn is taking a heavy toll on the economy and financial markets Central banks are raising interest rates and ending bond-buying schemes crushing equities Consumer confidence in many places is now even lower than it was in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic “Real-time” indicators of everything from housing activity to manufacturing output suggest that economic growth is slowing sharplyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhat consumer prices do next is therefore one of the most important questions for the global economy Many forecasters expect that annual inflation will soon ebb in part because of last year sharp increases in commodity prices falling out of the year-on-year comparison In its latest economic projections the Federal Reserve for instance expects annual inflation in America as measured by the personal-consumption-expenditures index to fall from 52% at the end of this year to 26% by the end of 2023You might be forgiven for not taking these prognostications too seriously After all most economists failed to see the inflationary surge coming and then wrongly predicted it would quickly fade In a paper published in May Jeremy Rudd of the Fed made a provocative point: “Our understanding of how the economy worksas well as our ability to predict the effects of shocks and policy actionsis in my view no better today than it was in the 1960s” The future path of inflation is to a great extent shrouded in uncertainty Indeed some indicators point to more price pressure to come in the near term Alternative Macro Signals a consultancy runs millions of news articles in several languages through a model to construct a “news inflation pressure index” The results which are more timely than the official inflation figures measure not just how frequently price pressures are mentioned but also whether the news flow suggests they are building up In both America and the euro area the index is still well above 50 indicating that pressures are continuing to accumulate Inflation worrywarts can point to three other indicators suggesting that the rich world is unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic norm of low stable price growth any time soon: rising wage growth and increases in the inflation expectations of both consumers and companies If sustained these could together contribute to what the Bank for International Settlements the central bank for central banks described in a report published on June 26th as a “tipping point” Beyond it warned the bis “an inflationary psychology” could spread and become “entrenched” Evidence is mounting that workers are starting to bargain for higher wages This could create another round of price increases as firms pass on the extra costs A survey by the Bank of Spain suggests that half of collective-bargaining deals signed for 2023 contain “indexation clauses” meaning that salaries are automatically tied to inflation up from a fifth before the pandemic In Germany ig Metall a trade union has asked for a 7-8% pay rise for nearly 4m workers in the metals and engineering sector it will probably get about half that In Britain rail workers went on strike as they sought a rise of 7% though it is unclear whether they will succeed All this will make wage growth hotter still Already a tracker for the g10 group of countries compiled by Goldman Sachs a bank is rising almost vertically A measure of pay pressure from Alternative Macro Signals is similarly animated And wage floors are rising too The Netherlands is bringing forward an uplift to the minimum wage; earlier this month Germany passed a bill increasing its minimum by one-fifth Australia industrial-relations agency has raised the wage floor by 52% more than double last year increase Faster wage growth in part reflects the public higher expectations for future price risesthe second reason to worry that inflation might prove sticky In America near-term expectations are rising fast The average Canadian says they are braced for inflation of 7% over the next year the highest figure of any rich country Even in Japan the land where prices only rarely change beliefs are shifting A year ago a survey by the central bank found that just 8% of people believed that prices would go up “significantly” over the next year consumer prices indeed rose by only 25% in the year to April Now however 20% of people reckon that will happen The third factor relates to companies’ expectations Retailers’ inflation expectations are at an all-time high in a third of eu countries A survey by the Bank of England suggests that clothes prices for Britain autumn and winter collections will be 7-10% higher than a year ago The Dallas Fed does find tentative evidence that customers are less willing to tolerate price increases than before; a respondent in the rental and leasing business complained that “it is getting tougher to pass on the 20-30% price increases we have received from manufacturers” But that merely points to a lower level of high inflation The big hope for lower inflation relates to the price of goods Fast increases in the prices of cars fridges and the like linked in part to supply-chain snarls drove the initial inflationary surge last year Now there is some evidence of a reversal The cost of shipping something from Shanghai to Los Angeles has fallen by a quarter since early March In recent months many retailers spent big on inventories in order to keep their shelves full Many are now cutting prices to shift stock In America car production is at last picking up which could unwind some of the outrageous price increases for used vehicles seen last year Falling goods prices could in theory help douse the inflationary flames in the rich world easing the cost-of-living crisis giving central banks breathing room and buoying financial markets But with enough indicators of future prices pointing the other way the odds of that happening have lengthened Don’t be surprised if inflation roars for a while yet For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,The rights and wrongs of investing in natural gas,Can natural gas ever be a “green” investment? Burning any fossil fuel inevitably makes the planet warmer Yet switching power stations to gas from more carbon-intensive coal has helped countries cut their total emissions in the past Environmentalists counter that global temperatures have risen so much that all fossil-fuel use needs to be ended as quickly as possible if the world is to meet the targets laid out in the Paris agreement to limit global warming to “well below 2°c”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEuropean institutions cannot agree on the question among themselves The European Commission proposal for a “green taxonomy” a classification scheme that aims to guide sustainability-minded investors says the fuel can count as green provided it acts as a “bridge” to more renewable sources The European Investment Bank eib the eu state-backed lender by contrast has virtually ruled out investing in natural gas as inconsistent with its climate commitments The eib is not alone Multilateral development banks mdbs that channel money from rich countries towards worthy projects such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have in general turned away from financing natural gas In 2018 they signed a joint statement saying they would align their lending with the Paris goals giving them limited scope to invest in the fuel Few mdbs lent as much to gas projects as the eib did before it said in 2019 that it would start phasing out such investment Researchers at Boston University calculate that the eib provided more than half of the $637bn invested by mdbs in natural gas between 2008 and 2021 mostly for transmission and storage That is a tiny fraction of the total amount invested in energy worldwide but mdbs argue they help catalyse private investmentThe return of coal provides the case for restarting spending on gas Eager to move away from imported gas from Russia on June 19th the German government announced it was restarting some previously mothballed coal power plants Investing more in Europe gas infrastructuresuch as pipelines terminals for liquefied natural gas lng imports and storage facilitiescould alleviate a shortage of natural gas and keep the continent from having to switch on such plants At present bottlenecks prevent lng imports moving from the continent terminals which are mostly in the west to the eastern and central European countries that need to swiftly wean themselves off piped Russian gasWhat does the tension between the commission vision of “green” and the eib thinking mean for increasing investment in gas? Some think the implications are limited If there is indeed a business case for gas in Europe then the private sector could simply finance it says Sonia Dunlop of e3g a think-tank Scarce public money should be used elsewhereBut the disagreement over the question of investing in gas hints at a deeper problem Whether it is deemed green or not gas is an increasingly unattractive investment the high prices for the fuel after Russia invasion of Ukraine notwithstanding Both private and mdb investors worry that gas infrastructure could end up “stranded” as regulatory changes or technological improvements render them unprofitable mdbs that lend to poor countries are worried that such investments might leave taxpayers saddled with debts for worthless assets Even the commission taxonomy classes the fuel as “green” only until 2030 And as long as everyone agrees that gas is dirty in the long term there is little incentive to invest today For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub

consumer prices rose by 25% in the year to April compared with 83% in America Excluding fresh food and energy Japanese prices are still up by less than 1% year-on-year and wages by less than 2% There is little sign of domestically generated price growthThe weak yen meanwhile has a mixed effect It drives up imported inflation and magnifies the effect of rising dollar-denominated oil prices But after many years in which Japan price level has barely budged a shallow increase does not seem an urgent threat Even with all these external shocks inflation is barely above the central bank target of 2% Rapid moves in the currency make planning difficult for businesses but a weaker exchange rate benefits many exporters of manufactured goods as well as the holders of Japan ¥12 quadrillion in overseas assets which have gone up in yen termsNor does the mood within the boj so far hint at a coming change in policy The central bank still has several monetary doves in its roosts Kataoka Goushi was the sole board member to vote against holding policy unchanged in June but because he wanted even more stimulus not less In early June Wakatabe Masazumi the bank deputy governor said that monetary easing should be pursued to maintain wage growth And Kuroda Haruhiko the governor of the boj is a longtime advocate of monetary stimulus to revive Japan sluggish economic growthMr Kuroda is now into the final year of his term His replacement may well be Amamiya Masayoshi another deputy governor who is so entrenched in the institution that he is known as “Mr boj” Mr Amamiya has sometimes been seen as more hawkish than Mr Kuroda But in his most recent comments on monetary policy in mid-May he spoke in favour of continuing current policy without reservations Barring a change to the domestic picture or a groundswell of hawkish sentiment within the boj investors expecting a u-turn are likely to be disappointed For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,How inflation and interest rates might affect Italy budget,Before the pandemic it was a cause for excitement among economists that the real interest rate governments paid on their debts had fallen below the rate of economic growth in most rich countries allowing governments to spend more freely and worry less about running up debts But central banks’ battle with inflation today threatens to turn that relationship on its head making the fiscal position of indebted governments more perilousListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen interest rates are below growth rates governments can run primary budget deficits that is deficits before interest payments are taken into account without the debt-to-gdp ratio necessarily rising But when rates exceed economic growth primary surpluses are the only way to keep indebtedness stable The higher the starting debt the more belt-tightening neededFortunately inflation reduces the real interest rate and so most countries will gain a fiscal windfall this year Some of their debt in other words will be inflated away But if central banks successfully bring inflation down and if high interest rates endure things could get more painful The picture looks especially worrying in Italy The euro zone third-largest economy had net public debt worth nearly 140% of gdp last year Its government currently pays about 35% to borrow for ten yearsPrecisely where Italy indebtedness and borrowing costs will settle after the energy crisis is uncertain Our table shows a range of combinations for debt and financing costs and what they would imply for the country budget were growth to match the average imf forecast during 2022-27 and were inflation to fall to the European Central Bank target of 2% In reality the average tenor of outstanding Italian debt is nearly eight years so it would take time for its average financing cost to rise to the levels shown on the right-hand side of the tableAt financing costs of 3% or below Italy can run small primary deficits and still outgrow its debt The table also shows one weird effect of growth exceeding interest rates: that debt stability is easier to achieve when starting debts are higher As interest rates rise however stability requires primary surpluses of 2% or more The only time Italy has run so tight a budget since the global financial crisis was in 2012 at the height of European austerityFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Jun 23rd 2022,Is the euro zone doom loop still to be feared?,Those old enough to remember the euro zone economic crisis of a decade ago may have felt a shiver of déjà vu on June 15th when the European Central Bank ecb called an emergency meeting to discuss the widening spreads between member countries’ government-bond yields It is nearly exactly a decade ago that as yields soared Mario Draghi then the president of the ecb promised to do whatever it took to preserve the single currency Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn both instances bond spreads began to narrow after the central bank intervened Today the ecb is considering an “anti-fragmentation” tool to lower spreads say by buying the bonds of weaker countries provided they meet certain conditions Nonetheless worries that the currency union might start to look shaky remain in the air The fiscal position of Italy in particular which last year had net public debt in the region of 140% of gdp is preoccupying investors Should interest rates rise much more financial markets might start to doubt its ability to pay its debts One dangerous feature of the previous crisis was the infamous “doom loop” that connected banks and sovereigns Crudely put euro-area banks were loaded up with home sovereign debt When fears of sovereign default intensified banks’ balance-sheets crumbled which then required them to be propped up by an already wobbly state As banks cut lending the real economy weakened further worsening the public finances How much of a worry is this doom loop today? A consideration of the various links in the chain suggests it is less fearsomebut that the monster has not been slain Start with banks’ exposure to their home sovereigns After the global financial crisis in 2007-09 banks in southern European countries started to buy large amounts of bonds issued by their home government which banking regulators consider to be risk-free meaning that banks do not need to fund their holdings of them with capital Spanish lenders increased their holdings of national government bonds from around 2% of total assets in 2009 to more than 9% by 2015; Italian banks increased their holdings of home sovereign debt from 4% to nearly 11% over the same period Banks in most big euro-area countries have since reduced their exposures to their home sovereign Strikingly the boss of one of the bloc big lenders says that it no longer has any exposure to any euro-area sovereign debt But Italian banks are the big exception They remain just as exposed to their government debt as they were a decade ago In Italy at least this part of the doom loop is alive and kicking What about governments’ exposure to collapsing banks? Severing this bit of the feedback loop has certainly been an important aim of policymakers The eu banking unionwhich sought to set up a system of common supervision resolution and deposit insurancewas born nearly a decade ago The idea was to make banks more European and rescuing them less of a national affair The problem however is that the task is only half done The ecb has been in charge of supervising banks since 2014 That together with regulatory changes that have forced banks to fund lending with more capital have made it more likely that troubled lenders can be restructured meaning that sovereigns are less exposed to the risks stemming from collapsing banks than they used to be But the European resolution of banks remains incomplete and common deposit insurance has not been set up at all All told “the safety-net for banks and deposits remains predominantly national and the exposure of banks to sovereigns has not been solved” concludes Nicolas Veron of Bruegel a think-tank in Brussels If governments’ sensitivity to failing banks is somewhat lower than it used to be what about the economy exposure to zombie lenders? Europe remains largely bank-based with capital markets playing a minor role in financing firms It helps at least that banks are less stuffed with non-performing loans than they used to be and are in better shape overall But a hit to a national banking system could still impair its ability to lend to firms and households unless they find other sources of finance In 2015 the European Commission launched a plan to bolster Europe capital markets But little progress has been made Most indicators that measure the size of capital markets and the degree to which they are integrated have moved sideways The main problem say observers is that national politicians have not fully committed themselves to the difficult work of harmonising rules across countries Regulation aside there have been two big improvements within the euro zone that will help weaken the doom loop The first is on fiscal policy Without transfers between member states a national economy will always suffer when its government is forced to cut spending A sovereign under financial stress may have to cut benefits or raise taxes precisely when the economy is weak That in turn lowers tax revenues worsening the fiscal position From the start of the euro area crisis in 2010 until about 2014 countries painfully shrank their deficits hurting economic growth It was only when interest rates came down and austerity was eased that the economy began to recover The covid-19 pandemic has led to more fiscal integration The eu recovery fund financed by commonly issued debt will spend about €750bn $790bn over the next five years with more money going to support investment in the weakest economies Such a mechanism of fiscal transfers if repeated could make the sovereign-to-economy loop less severe in the future The second big improvement is political Few politicians are agitating for their countries to leave the euro which in turn means investors are not getting jittery about euro exit and debt defaultAbout a decade ago policymakers in the euro zone started off with bold plans to eliminate the doom loop Some of those have come to fruition But the overall picture is mixed With a recession looming and interest rates rising that might not be good enough For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 23rd 2022,Can the Fed pull off a controlled slowdown of the housing market?,Estate agents are known for their sunny disposition Lindsay Garcia a realtor in Miami is no exception She talks about the city warm climate and low taxes both of which have lured a wave of footloose outsiders For much of the past two years agents enjoyed a bonanza Buyers fought to outbid each other waived property inspections and bought units sight unseen; many paid well over the asking price Then mortgage rates began to climb this year cooling the frenzy a little Only houses that were newly renovated or ready to be moved into straight away received multiple offers Ms Garcia says Now a fresh spike in mortgage rates seems to have slammed the brakes on altogetherListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn June 15th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 075 percentage points Figures released a day later revealed that the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate had hit 578% an increase of more than half a percentage point over the week before By June 17th two of Ms Garcia colleagues had been rung up by buyers abruptly calling off deals because they could no longer afford themThe plight of the would-be buyers illustrates just how swift and brutal the rise in interest rates has been and how immediate its impact is on interest-sensitive sectors such as housing In January mortgage rates were around 3% only a little above their all-time low of 267% reached during the pandemic They have nearly doubled since see chart; only in the 1980s was there a comparably rapid rise in interest rates The increase has made houses even more unaffordable In January a buyer with a deposit of $100000 looking to spend $3000 a month on housing could afford a home worth $815000 Now they can afford one worth just $600000 The prospect of a turn in the property market fortunes naturally calls to mind America housing crisis of 2007-09 But there are important differences between the two situations Rising interest rates in the late 2000s revealed just how imprudent mortgage lending had been By contrast the median fico scorea measure of creditworthinessfor mortgages today is about 48 points higher than the pre-financial-crisis level of around 700 Household balance-sheets are robust bolstered by pandemic stimulus and in aggregate there has been far less borrowing for house purchases than in the early 2000s The total value of mortgage debt is around 65% of household income compared with nearly 100% in 2007Though it is possible that pockets of dodgy debt lurk in the shadows today it seems less probable that rising rates will uncover systemic weaknesses in lending standards that could set off a vicious cycle of falling prices and foreclosures Instead the problem of 2022 is house-price growth itself “The type of acceleration in house prices that we’ve seen over the past two years is unprecedented” says Enrique Martínez-García of the Dallas Fed By the first quarter of the year the increase in American house prices over the previous two years at 37% was the fastest on record That rapid growth is a problem for the Fed argues Mr Martínez-García because it feeds into rents which in turn contribute to headline inflation According to Redfin a property platform asking rents in May were 15% higher than in the same month last year As new leases are signed these will eventually add to consumer-price inflation Indeed rising housing costs already accounted for 40% of the monthly increase in the consumer-price index in May “Cooling the housing market is almost a precondition to being able to tame inflation” says Mr Martínez-García A housing slowdown then will this time be engineered rather than uncovered The best possible outcome is that the Fed manages to slow the property market by enough to bring inflation under control without overdoing it The events of the early 1980s when interest rates last climbed so quickly illustrate what such a controlled slowdown might look like Inflation soared to well above 10% Paul Volcker had just been appointed chairman of the Fed and the federal funds rate was briefly raised to an all-time high of about 20% Property prices did fall sharplybut only in real terms From 1979 to 1982 real house prices fell by nearly a fifth even as prices in nominal terms rose by a tenth More notably housing transactions fell off a cliff Existing-home sales peaked at 4m in 1978; four years later only 2m homes were sold Higher interest rates this time are indeed likely to hit transaction volumes first That the initial consequence will be a fall in property sales rather than a rise in financial distress among homeowners can be partly explained by a quirk in the America mortgage market In most countries borrowers are offered fixed interest rates for only two to five years; when that period ends the rate floats in line with the central bank policy rate But the existence of America government-sponsored housing agencies most notably Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were set up to incentivise home ownership means that the vast majority of American mortgages are on a 30-year fixed rate That makes would-be sellers increasingly reluctant to move and give up their cheap mortgages when rates go up Buyers meanwhile can no longer afford the kind of house they want Daryl Fairweather of Redfin therefore expects the market to go into a “cold period” of scant activity for the rest of the year Things could easily get more complicated than they did in the 1980s though if the Fed is unable to act with enough precision to stabilise the market without causing prices to crash The fact that housing has been so frothy makes the task harder What has been remarkable about the past couple of years of price growth is that it has been so difficult to square with any of the “usual explanations” such as millennial household formation or supply constraints says Mr Martínez-García Once those explanations have been ruled out all that is left is “expectations” such as the fear of missing out on ever being able to buy a house Cooling a hot property market by just enough to quell inflation is one thing Deflating a bubble without popping it is another For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 21st 2022,How attractively are shares now priced?,Everyone knows or thinks they know the advice of Warren Buffett to investors: that “they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful” After share prices in America plunged firmly into bear-market territory defined as a fall of 20%-plus from a recent peak in June some will be starting to wonder whether there is enough fear in the air to warrant their being greedy Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHow attractively are shares now priced? One approach is to use the equity risk premium as a guide A rough-and-ready version of it suggests that it is not obviously a time for would-be Buffetts to swoop in Equities are not yet priced at fearful levels An opportunity for greed may yet arise But the circumstances will be such that only the steeliest of investors can take advantageStart with some definitions Stocks are riskier than bonds Owning shares should come with a higher reward for bearing the additional uncertainty about returns This reward is the equity risk premium Historically the premium has been handsome particularly in America Between 1900 and 2021 the excess real return of stocks over bonds in America was 47% a year on average according to the Credit Suisse Global Investment Returns Yearbook compiled by Elroy Dimson Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton three academicsThat is nice to know But what investors care about is prospective returns Yields to redemption are the obvious measure of the expected returns on bonds The higher the yield the greater the expected return By a similar logic the earnings yield ie the inverse of the share-price-to-earnings ratio is a decent guide to expected return on equities The gap between the earnings yield and long-term bond yields provides a forward-looking measure of the equity risk premium for long-horizon investors The higher this premium the keener investors should be to buy stocks over bondsThe chart shows a crude measure of the equity risk premium: the excess of the earnings yield on the s&p 500 index of shares over the yield on ten-year inflation-protected Treasuries The latter yield is a gauge of long-term real interest rates and so is a proxy for prospective risk-free returns for a long-term investor The risk premium varies over time because people risk appetite varies with the circumstances During the dotcom boom of the late 1990s for instance the equity risk premium was negative Another salient feature is the severe spikes in the premium during periods of extreme stress such as during the Great Recession in 2008-09 and the euro-zone crisis in 2011-12The current reading is broadly in line with the average over the past two decades It is also little changed from the start of the year A couple of implications follow from this First the bear market has been largely warranted by the sharp rise in expected interest rates now embedded in real bond yields Share prices have fallen but the equity risk premium has been broadly constant You might say that not much has changed with regard to the attractiveness of American shares That would not be quite right It would be truer to say that equity prices are now based on more realistic expectations of future interest ratesA second implication is that equity investors are not especially fearfulor at least their worst fears are not reflected in share prices For now recession is a forecast It is not yet a reality History suggests that in recessions American share prices fall even more sharply than they have this year Panic usually sets in And a panic is often a good buying opportunity Should such an opportunity arise again though do not imagine that it would be easy to take advantage of It takes nerve to buy when markets are plunging You can always convince yourself that an even better opportunity is around the corner Delay always seems advisable And delay often ends up meaning not making a decision at all The opportunity is missed Readers may sense a familiar conclusion coming: that market timing is a snare In this regard it is worth thinking about Mr Buffett quote in full It is only “if they [investors] insist on trying to time their participation in equities” he said that they should try to be greedy when others are fearful Mr Buffett was cautioning against a “start-and-stop” approach to the stockmarket which often leads to investors missing out on returns There are worse times to buy stocks than after a big fall But for most temperaments buying and holding for the long haul is usually the best policyRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Is trading on America stockmarket fair?

Japan has long suffered from too-low inflation although rising commodity prices have pushed the headline rate a little higher Elsewhere part of the explanation lies in the spread of two diseases An outbreak of African swine fever from 2018 to 2021 devastated the pig population in China where as many as 200m pigs were culled according to some estimates This dramatically increased the price of pork a staple food in East Asia The price has subsequently fallen back sharply In mainland China for example the price of pork fell by more than 21% in the year to May This helped offset inflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy It also helps that East Asia unlike other parts of the world eats more rice than wheat The price of rice has risen by 8% since Russia invaded Ukraine whereas wheat prices have increased by 17%The other anti-inflationary disease in the region is covid-19 Many parts of Asia turned to living with the virus more slowly and reluctantly than in the West Indonesia for example did not entirely abandon quarantine for international arrivals until March 22nd In Malaysia travel and movement did not return to normal until early May a full month after the country entered its official “transition to endemic” phase according to an index of social restrictions developed by Goldman Sachs a bank Taiwan remains cautious even now Its success in keeping covid at bay in the past has left its population with little natural immunity and less of the West fatalism about the diseaseChina of course continues to impose stringent restrictions on people movement and gathering wherever infections appear The recent lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere hampered both the economy ability to supply goods and its consumers’ willingness to buy them This twin disruption to supply and demand could in theory move prices either way But the damage to consumer spending seems to be more severe and persistent In May the second month of Shanghai lockdown retail sales fell by almost 10% in real terms compared with a year earlier even as industrial production rose by 07%Limits on cross-border travel have been devastating to the economies of Hong Kong and especially Macau which relies on visitors from the mainland to fill its casinos Indeed Macau gdp in the first three months of this year was less than half the size it reached in the same months of 2019 In that context inflation of 1% does not seem so miraculously low Indeed it is a wonder that prices are rising at all For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 19th 2022,People inflation expectations are risingand will be hard to bring down,Consumer prices across the rich world are rising by more than 9% year on year the highest rate since the 1980s Worryingly there is growing evidence that the public is starting to expect consistently high inflation Figures suggesting that Americans’ medium-term expectations of inflation had risen helped set off the market turmoil in early June which culminated in the Federal Reserve raising interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point Central banks urgently need to convince people that they are serious about getting inflation down But a range of evidence suggests that changing the public mind could be extraordinarily difficult Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe difference in views of expert and lay groups has become gaping Bernardo Candia Olivier Coibion and Yuriy Gorodnichenko three economists look at the inflation expectations of four groups in America Those of professional forecasters and financial markets remain close to the Fed target of 2% But consumers’ beliefs increasingly do not They expect prices to rise by more than 5% over the next year Firms exposed to surging commodity wage and other input costs expect higher inflation still Expectations are rising outside America too A dataset put together by the Cleveland Fed Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University gauges public inflation expectations in various places In May 2021 respondents in the median rich country thought inflation over the next year would be 23% Now they expect a rate of 42% Central banks face a problem in getting these expectations down again This is because few people aside from investors and financial journalists pay much notice to what they say A new paper by Alan Blinder of Princeton University and colleagues puts it more drily: “Households and firms have a low desire to be informed about monetary policy” A survey in 2014 found that only a quarter of Americans could pick out Janet Yellen as the then-chairwoman of the Fed from a list of four Two-fifths of Americans believe that the Fed inflation target exceeds 10% Small wonder that the impact of its policy announcements on inflation expectations is “muted” according to a recent study by Fiorella De Fiore of the Bank for International Settlements and colleagues Nor are Americans alone In the late 2000s researchers at the Bank of Italy assessed whether people knew what inflation was Many had only a fuzzy understandingwith half of respondents confusing price changes with price levels In recent years Japan has implemented forceful monetary easing in order to boost inflation But in 2021 more than 40% of Japanese people had “never heard” of the plan according to an official survey In the years before the pandemic public apathy to monetary policy did not much matter Inflation was low and stable Now it matters a lot Spiralling expectations could become embedded in wages and prices pushing headline inflation higher still Central bankers’ conventional toolkits may do little to bring them down Even the effect of raising interest rates is not totally clear: twice as many Americans believe that higher rates raise inflation than reduce it according to a recent The Economist/YouGov poll What more can be done? History points to several options One is to make drastic or unexpected announcements This could involve raising interest rates outside of scheduled meetingsa decision taken by India central bank in May The European Central Bank ecb has used this trick in pursuit of another goal: keeping down government-bond spreads which would otherwise threaten a debt crisis In 2012 Mario Draghi then the head of the bank made an impromptu promise to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro According to research by Michael Ehrmann of the ecb and Alena Wabitsch of Oxford University the words generated high traffic on Twitter among non-experts suggesting they had cut through The genius of the statement other research suggests was that it focused on the end “preserve the euro” rather than the means “buying bonds” which is easier for the public to understand The ecb has tried to repeat the trick more recently such as by calling an emergency meeting to address widening spreads Others have played the long game Paul Volcker the Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987 cultivated a reputation as what economists call an inflation “nutter”: someone willing to tolerate high unemployment to defeat the beast The public eventually got the message A recent paper by Jonathon Hazell of the London School of Economics and others argues that post-Volcker “shifts in beliefs about the long-run monetary regime” proved more important than any other factor in conquering inflation before covid-19 Andrew Bailey the head of the Bank of England has been trying to embrace his inner Volcker such as by giving Britons the impression that he cares more about inflation than he does their wages Public enemy number oneAnother solution is for politicians to get involved This has potential drawbacks because they often advocate crackpot anti-inflation schemes such as price controls Still they might be able to help After all 37% of Americans believe that the president has “a lot” of control over inflation compared with 34% for the Fed Jimmy Carter appointment of Volcker in 1979 showed that he was serious about getting inflation down In Britain Margaret Thatcher and her henchmen talked tough on price stability; their willingness to slash government budgets probably backed up those words by cooling the economy Today in America President Joe Biden says that “fighting inflation” is his “top economic priority” though he shows less inclination to tighten fiscal policy Public apathy towards central banking may be a backhanded compliment to the policymakers of the 1980s and 1990s No one needed to care about inflation when it was low Today policymakers are constrained by that very success To get inflation expectations back down then they may need to try everything in their power to get people to sit up and listen Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession Jun 16thA focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thShould China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 16th 2022,Is trading on America stockmarket fair?,In everyday parlance equity means fairness To an investor or a stockbroker though it is an ownership stake The word means both things thanks to the English Court of Chancery which operated from around the 15th to the 19th centuries and handed out rulings based on “equity” or fairness rather than common law Under common law a borrower who missed a mortgage payment would forfeit their land but in Chancery they could reclaim it by repaying the debt Over time “equity” came to mean the ownership stake in property itself Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday legal and regulatory systems are tasked with ensuring that finance is fair And Gary Gensler the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission America markets watchdog is not happy In a speech on June 8th he worried that “market segmentation and concentration” mean there is no longer a “level playing-field” in the stockmarket It is “not clear” he said that the “market system is as fair and competitive as possible for investors”A fair market is transparent accessible and uses a reasonable method to arrange buyers and sellersthink of a public farmers’ market with clearly stated prices and an orderly queue A decade ago this was a decent if simplified description of most equity trades Three-quarters of them by volume were conducted on public exchanges; only a quarter were done “off-exchange” No more In 2021 during the “meme-stock” craze when retail bets sent GameStop shares soaring the share of off-exchange trades swelled to a peak of 47% Retail punters are far less likely to have their orders executed on public exchanges than institutional investors More than 90% of retail orders are sent to a concentrated group of marketmakers that pay brokers to deliver the orders to them a practice called payment for order flow At first glance this system is not obviously bad for retail investors BrokersCharles Schwab say or Robinhoodare obliged to seek “best execution” for their customers In order to direct a retail order to a marketmaker like Citadel Securities or Virtu they must beat the prevailing price offered by public exchangesthe so-called “national best bid and offer” nbboa feature known as “price improvement” That means retail traders probably get better prices than most institutions Marketmakers are happy to pay for their business because the flows are not risky It is easy to match retail flows against each other By matching trades they can give a lower price than the best offer to the buyer a higher price than the best bid to the seller and have some left overa slice of which they pay to the broker and the rest of which they keep The payments mean brokers do not need to charge customers commissionYet there are flaws Post-trade price improvement makes it impossible for punters to know ahead of trading which broker would ultimately give them the best execution price As Mr Gensler put it “price improvement without competition…is not necessarily the best price improvement” Marketmakers and brokers might start to hang on to more of the benefits instead of passing them on to punters Larry Tabb of Bloomberg a data firm has found that American retail investors in March 2022 collected 47% of the benefit $37bn on an annualised basis while brokers were paid 13%$900m The marketmakers themselves took some 40% $31bnMoreover the system of price improvement relative to the nbbo only benefits customers if the nbbo is a good benchmarka claim that is getting shakier For a start the nbbo is measured for orders of 100 shares or more This was sensible in 2014 when just 15% of trades were in smaller quantities By March 2022 though the share had climbed to 55% And if trading volumes continue to move off-exchange the benchmarks will become ever less meaningful One solution from Mr Gensler is for exchanges to hold auctions for retail stock orders a practice typically used to fill retail orders for equity derivatives By redirecting retail flows to exchanges this would radically reshape American stockmarketsto the benefit of exchanges and the detriment of marketmakersand is therefore likely to be fiercely resisted Hours after Mr Gensler spoke Dan Gallagher a former sec commissioner now at Robinhood said the current structure represented “a really good climate for retail” A shakeup could face legal challenges too But Mr Gensler is right to be trying Taking a punt on today violent stockmarkets is daunting enough Investors should get a fair shot at itRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Tech investors are prizing cash generation again Jun 9thThe return of the inventory cycle Jun 2ndIs China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 15th 2022,Eight days that shook the markets,“I do not expect moves of this size to be common” said Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve on June 15th The central bank had just raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points 075 percentage points to 15%-175% It was the third increase in as many meetings and the biggest jump in short-term rates since 1994 The move was both expected and surprising Mr Powell had warmed up markets weeks ago to the prospect of a 50-basis-point increase at this monetary-policy meeting But in the days leading up to it investors had quickly and fully priced in a larger risewith more to comeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Powell comment about uncommonly large increases was enough to spark a partial reversal of the sharp rise in bond yields over the preceding days and a relief rally in share prices But however much he tried to sugar-coat the message rates are going up by a lot more and the chances of a hard landing for the economy have surely increased as a consequence Recession is now more widely expected if not yet by the Fed And the rapid changes in the market mood show just how much the Fed and other rich-world central banks have lost control of eventsThe Fed interest-rate decision came at the end of an extraordinary few days in financial markets in which bond yields shot up at a violent rate share prices plunged and riskier assets notably bitcoin but also Italian government bonds were trashed The story begins not in Washington or New York but in Sydney where on June 7th the Reserve Bank of Australia raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points citing growing worries about inflation It continued in Amsterdam where in the following days the European Central Bank ecb held its monetary-policy meeting in a break from its usual setting in Frankfurt Christine Lagarde the central bank boss confirmed that a 25-basis-point rate increase would be on the cards in July But she went much further The ecb she said expects to raise interest rates perhaps by 50 basis points in September and anticipates “sustained” increases thereafter The catalyst for this more hawkish stance was a sharp upward revision in the central bank forecasts for inflationThis set the stage for a dramatic shift in bond markets which events elsewhere added impetus to The yield on ten-year German government bonds known as bunds rose quickly to above 175% over the following days The yield on riskier sorts of euro-zone government bonds notably Italian btps rose by even more The spread excess yield on btps over bunds widened sharply taking Italy ten-year yield above 4% Indeed spreads had risen so swiftly that the ecb rate-setting council held an emergency meeting on June 15th to address the matter see next story But it was news from America that really moved markets Figures released on Friday June 10th showed that annual consumer-price inflation rose to 86% in May the highest rate since 1981 Underlying price “core” pressures were unexpectedly strong To make matters worse a survey by the University of Michigan showed that consumers’ expectations of medium-term inflation had risen markedly Taken together the reports suggested that inflation would be much harder to bring down Treasury yields rose sharply as the bond market began to price in more and faster interest-rate increases by the Fed The biggest moves were at the short end of the yield curve which is most sensitive to shifts in monetary policy Yields on two-year Treasuries rose by 57 basis points in the space of just two trading days But longer-term rates shifted too see chart 1 Stocks could hardly escape the reckoning see chart 2 The s&p 500 index of leading shares fell by 3% on June 10th and by 4% the following Monday The cumulative losses took the stockmarket firmly into bear-market territory defined as a fall of more than 20% from its recent peak The tech-heavy nasdaq index has fallen by even more Higher Treasury yields have weighed on share prices but have been a fillip to the dollar The dxy an index of the greenback against half a dozen rich-world currencies is up by 10% this year The strength is particularly marked against the yen which has fallen to a new 24-year low While the Fed is tightening policy to bring down inflation Japan central bank is furiously buying bonds in order to raise it The recent volatility particularly in the bond market has been quite extreme What might explain this? As bad as the inflation backdrop had seemed before last week investors had consoled themselves with the idea that the worst of it was now in the past The Bank of America global fund-manager survey suggests that in recent weeks investors had increased their allocation to bondsperhaps judging that bond prices had stopped falling Bond prices move inversely to yields If so the poor inflation figures caught them out A market that leans heavily in one direction often snaps back when the wind changes And poor liquidity amplifies the effect Changes in regulation have made it costlier for banks to hold large inventories of bonds to facilitate client trading The Fed once a reliable buyer of Treasuries is winding down its purchases When investors want to sell there are too few willing to take the other side of the trade The violent market moves in the days leading up to the Fed meeting may have exaggerated the sense of panic Yet it is hard to argue that investors are bullish The Bank of America survey shows that optimism among fund managers about the economic outlook is at an all-time low Can a hard landing be avoided?

 Jun 15th 2022,The European Central Bank responds to market turmoil,Surging inflation and a weakening economy are not the only worries preoccupying the European Central Bank ecb As inflation rose higher still the bank promised on June 9th to raise interest rates over the coming months and to end its asset purchases Then in subsequent days financial markets decided to remind the central bank that the new policy could mean Italy public debt at 150% of the country gdp might look wobbly as interest rates start to rise Italian government-borrowing costs started to climb Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs the yield on Italy ten-year sovereign bonds surpassed 4% the central bank called an emergency meeting on June 15th Its governing council tasked the staff with coming up with an “anti-fragmentation” tool a government-bond-buying scheme that would help prop up sovereigns in distress The announcement marks a fundamental change in how the ecb sees its role in bond marketsBeing a central banker in a monetary union is hard The euro members differ according to their growth prospects and debt levels leading to gaps “spreads” between their bond yields and the German bund yield which is regarded as the risk-free rate Investors routinely debate the threat of a country defaulting or exiting the euro By contrast there is little doubt that the Bank of England stands behind gilts; no one worries that Britain might leave sterling Differences in liquidity and the extent to which a government bonds are seen as benchmark assets matter too In a recently published paper Hanno Lustig of Stanford University and colleagues estimate that this “convenience yield” the yield that investors are willing to forgo for safety and liquidity explained more than half the variation in spreads between euro countries from 2008 to 2020 In times of stressas when the pandemic struck in March 2020investors seeking safety drive up the spread between say Italian and German bonds see chart These spreads between government bonds then translate into differing borrowing costs for firms and households Despite sharing a currency and the Alps borrowers in Tyrol Austria and South Tyrol in Italy could face quite different interest rates because their respective national governments are charged different rates by investors And too big a divergence can be a problem for the ecb because it sets short-term interest rates for the euro area as a whole The wider the spreads the less likely it is that its desired interest rate is reflected in conditions on the ground But the precise point at which spreads become wider than economic differences warrant is controversial In a speech on June 14th Isabel Schnabel a member of the ecb executive board explained the bank thinking She argued that safe interest rates were rising around the world at a time when threats to growth were becoming more prominent Widening spreads meant that financial conditions had tightened more in some parts of the euro zone than in others The ecb would seek to avoid any “disorderly repricing of risk” that could impair the functioning of monetary policy and so pose a threat to ensuring stable inflation The question is what counts as “disorderly” Shortly before the emergency meeting Italian ten-year spreads on bunds rose to 24 percentage points Not everyone agrees that was a problem Volker Wieland a former member of the German council of economic experts argues that Italy debt is not unsustainable and that spreads did not warrant action by the ecb In addition he points out the ecb already has the means to contain panicky rises in spreads Yet the existing tool outright monetary transactions omtannounced in 2012 when Mario Draghi the ecb former president said he would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the eurohas become politically toxic It comes with tough conditionsnamely that the countries in need of ecb support subject themselves to an imf-style reform programme Luis Garicano a Spanish member of the European Parliament argues that the ecb will seek to recreate omt without the toxicity The central bank itself has been at pains to emphasise that any new tool to contain spreads would “remain within its mandate”: in other words that any bond purchases would be either limited or tied to conditions Unless the euro zone comes closer to being a federal entity with a common finance ministry and shared taxes and benefits spreads will be a fact of life Further banking or fiscal integration could help narrow them without central-bank action But progress on those cannot be counted upon With its announcement the ecb has made clear that it sees managing spreads as part of its job For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 15th 2022,The construction industry remains horribly climate-unfriendly,Covid-induced lockdowns may have upended the world of work but they have not killed the skyscraper Even as workers stay home to avoid the commute cities’ penchant for these concrete marvels of engineering continues unabated In midtown Manhattan JPMorgan Chase has knocked down its old headquarters in favour of a new glass tower that will rise 18 storeys higher Across the city more than a dozen supertall structureswhich rise higher than 300mare in the works In London where gleaming new landmarks are given irreverent nicknames such as “Walkie Talkie” or “The Gherkin” more than 200 towers have transformed the skyline since 2009 The construction frenzy is not limited to big cities By one estimate the planet will add floor space the size of New York City every month until 2060 Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSome worry that this pace of construction could literally cost the Earth Today buildings are responsible for almost 40% of global energy-related carbon emissions with homes alone accounting for nearly 20% Property emissions are a combination of two things The first is the day-to-day running of a building: energy used to light up heat or cool homes office blocks and shopping malls The carbon produced in this way is “operational” in the vernacular and accounts for 27% of all annual carbon emissions globally The other type is “embodied” carbon which refers to emissions tied to the building process maintenance and any demolition Overall embodied carbon is responsible for around 10% of annual emissions though it will vary depending on the type of buildingWorryingly the carbon footprint of buildings is growing On the current path carbon emissions related to buildings are expected to double by 2050 It is true that in 2020 emissions from managing property fell after hitting a record high in 2019 according to the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction Globalabc an industry body But that was mostly owing to lockdowns which lowered emissions from all sorts of other activities too Efforts to build greener played a minimal role Worse still advances in building energy efficiency are stalling The global rate of annual improvement fell by half between 2016 and 2019 according to Globalabc tracker which measures indicators such as incremental investment in the energy performance of buildings along with the share of renewable-energy use Policymakers are scrambling to find solutions New energy-efficiency standards for buildings in England and Wales mean that one in ten offices in central London risks becoming obsolete in 2023 Nearly 60% could become unusable by 2027 Across the eu where nearly two-thirds of the building stock relies on fossil fuels for heating and cooling officials want nearly half of a building energy to come from renewable sources by 2030 Cities are setting lofty targets too New York is aiming for carbon-free electricity by 2040; Los Angeles for zero-emissions buildings by 2050 Hot propertyHomeowners are also being urged to go green In Britain energy-performance requirements for new homes will be dramatically tightened from 2025 In Italy the government has pledged to cover the full cost of green renovations plus an extra 10% to incentivise those still unsure about switching through tax deductions of up to €100000 $104000 per home More than €21bn has been paid out since the scheme was launched in July 2020Even so progress is slow To meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement global emissions must hit net zero between 2050 and 2070 Today less than 1% of buildings are net-zero Nudging homeowners is proving challenging Total greenhouse-gas emissions for American houses have fallen by 2% since 2005 versus the 7% that would be consistent with the Paris agreement according to Citigroup a bank This is mirrored in many big economies In Britain the CO2-equivalent emissions of homes fell by around 1m tonnes between 2018 and 2019less than half the cuts made by the transport sector Three obstacles make it harder to build sustainably First the property industry has focused almost entirely on making buildings more efficient to run at the expense of embodied carbon emissions As a result little progress has been made on monitoring and restricting embodied carbon Britain for example has passed legislation requiring new homes to produce at least 75% less carbon from 2025 Yet it places no limits on the upfront carbon emissions needed to build or dispose of themThere are exceptions The Netherlands has required whole-life carbon assessments for some large buildings since 2013 California imposes carbon-intensity limits on certain construction materials For now embodied carbon accounts for a smaller share of global emissions than the operational sort But that will change as buildings become more energy-efficient In many modern buildings embodied carbon already represents as much as half of total lifetime emissions The second hurdle is the indestructible appeal of the wrecking ball The building sector would sooner knock down a structure than reuse it resulting in a carbon-intensive cycle of demolition and construction This is partly because the costs of revamping properties often exceeds their value Tax structures across the rich world incentivise demolition over reuse For example until March 2022 most new buildings in Britain were exempt from value-added tax while most renovation and repairs were liable for vat at 20% vat has since been scrapped on some energy-efficiency measures but will rise from 2027This economic model is costly for the planet Construction gobbles up nearly all of the world cement half of all steel production and around a quarter of aluminium output and plastics all of which spew vast amounts of emissions a year In the process construction generates around a third of the eu waste measured by weight In Britain construction demolition and excavation amounts to nearly two-thirds of all waste produced Pockets of the sector are innovating Startups venture capitalists and some cement-makers are all looking either to replace concrete or to make it greener New methods such as modular construction which reduces waste by assembling components in a factory before moving them on-site are also gaining traction Nearly half of new homes in Finland Norway and Sweden are factory-built Yet the overall pace of innovation is desultory because of a third obstacle: the chronically underwhelming productivity of the construction sector as a whole Global productivity growth in the industry has long lagged behind that of the wider economy Building methods for new homes have barely evolved in over a century At the same time the pandemic has exacerbated long-standing labour shortages in construction The sector was already struggling to produce enough tradespeople skilled in building sustainably Meanwhile calls to go green will only grow more urgent Population growth and voracious demand for housing mean the size of the built environment is expanding at a faster rate than efforts to slash energy use An explosion of new buildings in China South-East Asia and Africa will continue to fuel construction In these places more than half of all buildings that will exist 30 years from now have not yet been built If the world is to reach net-zero emissions the construction sector will need to make enormous stridesand fast For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter And for more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Jun 14th 2022,The Fed flawed plan to avoid a recession,American economists are no longer hawks or doves but optimists or pessimists With annual inflation running at 86% in May everyone agrees the Federal Reserve needs to raise interest rates sharply and on June 15th it did so by 075 percentage points The disagreement now is not over whether the Fed must fight inflation but how painful the consequences will be Pessimists point to the long history of bouts of monetary-policy tightening being followed by recessions Optimists say the Fed can bring inflation down to its 2% target merely by slowing economic growthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Fed is in the optimists’ camp In a recent speech Christopher Waller one of the central bank rate-setters spelt out the argument It hinges on America hot labour market There were almost twice as many job openings as there were unemployed workers in April with the ratio near a record high reached in March And wages are more than 5% higher than a year ago Such is the heat that McDonalds is cutting workers from the kitchen by shrinking its menus Although wage growth is slowing a little the obvious imbalance between the demand for workers and their supply means the Fed cannot count on further cooling Without it prices are likely to continue rising fast too as workers spend their incomes and firms pass on their costsA pessimist would see plentiful job openings as a sign of how out of whack the labour market has become on the Fed watch The central bank sees them as evidence that it can cool things down without turfing anyone out of a job Fewer vacancies and therefore less competition for workers might lower wage growth and inflation without raising unemployment This idea motivates the belief of Jerome Powell the Fed chairman that the economy could face only “some pain” from disinflationakin to suffering from the side-effects of an inoculation rather than the diseaseThe argument can be cast as one about the slope of the “Beveridge curve” which traces the relationship between the vacancy and unemployment rates It is named after William Beveridge a British economist who in 1944 established the importance of vacancies in determining unemployment The curve is a mysterious beast It often shifts outwards during recessions as it did after the global financial crisis when more vacancies were needed to support any given level of unemployment Economists speculated that it had become harder to match workers to jobs perhaps because they were in the wrong place or had the wrong skillsSince covid-19 struck the Beveridge curve has moved outwards more dramatically still perhaps reflecting the rise of home working the decline of city centres and changing patterns of consumer spending see chart Its recent shape suggests that were vacancies to return to their 2019 level when the labour market was arguably last in balance the unemployment rate would rise from 36% today to more than 6% That is hard to imagine without an accompanying economic contraction A rise of just 05 percentage points in the three-month average unemployment rate from its low over the preceding 12 months is an indicator of recession Every time it has occurred since 1950 it has either coincided with or shortly been followed by a downturna principle known as the “Sahm rule” named for Claudia Sahm an American economist Mr Waller however thinks that the shape of the Beveridge curve will change again as vacancies fall The curve outward shift during the pandemic reflects firing as well as hiring: lots of workers lost their jobs early on Layoffs increase the unemployment rate for a given level of vacancies and push out the Beveridge curve Today though few workers are being sacked Perhaps the Fed can manage to cool the economy and as a result lower the vacancy rate but without increasing layoffs In this scenario the curve would be steeper on the way down than it was on the way up Reducing the vacancy rate to its 2019 level while holding layoffs constant would imply only a modest rise in unemployment to around 45% Though that would still trigger the Sahm rule “the past is not always prescriptive of the future” said Mr Waller noting that vacancies have never before been so highThe perils of positive thinkingThe Fed maths are sound Yet its argument looks like the latest instance of over-optimism among monetary policymakers who have downplayed the extent of the inflation scare and underestimated the action needed to fight it Why would tighter policy shrink vacancies but not increase layoffs? Higher interest rates reduce consumption and investment which might cause the weakest firms to shrink or even shut down Mr Waller said that “outside of recessions layoffs don’t change much” Yet recession is precisely the outcome that pessimists fear will follow from higher rates The historical record backs up that worryand provides little support for the Fed argument Research by Alex Domash and Larry Summers both of Harvard University and firmly in the pessimists’ camp finds that there has never been an instance in which the vacancy rate has fallen substantially without unemployment rising significantly within two years A reduction in vacancies of 20% is associated with on average a three-percentage-point rise in the unemployment ratecomparable with what is implied by the recent Beveridge curve Mr Waller argument implies a drop in vacancies of fully 35%A final problem with the Fed plan is that it does not preclude persistent inflation Even if the labour market returns to balance inflation could stay high if workers and firms come to expect rapid price increases In economics textbooks it is high inflation expectations not the difficulty of bringing demand back into line with supply that makes it hard to slow price rises without causing a recession That is why it is such bad news that people long-term inflation expectations have recently risen noticeably according to a survey of consumers by the University of Michigan Getting expectations down typically means running the economy cold Each time the Fed is proved to have been overly optimistic its credibility ebbs making a dire outcome more likely Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery Jun 9thShould China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 13th 2022,America inflation headache gets worse,Editor note June 14th 2022: this story was updated to reflect new expectations of higher rate rises by the FedIn an alternate universe America clearly passed its peak in inflation a couple of months ago; the Federal Reserve is still talking tough but investors have started to expect less monetary tightening a great relief for stockmarkets; and Joe Biden can at last sense victory over rising prices arguably the greatest nemesis of his presidency thus far Until a few days ago many thought America would be inhabiting that other world Alas a brutal batch of data has awoken them to a more dispiriting reality Inflation far from peaking seems to be gaining altitude with potentially dramatic consequences for the Fed for investors and for American politicsOn June 10th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that the consumer-price index in May was 86% higher than a year earlier the fastest annual rate of inflation since 1981 More concerning was the momentum Month on month consumer prices rose by 1% well above the 03% increase in AprilAdding to the grim news was a plunge in consumer sentiment to a record low as measured by a closely watched survey from the University of Michigan The principal cause was stubbornly high inflation Consumers now expect an average inflation rate of 33% over the next five to ten years up from their expectation of just 3% a month earlier This does not yet mean that inflation expectations are “unanchored”a much-dreaded condition that could set the stage for an upward spiral in pricesbut it certainly is enough to stir fear at the Fed The broadening of inflationary pressures from goods such as cars and electronics to wages and rental costs darkens the backdrop And motorists will have noticed the surging price of petrol which for the first time ever now exceeds $5 a gallon Had America been in the more benign alternate universe talk now would have centred on when the Fed might be able to adopt a more relaxed posture Indeed as recently as May 23rd Raphael Bostic president of the Fed branch in Atlanta said the central bank may want to pause its interest-rate increases at its meeting in September in order to take stock of all the latest developments Such restraint now seems off the table Instead market pricing has shifted in a far more hawkish direction Most investors now think the Fed will raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on June 15th at the conclusion of a regular rate-setting meeting The last time that the Fed delivered such a jumbo rate rise was in 1994 under Alan Greenspan Moreover many expect that the Fed will follow up with yet another three-quarter-point increase at its next meeting in July and then a half-point in September That would make for the fastest pace of tightening since the 1980sThe prospect of the central bank slamming on the monetary brakes has unnerved markets The S&P 500 Wall Street flagship stock index has tumbled by 5% since the inflation data were released Tech stocks from Amazon to Tesla have sold off even more sharply And for some high-risk assets the carnage has been far worse The price of Bitcoin fell by more than 10% on June 13th after Celsius a cryptocurrency lending firm paused all withdrawals from its platform because of “extreme market conditions” The historical record suggests that America would be lucky to escape a recession when the Fed tightens so aggressivelyFor Mr Biden administration the economic frustrations are only deepening On one hand inflation is much more than just an American problem In Britain consumer prices have been rising even faster hitting an annual pace of 9% in April From Germany to Australia inflationary pressures are bubbling up Even Japan long mired in deflation is not immune The rapid ascent in food and energy prices caused in large part by Russia invasion of Ukraine is a global affliction Continuing snags in cross-border supply chains stemming from the covid-19 pandemic have made matters worse Mark Zandi an economist with Moody Analytics an arm of a credit-rating agency estimates that Russia war and the lingering covid pandemic account for nearly two-thirds of the annual rise in inflation over the past yearOn the other hand American voters will not be so forensic in their analysis of price trends nor so forgiving in their assessment of Mr Biden responsibility Just over 500 days into his presidency 49% of Americans disapprove of his performance while 41% approve according to weekly opinion polls conducted by The Economist and YouGov That negative gap of eight percentage points puts Mr Biden in a weak position at this point in the electoral cycle albeit in a slightly better one than Donald Trump at the same time in his presidency Mid-term elections due to be held in November rarely go well for the president party Sky-high inflation could make them an unmitigated disaster for Democrats with Republicans on track to wrest control from them of both the Senate and the House of Representatives Mr Biden has tried to direct attention to the millions of jobs recovered over the past year as America claws its way back from the pandemic But the soaring cost of living and the rising prospect of recession are instead top of mind 
 Jun 9th 2022,Refiners are providing a fresh source of drama for oil markets,America driving season has officially begun Despite rising inflation and the lingering threat of the pandemic motorists hit the highways with gusto over the recent Memorial Day long weekend Some 40m Americans travelled by road an increase of 83% on the same weekend a year earlier That wanderlust came even as prices at the pump were about 50% above last year levels driven by an intense squeeze on global refiningListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn normal times the refining business is a low-margin low-drama adjunct to the geopolitically charged upstream business of oil production and the politically charged downstream business of retail sales Refiners typically make profit margins of $5-10 a barrel and often go through painful spells of unprofitability This time however refining is playing a starring rolethe machinations of the oil-producing countries war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russian oil exports notwithstanding Margins for many refiners have rocketed and bottlenecks in the sector are propelling global petrol prices upwards Three factors explain why refining is in the limelight The first is a long-term decline in investment in advanced economies With oil demand in the rich world forecast to plunge over the next two decades investors are unwilling to spend many billions of dollars on facilities that could become stranded assets Adding to this is environmental pressure on refining which is seen as especially dirty and regulations in California and Europe that favour greener fuels Outside China and the Middle East where capacity is expanding refining capacity has plunged by some 3m barrels per day bpd since the start of the pandemic reckons Alan Gelder of Wood Mackenzie an energy consultancy The second factor that has roiled the refining business is Chinese policymaking China has historically been a net exporter of refined products sending large volumes to other Asian countries In an attempt to fight local pollution and help meet climate targets however officials have cut export quotas for big refiners of gasoline jet fuel and other products by more than 50% this year On official plans China is set to stop exporting most carbon-intensive refined products altogether by 2025 The perverse result is that it is sitting on roughly 7% of global spare capacity even as the rest of the world thirsts for transport fuels The third big disruptive force is of course Russia war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions imposed on its exports of hydrocarbons America and Britain have banned purchases of Russian oil; the eu has announced a partial embargo on crude imports including one on refined products later this year The effect of all this is not clear-cut By widespread accounts including from tanker-tracking experts Russia is now exporting more crude oil than it did before the war It is selling lots of cut-rate crude to India in particular which is importing over 700000 barrels a day more than it did before the invasion When it comes to refined products though both official sanctions and the voluntary “self sanctions” embraced by Western firms seem to be biting According to Natasha Kaneva of JPMorgan Chase a bank Russia is selling roughly 500000 fewer barrels of refined product a day than it was before the war and may have been forced to shut down as much as 14m bpd of refining capacity in May The result is an unprecedented shift argues Richard Joswick of s&p Global a research firm: “The world has plenty of refining capacity but the spare capacity is moving into Russia and China” As a result he reckons that utilisation rates for refiners in the rest of the world will be much higher than previously envisioned The refining crunch could continue for a while yet The coming Atlantic hurricane season which is forecast to be stronger than normal may shut down refineries in the Gulf of Mexico Another factor is the precise timing and intensity of Europe latest round of sanctions on Russian oil exports If implemented aggressively these could further squeeze the sector Market forces could yet save the day The painful price spikes seen at petrol pumps will eventually cool demand a little and could lead to improvements in energy efficiency both of which will help balance markets A shift in trade flows could also come to Europe aid India world-class refiners for instance are turning global crisis into local opportunity rbc Capital Markets an investment firm reckons that the country “is becoming the de facto refining hub for Europe” Big new refineries are scheduled to come online soon in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia which should help ease the shortages too As Mr Joswick observes “With margins this large everybody has an incentive to run refineries flat out” Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Jun 9th 2022,Mighty Asian financial institutions are reshaping global capital flows,When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates the effects are felt far and wide Capital shifts in and out of the huge stock of global dollar-denominated assets The Fed is expected to act forcefully over the next year raising rates to around 3% the highest level since early 2008 But this time the response of the biggest foreign holders of dollar assets particularly those in Asia could hold surprises A burgeoning group of large private institutions is changing and potentially complicating the pictureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTen years ago “official” foreign investorsmainly central banks managing their currency reservesheld $34trn in American Treasuries about three-quarters of all Treasuries held abroad Anyone wanting to understand the huge flows in and out of dollar bonds therefore kept an eagle eye on the big reserve managers There has been plenty of movement of late China reservesthe largest single foreign stash of Treasuriesfell by $68bn in April 2% of the total and the largest monthly drop in more than five years Japan reserves declined by $31bn the biggest-ever monthly fall India reserves shrank by $26bn in March the most since the market panic of October 2008 Those in South Korea and Taiwan have fallen too Reserve managers are a tight-lipped bunch and rarely explain precisely why their holdings have changed But some of the recent declines are likely to reflect simple valuation effects The dollar has strengthened; as a result holdings denominated in other currencies such as the euro are worth fewer dollars Some reserve managers have also intervened in the market by selling their holdings in order to limit currency depreciation Yet this presents an increasingly partial picture of capital flows Asian private institutions that cater to ageing populations such as pension funds and insurers have exploded in recent years The assets of Taiwan life insurers alone for instance have more than doubled in less than a decade Rather like central banks these tend to buy and hold safe government bonds and liquid corporate debtAs a consequence the share of Treasuries owned by official investors has fallen to 58% of all Treasuries held abroad Private foreign holdings make up the rest and have risen from $11trn to $28trn over the past decade Sales and purchases of Treasuries by private investors can swamp those made by official investors as recent trends have made clear Official investors sold $36bn in Treasuries to American punters in the first three months of this year That looks measly compared with the purchases made by foreign private investors They snapped up $235bn in Treasuries the biggest haul in any quarter on record This divergence makes sense Reserve managers get out of Treasuries when American interest rates climb to protect their currencies from a stronger dollar Private investors enticed by juicier yields on long-dated bonds dive in Even quasi-public institutions like Japan and South Korea mammoth state-pension schemes have goals and risk tolerances that differ from reserve managers Nonetheless because most of the newly important institutions grew rapidly during a period of low inflation and rock-bottom interest rates predicting their actions as circumstances change will not be easy Things are murkiest of all in China where the aims of financial institutions and the government foreign-exchange managers can dovetail In 2020 and 2021 for instance China official reserves were curiously stable raising analysts’ eyebrows While most other Asian countries with large trade surpluses were reporting surging reserves China rose by less than 5% That raised the possibility that China was using its banks to intervene in the market: Alex Etra of Exante Data a research firm and Brad Setser of the Council on Foreign Relations a think-tank have pointed to the surging value of Chinese lenders’ net foreign assets as evidence of hidden intervention So far this year though there is little indication that China has used its state banks to disguise intervention Interpreting the shifts in capital flows was hardly easy when it involved deciphering the actions of relatively taciturn reserve managers The new more crowded field of investors with various holdings strategies and objectives will give analysts an even bigger headache For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 9th 2022,A focus on GDP understates the strength of America recovery,It is fashionable in some circles to lament the “cult of gross domestic product” The pursuit of growth this criticism goes blinds officials to less quantifiable but worthier objectives be it a contented population or a clean environment For many economists the concern about gdp is very different They see huge value in the core mission of the measure: namely to provide as timely and accurate a snapshot of the state of the economy as possible a lodestar for governments setting policies and for companies making decisions Their criticism instead is that gdp occasionally struggles to achieve this and that better alternatives might exist Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis debate has again come to the fore in America because of an unprecedented gap between gdp and its close relative gross domestic income gdi In theory the two ought to be aligned gdp tracks all expenditure in the economy summing up the market value of consumption investment government spending and net exports in a specific period gdi tracks the earnings associated with that expenditure summing up wages profits and any other income In reality the two never match up perfectly since the long-suffering bean-counters in statistical agencies must draw on different sources released at different times to tot them upThe gap between gdi and gdp officially known as “the statistical discrepancy” is typically about 1% Since late 2020 however the discrepancy has been much larger In the first quarter of this year America gdi was fully 35% larger than its gdp That is much more than a rounding error As Ben Harris and Neil Mehrotra of the Treasury Department wrote on May 26th when the latest gdi data were released it results in remarkably different pictures of the economy If gdp is the better reflection of reality economic output is still about 2% below its pre-pandemic trend If gdi is accurate the economy is 12% above trend a far stronger recoveryOne approach to reconciling gdp and gdi is just to split the difference In 2015 the Council of Economic Advisers in Barack Obama White House laid out the case for doing so calling the average the “gross domestic output” gdo The crucial point is that both gdp and gdi derive from entirely independent gauges of output Combining them should on average reduce measurement errors Mr Obama advisers found that gdo was an excellent predictor of later revisions to gdp For instance when gdo growth is half a percentage point faster than gdp growth it is associated with a subsequent upward revision to gdp growth by roughly half a percentage point This observation is slowly creeping into mainstream thinking The Bureau of Economic Analysis has started publishing the simple average of gdp and gdi though few journalists or analysts bother to mention it in their reportsAccounting for the huge discrepancy at present is somewhat trickier A useful starting point is the observation that the gdi-gdp gap opened up at the height of the covid-19 pandemic as the government stimulus flowed into the economy The sudden infusion of cash through transfers to households and loans to businesses appears to have messed up conventional measures of economic activity Corporate profits have been uncharacteristically strong explaining the vigour in gdi In principle that should have been mirrored in much more robust gdp readings tooMatthew Klein the author of “The Overshoot” an economics newsletter and who worked at The Economist a decade ago reckons that an undercounting of business investment in gdp may be the most likely cause Statisticians have struggled to keep tabs on all the newfangled ways that companies spend money from software to cloud computing During the pandemic entire business models were upended to accommodate online shopping and remote working; it stands to reason that investment data may have failed to capture such spendingAnother possibility running in the opposite direction is that incomes have been overstated Some people and even businesses may have mistakenly inflated their incomes at least in a statistical sense Dean Baker of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research a left-leaning think-tank noted back in 2011 that there was a correlation between asset bubbles and gdi When the stockmarket soars as it did during much of 2020 and 2021 gdi tends to outstrip gdp Capital gains are not supposed to count as income in gdp calculations as they reflect the prices of existing assets rather than production of new ones But the pattern suggests that people sometimes may misreport capital gains as ordinary incomeNerds to the rescueThe uncertainty about whether to blame the discrepancy on undercounted business investment or overstated income does seem to argue in favour of the simple gdi-gdp average as a measure of economic output That however is not entirely satisfactory In a paper in 2010 Jeremy Nalewaik then an economist with the Federal Reserve showed that gdi was generally closer to the mark than gdp in registering fluctuations in the business cycle It did a better job of documenting the true extent of the downturn in 2007-09 Moreover its outperformance relative to gdp over the past two years is also more consistent with the run-up in inflation Policymakers who had paid more attention to gdi may have become more concerned sooner about economic overheatingFrustratingly initial gdi estimates come out a month after the first gdp figures But researchers are on the case In a paper published in January by the Cleveland Fed economists pulled together gdp gdi and a basket of monthly indicators such as the unemployment rate and average hours worked in manufacturing The result they hope is something closer to “true gdp” that can be updated on a monthly basis Encouragingly it performed well in documenting the recovery from the pandemic If it proves itself over time it will be one more in a dizzying array of indicators to keep track of But the message is clear: a focus on conventional gdp alone is unduly restrictive at best and misleading at worst Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Should China spend more on infrastructure?

 Jun 9th 2022,Tech investors are prizing cash generation again,Iconic hip-hop artists are rarely mentioned alongside Warren Buffett or Benjamin Graham as sources of investing wisdom But Wu-Tang Clan 1994 hit “CREAM” immortalised a saying all investors should be familiar with: Cash Rules Everything Around Me Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor much of the post-pandemic boom in equity markets cash and the gauges of corporate valuation that are associated with it were deeply out of fashion Money was cheap nearly free particularly for technology companies Investors tripped over each other to finance fast-growing startups with only the fuzziest plans for achieving profitability Some large listed companies reached absurd valuations relative to their ability to generate cash That has changed dramatically over the past six months As interest rates have risen reducing the present value of future profits a company ability to generate cashflows today has become relevant again This is perhaps causing the most upheaval in tech where many stocks are priced for profit growth well into the future That technology stocks have led the recent sell-off is well-known But the shift goes deeper as an analysis of their average free-cashflow yield in 2019-21 reveals This measure takes the money a company generates after operating expenses and capital investment are accounted for and divides it by its market capitalisation providing a gauge of the size of its cash streams relative to market value Take global listed tech firms that were worth more than $1bn at the start of 2020 and divide them into two groups: the hares whose valuations raced ahead of their cash-generating ability resulting in below-average free-cashflow yields; and the more plodding tortoises with above-average yields Between the end of 2019 and the peak of America nasdaq index in November last year the share price of the median hare rose by around 24%; the tortoise by 15% Since then however the hares have tumbled by around 22% compared with only 8% for the tortoises Over the two periods as a whole the cheaper tortoises have outperformed their dearer peers by around six percentage points The division between the hares and the tortoises is not perfectthough Tesla for instance has fallen recently it has still done spectacularly over the period as a whole despite relatively low free-cashflow yields Yet the trend is clear and extends beyond tech too An American exchange-traded fund targeting the 100 companies in the Russell 1000 index with the highest free-cashflow yields is up by about 8% this year The shift towards a cash-focused equity market will be felt most acutely in tech however precisely because it was where the excesses of the previous regime were so evident The beneficiaries of the new preference for cash generation include hardware firms such as ibm and hp the share prices of which have risen since November These had free-cashflow yields of 10% and 12% respectivelyfar above the 3% yield for tech firms worldwide The parts of the sector that will suffer are those where cash generation has long been a problem Ride-hailing is a prime example The share prices of Uber and Lyft two American firms and Grab based in South-East Asia are all down by 40-60% so far this year Uber which recorded negative free cashflow on average between 2019 and 2021 is very much a hare by our classification Last month Dara Khosrowshahi its chief executive told employees that the company would now focus explicitly on generating positive cashflow There are other areas where the renewed attention to cash could pose a problem for tech firms in particular The prevalence of stock-based compensation is one Paying employees in stock options does not register in cashflow reporting in the way that conventional pay would because it is a non-cash expense Research published last year by Morgan Stanley a bank notes that the median stock-based payout of tech firms in the Russell 1000 runs to around 25% of cashflow before capital investment more than three times the level for any other sector The same analysis finds that Amazon free cashflow would have been reduced by almost one-third in 2020 if stock-based compensation had been counted as cashflow These sorts of divergences may prompt investors to try ever harder to paint a more accurate picture of cash generation With inflation running high and no immediate return to the era of easy money in prospect cash could start to rule everything around techRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The return of the inventory cycle Jun 2ndIs China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 6th 2022,Could seizing Russian assets help rebuild Ukraine?,In 2011 viktor vekselberg a metals tycoon and Kremlin insider visited the team designing the Tango a $90m yacht he had ordered to oversee its construction His attention to detail proved his undoing When Mr Vekselberg came under American sanctions in 2018 his foreign assets were frozenbut not the Tango which was held via a shell company registered in the British Virgin Islands Then two engineers at the shipyard remembering the meeting in 2011 tipped off the fbi A trail of money transfers confirmed that Mr Vekselberg did indeed own the Tango On April 4th this year Spanish police acting at America request seized the boat in MallorcaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNetting the Tango was a coup for KleptoCapture a task force set up by Joe Biden America president to track the assets of oligarchs blacklisted by the West after Russia invaded Ukraine The eu has captured about $7bn in art boats and property; Italy has impounded a $700m superyacht said to be linked to Vladimir Putin; America has held about $1bn in vessels and aircraft Add in the chunk of the Russian central bank currency reserves that have come under Western sanctions and nearly $400bn in assets have been blocked According to the Kyiv School of Economics the total economic damage to Ukraine so far could amount to as much as $600bn To many therefore the idea of seizing Russian assets selling them and using the proceeds to compensate the victims of Mr Putin aggression seems irresistible Charles Michel the head of the European Council for instance has argued that “it is extremely important not only to freeze assets but also to make it possible to confiscate them to make them available for rebuilding Ukraine” The idea has gained support from politicians everywhere from Canada to Germany But there are two big obstacles to the plan: the practical difficulties of freezing assets and the legal difficulties of seizing themConsider the practicalities of freezing assets first The central bank currency reserves are a relatively straightforward target More than half of Russia reserves are held in the West and are subject to sanctions So far however this giant stash is “hindered” not technically frozen: transactions with the central bank are prohibited but its funds are not legally blocked That means Western countries are an extra step away from being able to seize the money says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn a law firm Ukraine allies could decide to take that step as America did when it froze the Afghan central bank reserves last year after the Taliban entered KabulPrivate assets are harder to target Russia stock of foreign direct investment amounts to some $500bn But little of this is subject to freezes says Rachel Ziemba of cnas an American think-tank One problem is that it is hard to know where the investment is based: its recorded location is often Cyprus but that tends to be only an intermediate stop Freezes have therefore focused on individuals instead Here too tracking down assets is tricky Anders Aslund a former adviser to the Russian and Ukrainian governments estimates that Russians under sanctions hold some $400bn of assets abroad But he says only $50bn of that is frozen Having been targeted by sanctions after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 the wiliest oligarchs now hide their foreign assets behind 20-30 layers of shell companies Some physical assets have been moved to friendlier territory More than 100 Russian private jets landed in Dubai in the weeks after the invasion of Ukraine Moreover the enforcement of sanctions falls on the private firmsfrom banks to marinasthat serve the rich Not all have the expertise to see through tycoons’ obfuscation Whoever freezes the assets may also have to look after them which drains resources Houses need to be tended to; yachts cost 10% of their value in yearly maintenance These difficulties pale into insignificance when compared with the problems of confiscationthe next step if Russian assets are to be used to rebuild Ukraine In Western democracies seizing foreign property on the basis of nationality or political opinion is illegal That is not to say there are no precedents for the expropriation of both state and private assets But they have taken place at extraordinary times and when certain strict criteria have been met Seize and desist When it comes to individuals the typical condition for confiscation is a criminal convictionnot just for any crime but those that are deemed to warrant seizure The forfeited assets must either be determined an instrument of the crime or linked to the proceeds from it Such things can take years and a lot of money to be proved in court And the hurdle is unlikely to disappear soon: a bill introduced in the us Senate in April that would have granted the president powers to confiscate oligarchs’ assets was soundly defeated after the American Civil Liberties Union warned it would probably be struck down in court Officials in the West are therefore instead working to lengthen the list of crimes that warrant seizure In April the Biden administration introduced a bill that would add sanction and export-controls evasion to the list of offences punishable by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act which was passed in 1970 to crack down on mobsters and allows for ill-gotten gains to be seized On May 25th the European Commission outlined plans to make it easier for member countries to confiscate assets belonging to individuals suspected of breaching sanctionsEach proposal faces a tough political battle Although most Republicans support bashing Russia few want to give Mr Biden a victory ahead of the mid-term elections in November The eu will have no power to tell member governments how to use the proceeds from the liquidated assets Some countries will be wary of confiscation: Germany may have to amend its constitution which guarantees private property; Cyprus and Malta which act as transit hubs for Russian money are unlikely to support seizuresThe confiscation of state assets meanwhile would require Western governments to designate Russia a hostile power or to call for regime change which they have shied away from doing so far As a rule the doctrine of “sovereign immunity” enshrined by a un convention protects foreign states from local prosecution But some laws most notably in America allow the government to seize foreign state assets without trial in certain cases One such law is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ieepa which provides legal backing for the current freezes It does not explicitly grant the president powers to “vest” assetsie to change who owns them But one exception added in 2001 allows for some vesting when America is engaged in “armed hostilities” with another country This was used by George W Bush to seize Iraqi assets after he invaded the country in 2003 Today however America is at pains to emphasise that its shipments of weapons to Ukraine do not equate to its being in armed conflict with Russia Saying otherwise could become “the actual reason for war” notes Antonia Tzinova of Holland & Knight another law firmSeizures can happen outside ieepa America executive branch has the authority to transfer control of certain foreign state assets when it changes what it considers to be the legitimate governmentas it did in 2019 when it confiscated Venezuelan assets after recognising Juan Guaidó as president But America has so far fallen short of calling for Mr Putin to go Under rare circumstances Congress can also lift the immunity of sovereign states allowing their assets to compensate claimants in a domestic trial One chunk of the frozen Afghan assets has been set aside while courts hear from the families of the victims of the September 11th attacks For this to apply to Russia though America would have to declare it a terrorist state The eu for its part is not even discussing the matter of sovereign assets points out Jan Dunin-Wasowicz of Hughes Hubbard & Reed a law firm Mentions of them are conspicuously absent from its proposals International courts do not appear to be a fruitful avenue either Neither Russia nor Ukraine have consented to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice save for a few narrow exceptions says Astrid Coracini of the University of Vienna A newly created body akin to a commission set up by the un in 1991 to seek reparations from Iraq after it invaded Kuwait would require Russia consentCreative ideas are therefore springing up One is to target the billions of dollars a day that Russia receives for its energy exports rather than its stock of assets In a meeting of the g7 countries in May America proposed levying a tariff on Russian oil the proceeds of which could then be sent to Ukraine But achieving agreement even within the eu will be a tall order Another scheme would funnel payments for Russian oil to escrow accounts at international banks as happened with Iranian crude in the 2010s The accumulated bounty worth around $100bn became available again to Iran after sanctions were lifted in 2016 This time the West could demand that some of the money be donated to Ukraine One insider suspects the idea is being considered in Washington Russia could however try to wind down its remaining oil sales to the West Enforcing the measure more widely meanwhile would require transgressors to be threatened with “secondary” sanctionssomething that the West has so far avoided All this suggests that attempts to seize Russian assets while the war rages will struggle to avoid one of three pitfalls Unless Western countries ditch the protections they offer to foreign individuals and states they risk spending many years in court If they do ditch them however the trust underpinning their economies and societies could be endangered More creative ideas meanwhile may invite Russian retaliation and anger the rest of the worldThat does not mean Russian treasure will remain untouchable for ever Most reparations tend to be agreed once war ends often as a condition for unfreezing foreign assets Mr Putin still seems far from considering peace But if he ever comes round to it letting some money go to Ukraine may be the price he has to pay for seeing some of his own assetsincluding maybe a multi-million-dollar superyachtreturn home Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter 
 Jun 5th 2022,Europe economy grapples with an acute energy shock,For the best part of a decade rock-bottom interest rates seemed like a fact of life in the euro zoneas did low inflation Now consumer prices are rising at an annual rate exceeding 8% well above the European Central Bank target of 2% Members of the bank governing council have signalled their intent to raise rates soon a message they were expected to reaffirm at a monetary-policy meeting on June 9th as we went to press But the ecb finds itself in a tricky position: of contending not only with surging prices which might warrant rapid rate rises but also gloomier growth prospects which might warrant patience Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe root cause of both developments is a severe energy-price crunch Prices of oil and natural gas had already been rising before Russia invasion of Ukraine; the war sent them soaring higher still These price rises have played a much bigger role in pushing up consumer-price inflation in Europe than in America where stimulus has also been a culprit Energy prices in the euro areawhich rose at a whopping annual rate of 39% in Mayare contributing about four percentage points to headline inflation compared with two in AmericaThe effects are starting to spill over to other prices “Core” inflation which excludes food and energy prices was higher in the euro zone in May than economists had expected German producer prices rose at a record clip of 335% in April compared with last year driven not just by energy but also energy-intensive goods such as concrete and chemicals The result is a big hit to firms’ costs and households’ purchasing power In how much danger does it put the euro area economy? One consequence of the energy shock is lower household incomes in real terms Wage growth has been picking up modestly across the zone but still trails behind inflation Some employers have made one-off payments to workers to compensate them for surging prices without incurring higher recurring wage costs Even then however annual pay growth in the Netherlands where the labour market is tight stood at just 28% in May In one sense this is good news for the ecb because it reduces the risk of a wage-price spiral But it may feed into lower consumption weakening the rest of the economy in turnA moderation in demand only adds to a heap of woes for the manufacturing sector where confidence is already in steep decline Supply disruptions as a result of China recent lockdowns and high energy prices are hurting businesses with Germany and eastern Europe looking most vulnerable to an industrial slowdown New orders for the zone manufacturers in May fell for the first time since June 2020 indicating weaker demand Export orders declined at their fastest pace in two years Economists are therefore pencilling in slower growth over the rest of the year But few expect an outright recession just yet That is because some parts of the economy confront the energy shock from a position of strength rather than weakness Many services firms are still reaping the rewards from the end of Omicron-related lockdowns Southern countries are benefiting the most given their reliance on tourism; in Spain arrivals of sun-seeking northerners almost reached pre-pandemic levels in April Overall business sentiment in services remains strong with many firms reporting a growing backlog of work Jobs are still plentiful too Across the bloc there were three vacancies for every 100 jobs in the first quarter of 2022 a high level by historical standards Firms’ hiring expectations are solid albeit slightly weaker since the start of the war in Ukraine More than one in four businesses in Europe say that a lack of staff is preventing them from producing moreA hoard of savings built up during lockdowns should also provide consumers with some cushion against the energy shock According to our calculations such “excess” savings in France and Germany amounted to a tenth of disposable incomes in the first quarter of 2022 see chart These buffers will blunt the impact of the energy shock But they will not offset it altogether Excess savings for a start are not evenly distributed Poorer people in rich countries and most households in poorer countries have precious little left In Slovakia for example the savings rate never rose much during the pandemic “Consumption weakness will come from lower-income households” says Jens Eisenschmidt of Morgan Stanley a bank Retail sales in real terms have moved sideways for monthsMany governments have put together spending programmes to shield households from high energy prices According to Bruegel a think-tank in Brussels Germany France and others are spending between 1% and 2% of gdp Not all of that is well-targeted however Much of it is going on relief for better-off households that do not need it; other measures have involved meddling with prices with some of the benefit going to energy suppliersEven if the euro area is spared a recession then the energy shock will be a drag on growth The ecb faces an unenviable dilemma With every increase in inflation on the back of food and energy prices the European economy is getting weaker For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 2nd 2022,China dilemma over a curious breed of financial firm,China local-government financiers have a complex identity Tasked with developing land and doing public works they act on behalf of and with approval from city and provincial authorities Yet at the same time they represent large companies known as local-government financing vehicles lgfvs which have the ability to raise billions of dollars from global investors The thousands of lgfvs around the country owed an estimated 53trn yuan $83trn equivalent to 52% of annual gdp in debts last year Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKConflicts of interest have naturally arisen for the bosses of these hybrid firms In some cases they have been caught giving chummy private companies lucrative stakes in government projects Others have used their official status to guarantee bank loans for friends In Sichuan province a government financier was recently found to have lent out state funds to private firms at rates as high as 20% a year In Hunan province a boss was caught charging companies that work with the government consulting and paperwork fees Such practices might fly in the private sectorbut not with anti-corruption investigatorsThe central government is taking new interest in such dodgy dealings More than 40 high-ranking officials at lgfvs have been put under investigation or detained since the start of the year The Ministry of Finance has warned provincial authorities about the risks associated with corruption in the quasi-state sector The renewed attention on graft at lgfvs betrays growing concerns about the role the companies play in generating economic growth along with the piles of debt they have amassed in the processlgfvs are a uniquely Chinese problem Invented in the 1990s to get round rules that banned local governments from raising debt the companies became one of the most important sources of economic growth over the past two decades as they carried out vast numbers of public projects Their status as non-government entities allowed them to borrow heavily from investors in China and abroad One of the oddities of lgfvs is that it is city and provincial authorities that are on the hook for those debts But lgfvs’ borrowings are not included in official government budgets making it hard to gauge riskThe latest scrutiny brings with it two complications For a start it comes at an awkward moment The economy has been hit hard by recent lockdowns to contain covid-19 In response China leaders have announced plans for infrastructure spending this year to help achieve a lofty gdp-growth target of 55% lgfvs would typically play a key role in funding and contracting much of the building activity across the country But the crackdown on corruption and other restrictions means that managers will be less likely to take risks Normally this would be considered a good thing This time however an unwillingness to take on new projects could come at the cost of precious gdp growth at a time when the Communist Party can ill afford itMoreover tighter oversight has had the unintended effect of exposing lgfvs to currency risk The firms must gain regulatory approval to issue bonds within China Greater scrutiny over their use of funds has led to onshore-debt issuance by lgfvs falling by 22% in the first four months of 2022 compared with the same period last year This has pushed the companies into the riskier offshore market: dollar-bond issuance by lgfvs soared by about 150% during the same period according to Pengyuan a rating agency But few of these companies earn dollar revenues making it harder to repay the bonds A default would send a shock wave through the bond market Such dangers explain why Beijing technocrats want to reduce the importance of lgfvs especially as local governments can now issue bonds directly reducing the need for fiddly workarounds For as long as the growth target is in peril though lgfvs will be going nowhere For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jun 2nd 2022,The return of the inventory cycle,Remember the Great Moderation? This refers to the period before the global financial crisis of 2007-09 during which there was a marked fall in the volatility of gdp growth in rich countries Explanations for it ranged from wiser monetary policy yes really to globalisation In fact much of it was down to something more mundane: smaller inventories One authoritative study found that more than half the improvement in the stability of rich-world growth was explained by diminished inventory cyclesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe classic stockbuilding cycle in which inventory changes add to the momentum of gdp on the way up through over-ordering and on the way down through stock clearances is showing signs of a revival Some big American retailers notably Walmart have reported large increases in stocks In part this is the result of errors in forecasting demand But it also reflects an increase in the desired level of inventories As just-in-time production gives way to just-in-case stockpiling the scope for greater volatility in gdp and in corporate earnings is increasingTo understand why inventories are rising again it helps first to understand why they fell Improvements in computing mean that firms have more detailed and timelier information about demand from consumers Such changes made large precautionary stockholdings redundant A related factor is carrying cost Interest rates were high in the 1980s when businesses first began to favour leaner inventories And a dollar in stock is a dollar that cannot be used profitably elsewhere Accompanying this was the widespread adoption of just-in-time manufacturing with its emphasis on flexible supplyFor the leanest companies inventory consists of whatever FedEx or ups is carrying for them Or it did until recently The tech-and-trade wars between America and China challenged assumptions about the security of supply The pandemic and now the war in Ukraine upset them completely The pattern of demand suddenly shifted as locked-down consumers could not spend on dining out or live entertainment; instead they spent more on goods that could be ordered online and delivered to their door Meanwhile shortages of workers and of key inputs notably semiconductors meant that some orders could not be fulfilled Businesses lost sales for want of inventory Logistical snafus became a board-level discussionThe result inevitably has been an overcorrection Having lagged behind spending inventories got ahead of it The share prices of Walmart and Target fell sharply in mid-May when the two retailers revealed they had been left with large stocks of unsold goods after misjudging the strength of demand Even the mighty Amazon has been blindsided as the e-commerce share of retail sales which exploded in the pandemic has fallen back towards its pre-covid trend The cyclical effects of all this will have to be reckoned with Some retailers may be holding the wrong stock for the time of year They will either have to store it mark down prices to clear it quickly or move it on to discount retailers that specialise in selling out-of-season stock Inflation will be lower than it would otherwise have been Some companies that have over-ordered will cut back on purchases to allow stock levels to adjust to the trend in spending Albert Edwards of Société Générale a French bank reckons that the pain will be felt more in China as “demand for Chinese imports gets hit hard just when the Chinese authorities are struggling to revive their moribund economy”Yet there is something more profound at play Just-in-time production assumes a largely frictionless worldof open borders predictable demand and low transport costs This can no longer be relied upon Inventory is a form of insurance against unexpected delays And though insurance is costly company bosses seem willing to pay for more of it The trade-off between efficiency and self-insurance between just-in-time and just-in-case has shifted markedly towards the latter And larger inventories imply greater scope for inventory cycles in the futureThere is a paradox here The more companies seek to self-insure by holding more stocks the more volatile gdp and thus corporate earnings is likely to become over time American retailing might thus be offering a preview of a particular futureof jumpier revenues and more frequent profit warnings The Great Moderation is going into reverse Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Is China “uninvestible”?

 Jun 2nd 2022,Should China spend more on infrastructure?,Rarely can so much have been used by so few During Shanghai long lockdown which mercifully eased this week the city impressive infrastructure stood in splendid isolation from most of the citizens it is meant to serve The metro all 831km of it was eerily quiet The two airports which handled 120m passengers in 2019 operated at 99% below their normal level The famous mag-lev train neither magnetised nor levitated Six-lane highways provided an ocean of road space for handfuls of scooters China is renowned for creating “ghost cities”: new sparsely populated districts that gradually come to life as people move into them Shanghai lockdown reversed this process turning a lively metropolis into something undead Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis surreal underuse of existing infrastructure notwithstanding the government best hope for reviving the economy is to add more of it Much more Spending on transport water conservation and renovating old neighbourhoods will be a “strong driving force” for the economy helping to employ China 290m migrant workers said Li Keqiang the prime minister in an emergency teleconference with thousands of local officials on May 25th The government will also “vigorously” promote 102 “major projects” listed in the country five-year plan such as flood prevention ultra-high-voltage power lines and four-lane expresswaysincluding one to a city in Yunnan renamed Shangri-LaIf Omicron resurges recurring lockdowns may prevent China spending its way out of trouble this year But even if everything goes to plan a successful stimulus will raise a deeper question Does China need all that additional infrastructure? Or will the extra spending leave behind superfluous “white elephants” as undisturbed by human traffic as the airports roads and railways of locked-down Shanghai?The question is tricky to answer because infrastructure in China is hard to measure or even define The definition used by the National Bureau of Statistics nbs often leaves out areas such as gas and electricity as well as social sectors like education and health care Worse the official investment figures designed with central planners in mind are not consistent with modern national accounting Nor owing to shifts in classification and reporting thresholds are they consistent with themselves over time As Carsten Holz of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology once noted if one intended to make this data “as unusable as possible one could probably not do a better job than the nbs does”In a paper published by the World Bank in 2020 Richard Herd nonetheless estimates that China stock of infrastructure and government capital rose from 64% of gdp on the eve of the global financial crisis in 2007 to 107% in 2016 the most recent figure in his paper This new prominence of infrastructure and housing in Chinese investment may help explain the country productivity slowdown over the past decade Another measure by the imf adds up all the investment undertaken by China central and local governments According to this method the stock of public capital was even larger: 151% of gdp in 2019 among the highest shares in the world Both of these measures compare the scale of China infrastructure with the size of its gdp This convention makes some sense: a bigger economy needs a larger backbone to support it Conversely a small economy where people are few in number or limited in their means can fit into a smaller infrastructural frame If few people can afford cars flights or smartphones a country will have less need of roads airports and 5g towers According to this logic infrastructure is a kind of “input” that should be sized according to the scale of production But gdp is not the only relevant comparison Indeed saying that a country infrastructure should be kept in proportion to its gdp is tantamount to saying that poor countries should have poor infrastructure Some common components of infrastructure are more like amenities than inputs to production A cleaner environment a faster bus trip or a more comfortable train journey are things people of all income levels can appreciate On this view what matters is the amount of infrastructure per person regardless of their incomeSadly China infrastructure is less impressive when compared with the size of its vast population For example it has 120km of motorways per 1m people compared with 179km in France and 326km in America And it has 106km of railway per 1m people compared with 236km in Britain and over 400km in Germany China metro lines are more than 20 times as long as those in France But China population living in cities of over 500000 people is also more than 20 times as large China also has only 44 intensive-care beds for every 100000 people according to some estimates compared with 14 in Americaa catastrophic shortage of medical infrastructure that helps explain its lack of tolerance for covid outbreaks Indeed there are 37 economies in the imf database that have a higher stock of public capital per person than China Presumably those economies do not think that their extra infrastructure is entirely superfluous The longer road to Shangri-LaCritics of China proposed infrastructure stimulus worry that it will crowd out other more productive forms of spending But in China covid-wracked economy other spending is unusually weak Without government help the level of demand might not be enough to fully employ the country labour and capital including its existing infrastructure A recession can impose the same kind of compulsory idleness on an economy as a lockdown The time and energy that China workers will devote to extending power networks waterways and roads to Shangri-La might otherwise be lost to the economy for ever Wasteful spending is a curse in China But underspending can be the most elephantine waste of all Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How economic interdependence fosters alliances and democracy May 28thHow to unleash more investment in intangible assets May 21stThe world needs a new economic motor Could India fit the bill?

 Jun 1st 2022,What America next recession will look like,These days it is hard to turn a corner without bumping into predictions of an American recession Big banks prominent economists and former officials are all saying that a downturn is a near certainty as the Federal Reserve wrestles inflation under control Three-quarters of chief executives of Fortune 500 companies are braced for growth to go negative before the end of 2023 Bond yields and consumer surveys are flashing red Google searches for “recession” are soaring Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe track record is certainly ominous As Larry Summers a former treasury secretary has observed whenever inflation has risen above 4% and unemployment has dipped below 4%two thresholds that when breached indicate economic overheatingAmerica has suffered a recession within two years It is well across both thresholds now For much of last year the Fed and investors alike believed that inflation would fade as the pandemic subsided No one believes that now There is broad agreement that supply snarls and energy-price surges notwithstanding demand is also excessive and that tighter monetary policy is needed to return it to a normal level The question is how tight and therefore how much the economy could suffer: the higher the Fed has to raise rates the more punishing the downturn will be Investors are pricing in pain as indicated by the fall in stocks since the start of the yearIf America does slip into a recession how might it play out? One way of trying to divine the path of a downturn is to consult history America has suffered 12 recessions since 1945 Many observers point to similarities between today predicament and the early 1980s when Paul Volcker Fed crushed inflation causing a deep recession in the process Others look at the downturn that followed the energy crises of the 1970s echoed by the surge in oil and food prices today Still others point to the dotcom bust in 2000 mirrored by the collapse in tech stocks this yearBut these parallels have serious flaws Inflation is nowhere near as entrenched as at the start of Mr Volcker era Growth is far less energy-intensive than in the 1970s And the economy faces more complex crosswinds now than it did after the bust of 2000 The unusual nature of the deep covid-induced downturn in 2020 and the roaring recovery in 2021 when fiscal and monetary stimulus flooded the economy limits the relevance of past episodesA better way to think about a recession if it comes is to look at America as it is today Consider three different facets: the real economy the financial system and the central bank All three working in concert suggest that a recession would be relatively mild Households and businesses’ balance-sheets are mostly strong Risks in the financial system appear to be manageable The Fed for its part has been too slow to respond to inflation but the credibility it has built up over the past few decades means it can still fight an effective rearguard action There is however a sting in the tail: when the recession ultimately ends the consequences of the past few years of living dangerously with inflation may make for a sluggish recoveryStart with the resilience of the real economy which may well be the most important line of defence in a downturn The general population is on a sound financial footing a welcome change from the overextended consumers of the past Household debt is about 75% of gdp down from 100% on the eve of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 Even more striking is how much less Americans pay annually to service their debts Because so many have shifted to cheaper mortgages as interest rates have fallen in recent years their annual debt payments now add up to about 9% of disposable income about the lowest since data were first collected in 1980Moreover many households have larger-than-normal cash buffers thanks to the stimulus payments of the past two years plus their reduced spending on travel restaurants and the like at the height of the pandemic Overall Americans have excess savings of about $2trn 9% of gdp compared with before covid They have started to use some of this cash as living costs rise but still retain a useful cushionIn any recession one big concern is how many people will lose their jobs Unemployment tends to rise during recessions: in the median post-1945 downturn in America excluding the brief covid recession the peak jobless rate rose by nearly three percentage points see chart 1 A rise in unemployment seems more economically necessary today as a way to relieve some of the upward pressure on wages and dampen inflation Could things play out differently though? The labour market has by some measures never been so tight: a record 19 jobs are available for every unemployed person This has fuelled optimism that companies could in effect cancel their job ads without firing people Jerome Powell chairman of the Fed has expressed this hope “There a path by which we would be able to moderate demand in the labour market and have vacancies go down without having unemployment going up” he said on May 4th Hurting me softlyIn practice though the labour market is unlikely to adjust so smoothly Mr Summers has drawn attention to the concept of the Beveridge curve which portrays a basic relationship: the more vacancies there are the lower the unemployment rate Since the onset of the pandemic the curve has shifted outwards see chart 2 In other words it now seems to require more vacancies to get to the same unemployment rates as in the pastan indication of faltering efficiency in the economy ability to match the right people with the right jobs One possible explanation is that some people are still reluctant to work because of the health risks from covid Another is regional variation: some states like Utah and Nebraska have giant needs for workers but not enough people are willing to move to themWhatever the precise reason the implication is that it is too optimistic to think that the Fed tightening can reduce vacancies without also reducing employment Yet that does not mean that Mr Powell is all wrong The Beveridge curve could also move back as the recovery progresses and more people re-enter the workforce Say the unemployment rate increases by two percentage points instead of the nearly three points in the median recession That would take the rate to about 55% lower than the average of the past three decades Though painful for those who end up on the dole it would be a good outcome as far as recessions go By contrast 11% of Americans were out of work by the time Mr Volcker had finished tightening Even if most people are fairly well insulated from a recession they are still likely to curtail their spending as the economy goes south Belt-tightening would in turn translate into less revenue for businesses A key question is how those lower earnings will interact with high debt levels: unlike households companies have ramped up their borrowing over the past decade Non-financial business debt stands at about 75% of gdp not far from a record highReassuringly many companies sought to lock in rock-bottom rates during the pandemic In 2021 companies reduced debt coming due this year by about 27% or $250bn mainly by refinancing their existing debt at lower rates and for longer durations That makes them less sensitive to an increase in interest ratesLess reassuringly riskier companies also took advantage of easy money Bonds that are rated bbb the lowest rung of investment-grade debt now account for a record 57% of the investment-grade bond market up from 40% in 2007 When a recession strikes the ratings on many of these bonds could slip a notch or two And when bonds go from investment-grade to speculative or junk status they become far less appealing for a universe of investors such as pension funds and insurance firms That increases the chances of a flight to safety when the mood sours Even so thanks to the starting point of low funding costs there are limits to how bad things might get In a pessimistic scenariowhere a recession collides with higher input costs and rising interest ratess&p a rating agency forecasts that about 6% of speculative-grade corporate bonds will go into default next year That would be well up from the 15% rate now but half the 12% rate in 2009 Intriguingly the sector today holding the most low-quality debt is media and entertainment featuring many leisure companies such as cruise lines A recession would sap demand for their services But as worries about covid recede there is also a pent-up desire to get out and have fun again The paradoxical result is that a swathe of low-rated companies may be positioned to fare better than most during a downturnHow well fortified is the financial system America second facet? Headlines in recent years about Basel 3 capital standards for banks may have caused more than a few pairs of eyes to glaze over But these rules have served a purpose forcing large financial firms to hold more capital and more liquid assets Banks went into 2007 with core loss-absorbing equity worth about 8% of their risk-weighted assets Today it is more like 13% a much plumper margin of safety “A recession would not look like it did after the financial crisis The system is just not levered like it was back then” says Jay Bryson of Wells Fargo a bankNew threats have inevitably emerged Prudential regulations have pushed risky activities into darker corners of the financial system Non-bank lenders for instance issued about 70% of all mortgages last year up from 30% a decade ago Ideally that would spread risks away from banks But bank lending to these non-banks has also boomed creating a web of opaque linkages Insurers hedge funds and family officesin effect investment firms for the ultra-richhave also taken on additional risks They carry more debt than 15 years ago and are among the biggest investors in lower-rated corporate bondsEmblematic of the new kind of danger are collateralised loan obligations clos These are typically created by syndicating loans pooling them and then dividing them into securities with different ratings depending on their payment profiles The value of outstanding clos has reached about $850bn making it the biggest securitised credit market in America And high-risk leveraged loans form a growing share of clos which are partly converted into investment-grade assets through the alchemy of securitisation The parallels with the dodgy mortgage-backed securities of the financial crisis are obvious Yet the similarities can also be overstated The clo market is about half the size of the riskiest mortgage-securities market in the early 2000s clos connect investors to a wide range of industries not just property They also tend to be longer-term investments more resistant to market ups and downsMoreover an important stabiliser for the financial system will be the relative solidity of America most important asset market: property An exuberant surge in house prices over the past two years means a decline in sales and values may be on the cards But property is also dramatically undersupplied Sam Khater of Freddie Mac a government-backed mortgage firm estimates that America has a shortage of nearly 4m homes because of a slowdown in building over the past 15 years It is far better for the financial system to enter a recession with a giant underinvestment backlog than with an overinvestment hangover as was the case in 2007The final factor in assessing the impact of a recession is monetary policy As of March the median forecast by members of the Fed rate-setting committee was that inflation would fall to close to 2% in 2024 without interest rates having to exceed 3% It seems a fair bet that rates will go quite a bit higher James Bullard the relatively hawkish president of the St Louis Fed reckons that the central bank will need to increase rates to 35% by the end of this year A simple rule of thumb which combines the Fed desired real rate of interest and expected inflation suggests even higher nominal rates may be needed If the real neutral rate which neither stimulates nor restrains growth is 05% then the Fed would probably want to hit a real rate of about 15% to rein in inflation Add on short-term inflation expectations of 4% per year as indicated by consumer surveys at present and that suggests that the Fed may need to lift its nominal rate to 55% “There is a substantially greater probability that we’ll need higher rates than the Fed now envisions or the market now predicts” says Mr SummersPut differently the Fed is embarking on a journey with a clear destination low inflation an obvious vehicle interest rates but hazy guesses about how to get there how high rates must go It will know the correct path only by moving forward and seeing how the economy reacts It has barely taken its first steps raising rates by three-quarters of a percentage point over the past three months and setting out a plan for shrinking its assets But it may be pleased with the results so far clearly visible as financial markets rush to price in future tighteningFor all the Fed missteps of the past year investors still have respect for it a precious legacy of the past four decades starting with Mr Volcker leadership in which it kept a lid on inflation Equities which were looking bubbly have tumbled in value The impact on mortgages has been dramatic: 30-year fixed rates have risen above 5% the highest in more than a decade Yet credit spreads have widened only somewhat an indication that lending markets are not too stressed Taken together this looks like an orderly sell-off and an early success for the Fed Although inflation expectations as measured by bond pricing still point to annual inflation of 3% over the next five years they have come down by about half a percentage point since MarchMr Bullard case for optimism is that much of the work of taming inflation can be done by resetting expectations at a lower level The real economy would then not need to bear the weight of the adjustment The key objective for the Fed is therefore to prove to investors that its vows to quash inflation are credible “It is more game theory and less econometrics” he says The Fed record over the past couple of months since belatedly training its sights on inflation opens up the possibility that it may be able to tame prices without a punishingly high increase in rates That in turn would make for a lighter recessionWhy worry then? For one thing even a mild recession hurts Imagine the unemployment rate does rise by two percentage points as in our relatively hopeful scenario That would imply job losses for about 3m Americans The political consequences may be even more dramatic The recession in 1990 shows up as a mere blip in economic trends but it helped pave the way for Bill Clinton victory over George HW Bush A mild recession in 2023 could put paid to Joe Biden beleaguered presidency perhaps helping usher Donald Trump back into the White HouseThis will make the policy response to a looming recession much more controversial If as expected the Republicans seize control of Congress from the Democrats in mid-term elections this November there would be little chance of a muscular fiscal stimulus as growth slows Republicans would see little reason to bail out Mr Biden especially if the financial system holds upThe task of easing would fall squarely on the Fed But having just fought to contain an overheating economy and bring inflation to heel the central bank would be queasy about revving up demand too much And if the current cycle of rate increases stops at a low level the Fed would not have much room to cut rates anyway The next step would be once again to unleash quantitative easing ie purchasing assets such as government bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates It would however be fearful of the optics of “printing money” so soon after whipping inflation and just as a contentious election campaign gets under wayThe upshot is that policymakers are likely to have a limited arsenal if the next recession is just round the corner Given the strengths of the economy todayflush consumers solid businesses and safe banksthe next downturn ought to be mild But even a mild recession must be followed by an upturn for the economy to return to full health And with fiscal policy on the sidelines and monetary policy badly hobbled the chances are that America would face a painfully slow recovery After two years of focusing on high inflation low growth may move back to centre-stage as the economy principal problem For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 31st 2022,Why the oil price is spiking again,In the 1970s Arab states used the “oil weapon” of embargoes to punish Western governments for supporting Israel On May 30th the heads of the 27 eu member governments agreed to turn the weapon on themselves as part of a fresh round of sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine As well as cutting off Sberbank Russia largest bank from the swift cross-border payment system the package will also ban purchases of Russian crude oil and refined products such as diesel by the end of the year There would the eu said be a “temporary” exemption for oil delivered through pipelines The price of a barrel of Brent crude leapt above $120 on the news its highest level since MarchListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn principle the decision is highly significant As well as demonstrating unity and the bloc willingness to bear economic pain to punish Russia it cuts one of the few remaining trade ties with the Kremlin It also imperils one of Russia most lucrative sources of foreign-currency earnings The eu is Russia biggest market for crude buying about half the country oil exports There are reasons however to be sceptical that the move will deprive the Kremlin of much foreign currency For a start the ban applies only to seaborne oil transported via tankers That is the price of unity: excluding oil delivered by pipelines was necessary to find a compromise with Hungary which is both more sympathetic to Russia than most eu countries and critically dependent on the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline a name meaning “friendship” in Russian Hungary imports about 65% of its crude from RussiaSeaborne oil makes up a similar share of Europe imports from Russia But the ban is likely to have a limited impact on the oil market Many tankers are already subject to “self-sanctioning” in parts of the West Dockworkers have refused to unload ships carrying Russian cargoes and oil majors have been worried about the hit to their reputations from accepting shipments Western financiers are stepping back from writing insurance contracts Insurers based in Russia allies could partly replace them but have shallower pockets A big question is whether Russian seaborne crude once placed under sanctions will go unsold So far Russia oil exports have risen even as the country has come under sanctions According to analysts at JPMorgan Chase a bank much of the increase has gone to India which has not issued sanctions of its own Another question is whether Europe does eventually ban piped Russian oil which is harder to redirect to other countries Poland and Germany have said they will cease importing via the Druzhba pipeline Yet it is hard to imagine Hungary dropping its opposition to a wider ban Viktor Orban the country populist prime minister has demonstrated his willingness to block eu decisions before Thanks to a hefty discount on Russian crudethe Urals benchmark is trading significantly below Brentmol a Hungarian oil group reports “skyrocketing” marginsPartial though the embargo may be such is the tightness of the oil market that prices still surged Demand for fuel is strong as the pandemic subsides and consumers start driving and flying again and as governments try to shield voters from the impact of higher energy costs China easing of coronavirus restrictions in recent days has also added to the thirst for oil The prices of industrial metals including iron ore and copper have rallied too Meanwhile the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries opec and its allies which include Russia have shown little sign of increasing production just yet The group was due to meet on June 2nd as we went to press and was not expected to depart from its plan to gradually increase supply to levels seen before the pandemic although prices dipped on reports that it was mulling a plan to exclude Russia from its production targets allowing Saudi Arabia and others to pump more to make up for any lost output Tight supply and robust demand together translate into higher prices for consumers at the pump To make matters worse a shortage of refinery capacity in America has raised prices for petrol and diesel even further than the cost of crude The surging dollar adds to costs for Europe and emerging markets notes Francisco Blanch of Bank of America None of this is welcome news in an already inflationary environment According to figures published on May 31st inflation in the euro area rose to 81% in the year to May higher than economists had expectedThe Arab embargoes of the 1970s caused short-term pain for the West but also spurred a drive for fuel efficiency that ultimately reduced its reliance on oil European governments today may find themselves hoping that the short-term pain for consumers similarly gives way to the long-term gain of energy security Read more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisisFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

 May 29th 2022,The changing American consumer,Asked recently about Amazon sprawling network of warehouses Brian Olsavsky the firm finance chief did not mince words “We have too much space right now” As consumer demand surged during the pandemic the online retailer doubled its capacity from 193m square feet 18m square metres at the end of 2019 to 387m square feet two years later Today it has a glut which the company says is costing it tens of millions of dollars a day Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRetailers are bracing themselves for a slowdown as central banks raise interest rates But Amazon troubles reflect another crucial development for the global economy: a shift in spending from goods back to services reversing a pandemic-era trend This switch should ease pressure on global supply chains and lower inflation But it has been slow and uneven Confined to their homes during the worst of the pandemic consumers in the rich world splurged on appliances cars and furniture The binge was most notable in America where it was fuelled by three rounds of “stimmy” cheques People bought substitutes for the services they could no longer enjoyan exercise bike say to make up for closed gyms Perhaps as a result of having a little extra cash they also treated themselves to things like watches and luxury products A year into the pandemic the composition of consumer spending had changed dramatically By spring 2021 goods accounted for 42% of household spending in America up from 36% before the pandemic; services accounted for 58% down from 64% a drop worth more than $900bn per year Several other Western countries experienced a similar rise in goods consumption though few witnessed a bigger boost than America Daan Struyven and Dan Milo of Goldman Sachs a bank compare the evolution of goods spending in real terms across 23 oecd countries America outperformed all but two The latest data from the oecd suggest that the Nordic countries also splurged On average though they spent about 5% more on goods in 2021 than pre-pandemic trends would have suggested compared with 10% in America The spending spree where it occurred helped lift economies out of recession But it also contributed to an inflation headache A deluge of new orders overwhelmed global supply chains which were already strained by pandemic-related disruptions leading to clogged ports and shipping delays With demand outstripping supply goods prices rose America Bureau of Labour Statistics reckons that goods prices boosted consumer-price inflation by 49 percentage points in the year to April 2022 having reduced it by 01 points in the 12 months before the pandemic Now spending is starting to shift in the other direction Data published on May 27th showed that spending on goods fell in the year to April and is now 9% above its pre-pandemic trend down from a high of 16% last year Spending on services is up by 7% in the same period and is just 3% below pre-pandemic trends But some services have been quicker to recover than others Messrs Struyven and Milo of Goldman Sachs note that while “fun” spending categories with pent-up demand such as food services air travel and hotels have rebounded over the past year others have lagged behind Services that cater to white-collar professionals have been slow to recover Spending on public transport is about 24% below where it would have been without the pandemic; laundry and dry-cleaning revenues meanwhile are 20% below trend Even some essential services have been slow to recover Spending on doctors’ and dentists’ services is about 15% below trend; child care is down by 22% Appetite for many non-essential goods by contrast shows little sign of abating Spending on jewellery and recreational vehicles is 53% and 43% above trend respectively Spending on pets is up by 23%One question is whether the composition of consumer spending will return to pre-pandemic norms The hope is that this eases bottlenecks and helps bring down inflation Yet several uncertainties lie ahead The process looks likely to be slow If recent trends in America continue goods and services spending will not return to pre-pandemic levels until perhaps the third quarter of next year And some habits could stick: the rise of remote working say may have permanently changed the consumption mix keeping the relative demand for goods higher than it was before the pandemic Hovering over all this is a potentially souring economic backdrop as people become gloomier about their finances Consumers especially those in America powered an extraordinary goods boom over the past couple of years What they do next is much less certain For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 26th 2022,Carbon markets are going global,Carbon markets for years short of puff have at last become one of the most widespread tools in the fight against climate change By the end of 2021 more than 21% of the world emissions were covered by some form of carbon pricing up from 15% in 2020 Ever more businesses have to pay regulators for the right to release a tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere Investors are getting interested too: trading on these markets grew by 164% last year to €760bn $897bnListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat is undoubtedly great news Carbon prices ensure companies that burn more fossil fuels are at a competitive disadvantage while green innovation is rewarded The revenue from the sale of carbon permits meanwhile can be reinvested in renewable energy or other virtuous ventures as governments see fitThe problem is that very few markets work as intended Of the 64 carbon taxes and emissions-trading systems etss that existed in 2021 only a tiny minority covering 38% of emissions priced the gas above $40 a tonne which the Carbon Price Leadership Coalition a group of businesses and governments estimates as the minimum social cost of carbon a measure of the damage done to global welfare by increasing emissions And that may be too generous already: some economists put it at more than $200 Many carbon markets are too cheap to make a differenceMost schemes operate on the principle of “cap and trade” Regulators set a total level of permitted annual emissionsthe capand auction these allowances to the companies included in the scheme Businesses can then trade the allowances between themselves putting a price on carbon dioxide Some etss also allow financial firms such as hedge funds to trade purely for profit on their own accountThe best markets put a high price on carbon thanks to a low cap that goes lower over time providing a strong incentive to go green They also cover a broad spectrum of economic activity allowing agents to trade off between burning petrol in cars coal in blast furnaces or natural gas in power plants The wide scope ensures that trading systems find the cheapest way of reducing emissions lowering the overall cost to society of fighting climate changeMany schemes however fall short on both counts The reason is obvious: a well-functioning ets demands political courage Like taxes carbon markets transfer resources from the private sector to the state which irks those standing for small government Higher carbon prices can also help to push up consumer prices angering voters while hurting the margins of firms that donate to political parties How ambitious carbon markets are is “an expression of political will” says Dallas Burtraw who chairs the independent committee overseeing California trading scheme All too often that will is missingChanging political winds have sometimes dealt a fatal blow to fledgling carbon markets Australia for example junked its own scheme in 2014 after the centre-right Liberal party made repealing the “carbon tax” a plank of its election campaign More often political heat leads governments to do all they can to keep prices low see chart On May 18th the European Commission pressed by member states worried about soaring energy prices said it would sell an extra 200m permits there are currently 145bn in circulation Carbon prices on the eu scheme the world second-biggest promptly fell from €90 $97 a tonne to around €80 Other schemes have been flooded with permits from the start China ets launched last year is the world biggest But with a price nearing 60 yuan $9 it does little to reduce emissions says Yan Qin of Refinitiv a data firmThe second problem is that swathes of the economy are often excluded Industrial firms argue that including them in a robust ets gives an unfair advantage to exporters from countries with a lower carbon price which is why the eu and others offer home-grown champions a certain amount of permits for free Although meant to prevent “carbon leakage” where steel firms say relocate from areas with strict emissions rules to those with looser standards such perks make schemes less effectiveConsumers too are often shielded from high carbon prices Transport and buildings where higher costs would be passed on to voters directly are excluded from the eu scheme Others do better: the Californian system the most comprehensive of the bigger etss covers 80% of the state emissions Proceeds from the sales of carbon permits are partly used to subsidise purchases of electric carsOther markets are even more limited in scope The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative rggi backed by 11 north-eastern American states only covers power generation So does China national system given the size of the Chinese economy it still covers 74% of global emissions Sometimes it is the way emissions are counted that is the problem China does not put a cap on the total amount of emissions which can still rise along with electricity demand but on the carbon intensity of power generation Its ets is also bedevilled by poor data collectionMaking carbon markets work better is more of a political challenge than an economic one Neither lowering caps on total emissions nor covering more sectors requires a deep rethink of carbon markets’ designs The difficulty rather is building and preserving support for measures that make most economic activities costlier The same applies to other climate-friendly measures notes Ben Caldecott of Oxford University: Britain has long failed to raise petrol taxes in line with inflation costing the government billions Cheeringly however the momentum around carbon markets looks self-sustaining The eu is considering what it calls a “carbon border-adjustment mechanism” which would see importers into the bloc pay the difference between the relevant foreign carbon price and the eu Not only would that remove the justification for free allowances for manufacturing firms inside Europe; it would also encourage countries that want to export to the bloc to bring their carbon prices closer to the euCreating bigger markets by linking two or more etss can also help plug carbon leaks That is of course justifiable on scientific grounds: a tonne of carbon is as harmful in one country as it is in any other It also makes carbon markets more liquid which helps form truer prices Accordingly regional patchworks have emerged California ets has been linked with Quebec since 2014 Switzerland ets merged with the eu in 2020 Pennsylvania will become the 12th state to join the rggi in July And although Britain chose to run a separate ets after leaving the eu rejoining the regional scheme should be rather painless As more of the world economy is covered by etss and carbon border taxes gain favour it will be laggards rather than early adopters that risk becoming uncompetitive That threat seems to be working After resisting for years Japan is set to try out a national carbon market in September Some American lawmakers are also starting to look again at carbon pricing if only because their country tends to be greener than many of its trade partners and carbon border taxes could be a handy excuse for protectionist measures The key to building support for decarbonisation says Mr Burtraw is to “create winners” In a country where China-bashing tends to be more popular than environmentalism it will do no harm to the cause if points can be scored at the expense of an arch-rival For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly

 May 26th 2022,The credit market hasn’t cracked yet,At their best capital markets hold up a mirror to the real economy They rise and fall in tandem with companies’ fortunes encouraging investors to direct money towards the firms most likely to make a return on it But the arrow of causality can also fly the other way A dysfunctional market can choke off the supply of capital even to healthy firms forcing them into default for no better reason than that financial conditions have tightenedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe worst instances of this occur when the credit market comes unstuck as it did in the financial crisis of 2007-09 That adds an ominous ring to the unusually sharp losses credit investors have endured recently Based on total returns American investment-grade bonds are down by 14% since September European ones have dropped by around 10% their worst peak-to-trough plunge The credit spread or premium paid by risky “high-yield” borrowers compared to Treasuries has spiked from three percentage points in late December to nearly five with around half that increase coming in May Firms from Carvana an American car retailer to Morrisons a British supermarket chain have struggled to issue debt Is it time to panic?To understand why not start with credit spreads Those for American high-yield bonds began 2022 close to all-time lows Even after their recent rise they remain below their long-run average and far from the levels seen in 2008 and during the covid convulsion in 2020 see chart Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics a consultancy says the tightening is more reminiscent of the growth scares of 2015-16 and 2018 than of a credit crunchA tsunami of corporate defaults remains unlikely Few of the riskiest borrowers have to repay their debt in the next 18 months Of America $15trn-worth of high-yield bonds just 45% falls due before 2024; the figure is 64% in the euro zone Most issuers need only worry about earning enough to meet their interest payments rather than finding new lenders to roll over their debt Moody a rating agency reckons the global default rate will hit 3% over the 12 months to April 2023higher than the 19% for the year to April 2022 but below the historical average of 41%Those firms that do need to refinance are likely to find a receptive market A monthly survey by America National Association of Credit Managers found financial conditions in April to be slightly tighter than in late 2021 but looser than at any time before that going back to 2004 As the Federal Reserve starts winding down its $58trn portfolio of Treasuries from June 1st some liquidity is likely to drain from the market For now however cases like Carvana and Morrisons look like outliersTwo risks remain One is that corporate profits disappoint so much that borrowers are unable to pay even their interest The bigger one is that risk-averse investors perhaps spooked by fears of a recession pull their money from bond funds en masse and hoard cash instead That would leave such funds with less to lend to new issuers Worse still they may be forced to fire-sell existing debt to fund redemptionsShould that happen the experiences of Carvana and Morrisons point to a safety valve Ultimately both firms managed to issue their debt by turning to private lenders and offering sweetened terms Between 2008 and 2021 the assets managed by such lenders tripled to $12trn Unlike traditional bond funds they don’t offer investors daily withdrawals meaning they are less susceptible to swings in sentiment and more able to deploy capital when the market is stressed They are sitting on more than $420bn of “dry powder” or unspent cash Daniel Lamy of JPMorgan Chase a bank does not expect them to hold fire for very much longer For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 25th 2022,How economic interdependence fosters alliances and democracy,On his whirlwind tour of Asia concluded on May 24th President Joe Biden conducted himself with the awkward urgency of a man trying to correct a costly error China may be reeling but the ambivalent reaction outside rich democracies to America late search for solidarity reveals how Washington global influence has faded relative to Beijing Mr Biden proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework unveiled on May 23rd seems an acknowledgment of why that is: for too long America had all but abandoned efforts to forge new economic ties in the regionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEstablishing a causal link between economic interdependence and the balance of geopolitical power is no simple matter however That economies often trade more with countries that share similar political values and interests is clear enough Yet it could be the case that strategic concerns tend to drive economic relationships not the other way around or that other shared featuressuch as income levels or culturebring countries closer in both economic and political terms Two recent papers help to pick apart what causes what A first by Benny Kleinman Ernest Liu and Stephen Redding of Princeton University considers whether economic interdependence fosters greater political alignment To answer the question the authors build a model in which countries sometimes take costly actions such as providing military aid to an ally in order to boost growth in countries with which they share political ideals and aims For those benevolent countries the incentive to be generous is partly rooted in the expectation that as the economy of the allied country grows they will receive an economic dividend Yet in the world the authors depict the reward is not fixed If a country economic fortunes become less entangled with some places and more with others then the relative pay-off from making costly political investments in those places changesand so over time will patterns of political friendship and enmity Economic interdependence in other words causes political rapprochement The authors reckon that China early liberalisation by driving a one-off surge in the country economic engagement with the world provides evidence for this proposition In assessing economic interdependence they focus on one measure: how productivity growth in one country affects real incomes in others Economic heft alone does not ensure that other places’ fortunes are bound up with your own Instead both rapid economic growth and extensive involvement in global supply chains can amplify a country economic influence on its trading partners Though initially modest China global economic influence had by the late 2000s overtaken America: the effect of Chinese growth on the incomes of its trading partners was larger than that of Uncle Sam indeed nearly double it by 2010 From 1980 to 2010 the paper finds the more economically enmeshed a country became with China the more political alignment ensued as captured by patterns of un voting the forming of formal alliances and similar metrics The authors find further support for their model by looking at global trade shifts associated with collapsing air-freight costs Because shipping by sea must flow around continents whereas aircraft follow great-circle routes the falling cost of air freight in the three decades to 2010 had uneven effects on bilateral trade flows around the globe This variation offers another way to test how growth in economic interdependence leads to political alignmentand the test again is conclusive This would seem to back oft-aired concerns that China rise has not just redrawn the geopolitical map but also helped to erode democracy worldwide Yet here the news is encouraging New work by Giacomo Magistretti of the imf and Marco Tabellini of Harvard University also exploits falling air-transport costs to tease out the causal effect of trade on both attitudes towards democracy and the overall political orientation of a country They find that stronger economic ties indeed facilitate the transmission of political valuesbut only if said values are democraticThe effects are big People who grew up during periods when their home economy traded comparatively more with democracies appear to be much more drawn to open regimes than those who came of age under opposite circumstances The difference in attitudes is equivalent to that between the support reported by residents of Sweden a bunch of hardcore democrats and those of China who are more tentative Pro-democracy populations in turn translate into more open institutions An 80% rise in trade with democratic countries over a five-year period raises a country Polity score which measures how democratic a country governing institutions are on a scale from -10 to 10 by four points: the difference roughly between Russia and Britain Strikingly trade with autocracies seems to have no such effect Excluding America or China from the analysis does not alter the resultsBye AmericaWhy should trade with democracies work this way? The data do not permit firm conclusions But evidence suggests the spur to democratisation does not stem from faster economic growth or rising levels of education Neither does it result from increased migration Instead the authors’ favourite theory assumes that trade with democracies boosts a country “democratic capital”: it fosters an appreciation for the value of democracy which helps cement a social consensus in support of democratic institutions That seems plausible if perhaps a little vagueBoth trade and geopolitics will look different in the years ahead than they did during the post-war era of American hegemony and globalisation But economic ties are likely to retain their capacity to cultivate allies and shore up support for democracy If Mr Biden wishes to bolster America national security he might consider giving freer trade a chance Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to unleash more investment in intangible assets May 21stThe world needs a new economic motor Could India fit the bill?

 May 24th 2022,America new Asian economic pact: just don’t call it a trade deal,A mere three days after being sworn in as president in January 2017 Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership tpp a 12-country free-trade deal he had railed against on the campaign trail On May 23rd 488 days after his own swearing-in President Joe Biden tried to reverse some of the damage by unveiling a new pact the 13-country Indo-Pacific Economic Framework ipef That Mr Biden took so much longer to launch his Asian trade policy illustrates one basic truth: it is far easier to tear up agreements than it is to craft them anewListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInevitably one way to look at the ipef is by way of comparison to the tpp which lives on in reduced form absent America Some bits sound rather familiar One selling-point for the tpp was that it was a “21st-century trade agreement” complete with high standards for workers’ rights and e-commerce rules The ipef is also “a 21st-century economic arrangement” according to Jake Sullivan America national security adviser The original tpp members accounted for nearly 40% of global gdp roughly the same share as the current ipef partners Most crucially China is still excluded The ipef like the tpp is an attempt to build a trading structure in Asia that enshrines both America economic principles and its economic powerwelcomed by many in the region as a counterbalance to China heftThat however is where the similarities end Mr Trump success in winning support with his calls to stop countries “ripping off” America has made many in Washington leery of ambitious free-trade deals So rather than starting work on a pact that would require approval from Congress Mr Biden team has designed a framework that is more malleable and may avoid that political death-trap In announcing the launch Katherine Tai the United States Trade Representative ustr pledged to “keep Congress close” in shaping the ipefa far cry from putting it to a voteMalleability has a few big downsides It limits what America can offer A cut in tariff rates a plank of most free-trade deals is a non-starter because it would require congressional support America still vows to push for strong labour and environmental standards but unable to offer more access to its vast market it lacks a key bargaining chip The durability of the ipef is also in doubt Were Mr Trump to return to the Oval Office in 2024 he would not need three days to ditch the frameworkThe Biden administration has tried to make a virtue of these limits Rather than conceiving of the ipef as a conventional deal it has declared that the pact will rest on four pillars with trade promotion just one The other three goals are to make supply chains more resilient; to promote infrastructure investment and clean energy; and to form new rules on taxation and anti-corruption It is tempting to dismiss such a wide-ranging agenda as too vague to amount to anything But paradoxically a near-stumble at the launch of the framework illustrated that it could in theory have force to its contents: America had to tone down the language in its founding documents otherwise some in Asia would have balked at signing themMatthew Goodman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies a think-tank notes that the focus on topics such as digital trade competition policy and bribery makes for a good menu for the ipef “These are issues that are very much in the interest of our partners in the region” he says At the same time breadth poses a challenge Instead of just having the ustr as the lead negotiator as in normal trade talks the Commerce Department is in charge of the non-trade portfolio That risks turning it into a multi-headed beastFor now many in the region are most pleased by the symbolism The wounds from America tpp exit are still raw Since Mr Biden election victory allies have waited and waited for America to devise a new Asian trade strategy At last it has arrived even if it is more notable for its political constraints than its economic potential “We are just happy to have them at the table” says one Australian official For more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America sign up to Checks and Balance our weekly newsletter And for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 22nd 2022,Foreign investors are fleeing China,Jing’an century a housing development with ponds and lush greenery in north Shanghai should have been bustling as workers put the finishing touches on flats Instead the area is silent A two-month lockdown of the city of 25m people has forced Yanlord the developer to halt construction on the site Homebuyers have been on edge for months as some of the country largest developers default on bonds and struggle to deliver homesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow Yanlord until recently deemed in decent shape is telling customers they will not receive their properties on time At least 20 housing developments across the city have announced similar delays Many other projects have been forced to stop selling units The lockdown has been so severe that roadblocks and police checkpoints have mushroomed Workers materials and sales agents have been unable to reach construction sites Meanwhile Yanlord pre-sales of homes have slumped to less than 20% of the level a year agoChina property crisis is not new But growing fears among foreign investors of a grand policy disaster are The combination of a nosediving housing market and Xi Jinping uncompromising zero-covid policy is just one recent conundrum that has led foreign fund managers to question whether China is losing its pragmatic approach to managing the economy Mr Xi insistence on using prolonged lockdowns to rid China of the Omicron variant and his backing for Russia war in Ukraine strike many investors as ideological Add in the timing of his crackdown on tech groups such as Alibaba an e-commerce company and on the leverage of property giants such as Evergrande and it is not hard to see why some of the world largest investment groups are questioning the quality of leadership in Beijing Many attribute this and other campaigns to preparations for this autumn Communist Party congress at which Mr Xi is expected to be granted another five years in office The events of 2022 could shape how global investors view China for years to comeIn little over a year Mr Xi policies have had a profoundand painfulimpact on global markets They have knocked $2trn from Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong and New York Chinese initial public offerings in these two cities have nearly ground to a halt this year China property firms have sold just $280m in high-yield dollar bonds so far in 2022 down from $156bn during the same period last year Within China the value of yuan-denominated financial assets held by foreigners fell by more than 1trn yuan $150bn in the first quarter of 2022 the biggest drop ever The Institute of International Finance iif a bankers’ group in Washington forecasts that $300bn in capital will flow out of the country this year up from $129bn in 2021 Onshore markets were one of the linchpins of China relations with the outside world The belief that they would continue to open up helped to maintain links with Western financiers hoping to strike it rich Even as relations between America and China soured during the Trump years a craving for onshore securities took hold of many of the world biggest financial groups As a trade war dampened global sentiment regulators in Beijing began expediting long-promised reforms eventually allowing foreign financial groups to wholly own their onshore businesses The policies were a clear sign that Beijing meant business And the West reciprocated In 2018 msci added Chinese shares to its flagship emerging-markets index Other index inclusions followed creating a flood of foreign capital into onshore Chinese securities Between the start of 2017 and a peak at the end of 2021 foreign financial exposure to yuan-denominated assets more than tripled to 108trn yuanThat elation has fizzled Many foreign investors simply grew too enthusiastic about China and chose to ignore the risks says Hugh Young of Aberdeen an asset manager But the market is waking up The view from many investors is that although China has never been more open to foreign capital it has also not been this ideologically inflexible in recent memory China support for Russia has fed concerns over its claim on Taiwan which it vows eventually to take back by any means necessary Geopolitical concerns such as this are part of a broad recalibration of the risks associated with China “Policy risk has increased markedly” says Neil Shearing of Capital Economics a research firm That has led investors to demand a higher risk premium on Chinese assetsSome leading investment groups are starting to air these views in public BlackRock a giant asset manager that has been expanding rapidly in China said on May 9th that it had shifted its six- to 12-month view of Chinese equities to “neutral” from “modest overweight” Julius Baer a private bank said in April that it was ending a five-year call that Chinese equities would eventually become a “core asset class”This shift has contributed to a foreign sell-off of onshore stocks and bonds The unpopularity of yuan-denominated bonds has also been driven by a weaker currency and higher interest rates in America The value of foreign-held equities in China fell by nearly 20% in the first three months of the year or by about 755bn yuan Much of the drop was due to a fall in stock valuations; the csi 300 a key index is down by more than 17% since January But foreign investors are also scaling back their exposure Total foreign equity holdings have ebbed by about 2% so far this year calculates Gavekal a research group As a share of China stockmarket they fell from about 43% at the end of 2021 to just below 4% in March An interest-rate cut by the central bank on May 20th did little to buoy sentiment Several portfolio managers expect outflows to continue until there is more clarity around economic policyThe gloomy mood has been painful for China small and diminishing cohort of liberal technocrats who are still promoting the idea of an open China that is at least mildly sensitive to the concerns of global investors For years regulators have used carefully timed reforms to reward loyal long-term investors As sentiment soured in April they succeeded in delivering long-awaited private-pension reforms in an attempt to woo asset managers It was a salve regulators had been holding on to in the expectation that sentiment would worsen early this year says one fund manager Many investors see 2022 as a bellwether year for the direction of policy The optimistic outlook is that this gloomy period of ideology policy missteps and slow growth is part of the preparation for the party congress in the autumn Once that passes pragmatists will have more control of policy Zero-covid will end Support for the economy and tech firms will returnThis camp includes many of the investment managers who have slogged it out in China for decades Global banks have been telling investors for 20 years that the Chinese market is a one-way bet Only a war over Taiwan or a hot conflict of that nature could upend that narrative says one foreign banker in ChinaThe pessimistic view is that Mr Xi is serious about the direction in which he has taken China over the past two years and that the future will be far more ideological s&p a rating agency warned on May 19th that policy shocks to education housing labour and social welfare could continue for years Global investors have been slow to grasp the significance of China policy changes says Nikolaj Schmidt of T Rowe Price an investment manager It is unlikely things will return to normal soonMr Xi zero-covid policy and the unrelenting lockdown of Shanghai have also raised concerns about China leadership Some investors worry that the country has turned its back on growth; that zero-covid could be a sign of a factional struggle in Beijing; or that it will eventually lead to one “When investors hear they’re getting dragged into politics that when they get nervous” says Sean Debow of Eurizon Capital Asia an asset managerOne probable outcome in the months ahead is a growing divergence between the investors outside China and those with large offices inside the country Many groups that have worked for decades to open up in China are continuing to hire staff Investors that have accessed the onshore market through Hong Kong by contrast may continue to reduce their exposure If anything investing in China will only become more divisive this year For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 19th 2022,Why crypto bruising comedown matters,It has been a vicious year for financial markets and more punishing still for crypto assets The market capitalisation of crypto has slumped to just $13trn from nearly $3trn in November On May 18th bitcoin traded at around $29000 a mere 40% of its all-time high in November; the price of ether another cryptocurrency has collapsed just as spectacularly Six months ago Coinbase an exchange and the leading crypto-industry stock was worth $79bn Now it is valued at just $14bn and the firm is “reassessing its headcount needs” Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe sell-off comes as the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates Tech stocks high-yield bonds and other risky assets have also swooned But crypto bruising comedown is interesting for a deeper reason: it has exposed weaknesses in the plumbing of the system The problems lie with the market for stablecoins a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another currency often the dollar Added together all stablecoins the largest of which are tether and usd coin usdc are worth around $170bn These act as a bridge between conventional banks where people use dollars and the “on-blockchain” world where people use crypto The biggest such coins are also used by exchanges as a base for trading between cryptocurrenciesFrom May 9th terra then the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalisation began to unravel The implosion put pressure on tether which is meant to be pegged one-for-one with the dollar On May 12th its price dipped to 95 cents Some $91bn in tether has since been redeemed for cash The technology and the jargon associated with crypto may be newfangled but to students of financial history these events look familiar They resemble the confidence crises that precede bank runs Every stablecoin has a mechanism to maintain its peg The simplest and safest method is to hold a dollar in a bank account or in safe liquid assets like Treasury bills for every stablecoin token The token can be traded freely by buyers and sellers; when a seller wants to offload their stablecoin they either sell it on the open market or redeem it for its dollar value from the issuer who then destroys the token usdc and tether use versions of this methodOthers like terra are called “algorithmic stablecoins” because they use an automated process to support the peg Their main distinguishing feature however is in how they are backed Terra is backed by luna a cryptocurrency issued by Terraform Labs which also runs terra The idea was that holders of terra could always redeem it for one dollar worth of newly minted luna On May 5th when luna was trading at $85 a piece that meant a terra holder could redeem it for 00118 lunas If for some reason terra was trading at less than $1 arbitrageurs could swoop in buy a terra redeem it for luna and sell that for a profitThat system worked as long as luna had some market value But on May 9th the price of luna began to slide And that in turn put pressure on terra pegcausing a rush to redeem The supply of luna ballooned On May 10th 350m tokens existed By May 15th 65trn did As the price of luna collapsed terra also went into free fall Its price is now hovering at around 10 cents Luna is worthless Do Kwon the founder of Terraform has tried to resuscitate terra He has turned the blockchain off and on again “burned” tokens and attempted to split the blockchain But nothing has worked so far Terra implosion has had wider and more worrying repercussions: it has prompted flight from tether Those fleeing may have felt anxious about the lack of detail regarding tether backing The company once said it backed its tokens with “us dollars” a claim New York attorney-general said in 2021 was “a lie” Now the firm says its tokens are “backed 100% by Tether reserves” This appears to be some mix of cash Treasuries and corporate debt but the company has refused to disclose the details claiming that its asset mix is its “secret sauce” As with many past bank runs where depositors fled to safety holders have sold off terra and tether and rushed to tokens perceived to be of higher quality One example is usd coin which holds only cash or Treasuries and publishes regular audited reports to that effect Dai another stablecoin backed by crypto and managed by algorithms has managed to maintain its peg Still that other stablecoins have survived might be small comfort if tether does not If tether really is backed by illiquid assets or perhaps assets that have fallen in value this year then the more some holders redeem its tokens the less remains in the pot for others The implosion of the world biggest and oldest stablecoin would be much more catastrophic than was terra Tether is not only a financial bridge between crypto and conventional moneyie dollars in bank accountsbut also between all kinds of crypto pairs that are traded on exchanges The three biggest and most liquid cryptocurrency pairs on Binance the biggest exchange for instance are bitcoin and tether; ether and tether; and Binance own stablecoin busd and tetherTether redeems only its big users who are pulling $100000 or more from it at a time and even then at its discretion Nonetheless redemptions have continued apace over the past week The loss of the peg on May 12th was a reflection of the stinginess of that system Smaller holders who wanted out had to sell the token on the open market The stablecoin has not fully recovered its peg For a year it traded at or above $1; since May 12th it has traded slightly below it Crypto most important bit of plumbing is still leaking For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 19th 2022,India once-vaunted statistical infrastructure is crumbling,The modern Indian state has a proud statistical heritage Soon after the country gained independence in 1947 the government resolved to achieve its development through comprehensive five-year plans The strategy though economically inadvisable nonetheless required the creation of a robust data-gathering apparatus In 1950 PC Mahalanobis the leading light of Indian statistics designed the National Sample Survey which sent staff to the far corners of the vast country to jot down data regarding its mostly illiterate citizens The survey complexity and scope seemed “beyond the bounds of possibility” reckoned one American statistician Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOf late however admiration has been replaced by alarm India statistical services are in a bad way Across some measures figures are simply not gathered; for others the data are often dodgy unrepresentative untimely or just wrong The country tracking of covid-19 provides a grim example As the pandemic raged across India officials struggled to keep tabs on its toll Officially covid has claimed more than half a million lives in India; The Economist excess-deaths tracker puts the figure far higher between 2m and 94m India government has also hampered efforts to assess the pandemic global impact refusing at first to share data with the World Health Organisation who and criticising its methods The preference for flattering but flawed figures is pervasive In education state governments regularly ignore data showing that Indian children are performing woefully in school and instead cite their own administrative numbers which are often wrong In Madhya Pradesh a state in central India an official assessment showed that all pupils had scored more than 60% in a maths test; an independent assessment revealed that none of them had Similarly in sanitation the central government says that India is now free of open defecation meaning that people both have access to a toilet and consistently use it Anyone who takes a train out of Delhi at dawn and looks out of the window however might question the claim When it comes to poverty arguably India biggest problem timely figures are not available Official estimates are based on a poverty line derived from consumption data in 2011-12 despite the fact that more recent but as yet unpublished numbers exist for 2017-18 By contrast Indonesia calculates its poverty rate twice a year India government explains its approach by pointing to discrepancies between recently gathered data and national accounts statisticsbut many suspect the true reason is that newer data would probably show an increase in povertyIn some cases flawed data seem more a problem of methodology than malign intent India gdp estimates for instance have been mired in controversy ever since the statistics ministry introduced a new series in 2015 a change that was in the works before the current government entered office Arvind Subramanian a former government adviser calculated that the new methodology overestimated average annual growth by as much as three to four percentage points between 2011-12 and 2016-17 Although current advisers insist that the official methodology is in line with global standards other studies have also found problems with the calculations The erosion of India statistical infrastructure predates the current government but seems to have grown worse in recent years Narendra Modi the prime minister has previously bristled at technocratic expertise and number-crunching “Hard work is more powerful than Harvard” he said in 2017 India data woes are also troubling for what they suggest about the ability of the state to provide the essential public services needed to foster long-run growth The statistics ministry short of staff and resources is emblematic of the civil service Data-gathering has become excessively centralised and over-politicised A National Statistical Commission was set up in 2005 and tasked with fixing India data infrastructure But its work has been complicated by turf wars and internal politics;

It has been bandied around quite freely in recent years applied not just to the usual suspects such as Russian or Iranian assets fenced off by financial sanctions but also to less obvious candidates Jim Cramer of cnbc a tv channel described oil stocks as uninvestible in January 2020 calling them the new tobacco Not so long ago the same was said about big banks and the whole of southern EuropeThe odd thing is that the word has become more common even as the world has become more investible Thanks to financial innovation and globalisation far-flung assets are far easier to buy than they used to be Back in 1988 msci emerging-markets equity index included only ten countries with a combined market capitalisation of just over $50bn The index now includes 24 countries with a market value of $69trn At the end of last year the value of global investible assets reached a record high of $179trn according to State Street an asset manager That is equivalent to 186% of world gdp in 2021 up from 116% in 2000Even in his unedited report Mr Yao did not argue that it was impossible to hold Chinese internet stocks Indeed he advised global investors to remain “neutral” on 11 of them So what was on his mind? He worried that the depositary receipts of some internet firms might be delisted from American exchanges because China has been reluctant to open the books of its auditors to American regulators This in itself would not make them uninvestible because the shares of most of these companies can also be bought in Hong Kong as Mr Yao himself pointed out But he saw this regulatory row as the latest manifestation of the geopolitical risks faced by China which became more salient after Russia invaded Ukraine Because of these risks he said global investors were likely to shun Chinese internet firms over the next 6 to 12 months however cheap they became During this “stage” he argued these stocks could no longer be valued by simply projecting their earnings and cashflow Only after foreign investors had departed would his “valuation frameworks” regain relevance presumably because the remaining investors locals and China specialists would be less sensitive to Sino-American relations He recommended revisiting the sector only when this new stage arrivedWhen would that be? The answer he admitted depended on “many unpredictable factors outside our forecast capability” It turns out he was right In a more upbeat report on May 16th he said that the second stage had already arrived well ahead of schedule Thanks to some encouraging noises on the delisting dispute Mr Yao believes that geopolitical risks have receded enough to give his valuation framework some purchase once again He duly offered new higher price targets for 18 companies His editors were then right that “uninvestible” was the wrong word “Unanalysable” would have been better if even uglier It is not that Chinese internet stocks could not be bought merely that they could not be valued using Mr Yao preferred framework which could not accommodate geopolitical risk Unfortunately few assets these days are entirely free of such risks Anyone taking a view on commodity prices and thus on inflation and therefore interest rates is also taking a view on war and peace If more investible assets are not to become unanalysable stockpickers may have to invest in a broader view of the world Read more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why Italy borrowing costs are surging once again May 14thWho wins from carnage in the credit markets?

 May 19th 2022,How to unleash more investment in intangible assets,When russia invaded Ukraine tangible things at first seemed all too important Bombs and bullets were what mattered; commodity markets were roiled; supply chains were upturned As the war has gone on however intangible factors have asserted their importance too The managerial and logistical know-how of the armed forces on either side as well as technological advantages like Ukraine deployment of Bayraktar drones have altered the course of the war So too has the goodwill that Ukraine has attracted from people around the world which has in turn led foreign governments to lend the country more support Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea that intangible assets though hard to see and measure are critically important to foster is the main message of a new book by Jonathan Haskel a Bank of England policymaker and Stian Westlake of Britain Royal Statistical Society “Restarting the Future” is their second book The first “Capitalism Without Capital” published in 2017 argued that the economics of intangible assets helped explain stagnating economic growth and rising inequality The new book goes a step further asking how the bottlenecks holding investment in intangibles back might be loosenedthereby fostering a more efficient and faster-growing economy Their work is part of a wave of writing on the future pace of growth which includes Dietrich Vollrath “Fully Grown” and Robert Gordon “The Rise and Fall of American Growth” Intangible investment includes the research and development conducted by firms as well as things like marketing design and branding In the late 1990s by some measures spending on intangibles in America overtook investment in tangible plant and equipment But the pace of spending has slowed since the financial crisis The authors note that annual growth in intangible capital in rich countries tended to be around 3-7% between 1995 and 2008 Over the subsequent decade however it barely surpassed 3% in any single year That did not just reflect slower economic growth Intangible investment also stopped rising as a share of gdp which poses something of a conundrum considering that corporate profits were strong Although the burst of overall investment in the past year or so has been impressive cross-country data on intangibles are not yet available Nor is it clear that the investment surge has done enough to alter the sluggish trendThe nub of the problem say Messrs Haskel and Westlake is that the economic and financial arrangements that exist to support investment are geared towards spending on capital goods not intangibles They point out that bursts of economic growth such as those in medieval Italian city states and in China between the 10th and 13th centuries have often faded precisely because institutions failed to generate the right incentives and activity Part of the solution this time say the authors is to encourage the financing of investment in intangibles A study by the oecd which looks at 29 developed economies from 1995 to 2015 suggests that intangible-heavy sectors are more productive in places with more developed financial systems where they can access finance more easily Differences in financial development as measured by a combination of equity-market capitalisation and total credit to gdp can explain why annual labour-productivity growth in a sector like computer equipment where two-thirds of assets are intangible has been a percentage point higher in more financially developed countries like Japan than in places like PortugalVenture capital vc has been a preferred source of equity funding for firms conducting the most intangible activity such as biotechnology and consumer-tech But that has been disproportionately available to American companies with a plan for extremely rapid growth In many parts of the world a lot of business investment is still debt-financed and more dependent on the use of physical assets as collateral America vc industry took off after pension funds were allowed to invest in less liquid investments in 1979 That may help explain why business investment in America has held up better than in many other places The authors therefore advocate for larger investment vehicles that pool risk for individual lenders elsewhere in the world like the Long-Term Asset Fund launched in Britain last year which helps pension funds gain exposure to long-term illiquid assets Ending the tax advantages of debt financing by removing the tax deductibility of interest payments say would help level the playing-field between tangible and intangible investment Other prescriptions relate to how and where investment occurs Patent law for instance should not prevent the combination of existing ideas More important still is the role of cities which the authors note are cauldrons of intangible investment: they make it easier to form the relationships that make intangibles happen encourage new ideas and create a larger pool of beneficiaries when investments spill over Making cities work therefore with better land-use and zoning policies is vitalCan’t touch this “Restarting the Future” may be emblematic of a shift in economists’ thinking on growth In the 2010s debates raged over how best to address persistent shortfalls in demand In the inflationary-looking 2020s the emphasis is on unleashing the economy supply potential But where researchers such as Mr Gordon and Mr Vollrath regarded the bursts of rapid growth in the 20th century as the exception not the rule Messrs Haskel and Westlake are more hopeful of a return to headier rates of growth Mr Gordon argued that the digital economy was a busted flush when it came to growth; Mr Vollrath saw slower growth as a symptom of economic success a larger services sector and reduced geographic mobility By presenting solutions “Restarting the Future” offers a more optimistic visionas long that is as governments follow its advice Read more from Free Exchange our column on

 May 19th 2022,Offset markets struggle in the face of surging commodity prices,The loamy soil and dense jungle of the Sumatran rainforest in Indonesia can store an average of 282 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare If a group of climate-conscious airline passengers were to find a hectare of such forest at risk of being cut down for palm oil and were able to stop that happening they would offset the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by 175 passengers flying economy class from London to New York and backListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDemand for such carbon offsets is forecast to rocket over the next couple of decades as businesses attempt to make good on their promises to reach net zero carbon emissions Last year an estimated $1bn was spent on offsets McKinsey a consultancy predicts that the size of the market could expand by a factor of 15 by 2030 and 100 by 2050 Although a few projects use novel technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the air altogether and store it underground most offsets promise to subsidise renewables or pay for carbon sinks such as forests to be restored or preserved Such “nature-based” offsets can include protecting wetlands in Colombia or restoring peatland in ScotlandBut the market is not working The price of a carbon offset is far too low The opportunity cost of leaving land uncultivated is rising A hectare of Sumatran rainforest for instance could produce around 25 tonnes of palm oil a year and palm-oil prices have risen to $1520 a tonne from around $1000 a year ago But the price of nature-based offsets has fallen this year to $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide according to contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Deforestation remains economically rational Because a palm-oil plantation still captures around 170 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hectare leaving the land uncultivated offsets only 112 tonnes An offset price of $10 means that if the accounting is done properly selling offsets yields revenue of only $1120not enough to compensate for the potential loss of about $3800 in annual sales of palm oil At current prices says Ariel Perez of Hartree Partners a trading firm the only agricultural activity that is less profitable than preserving forests is harvesting rubber in West Africa For as long as the price of an offset remains below $20 cattle farming in the Amazon will remain attractive Why has the price of offsets fallen? Some cap-and-trade schemes in which companies must buy permits for their emissions allow for a certain amount of emissions to be offset By and large however offsets are not required by regulation Firms and individuals seeking to reduce their carbon footprints choose to buy them meaning that the demand for offsets is largely driven by ethical or public-relations imperatives As the war in Ukraine began and attention turned away from climate change offset prices declined Another problem is that there are few internationally agreed rules for offsets A report published earlier this month by Carbon Direct a consultancy said that “the voluntary carbon market largely consists of projects of questionable quality” A surplus of older and less reliable offsets hangs over the market depressing prices It is not possible to truly know what would have happened had an offset not been paid for “Most projects over-report and some don’t reduce emissions at all” says Barbara Haya of the University of California Berkeley “It really hard for people to know what is real and what isn’t”Some attempts are being made to bring clarity Proposals from the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets an independent committee are expected later this year They are likely to emphasise the need for “additionality” meaning that the reduction in emissions claimed must be a direct result of the offset Paying for green-energy installation for instance would not count as a genuine offset if the project were viable without the offset payment Nor would a forest that was never going to be cut down in the first place Checking that offsets meet the criterion though will remain a daunting task For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 May 19th 2022,Even China official economic figures look bleak,When china was locked down during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 economic forecasters had to make two predictions: how much would the economy suffer? And how much of this suffering would the official statistics be allowed to reflect? When China reported a historic 135% decline in industrial production in January and February 2020 compared with a year earlier it surprised many forecasters not because it diverged from their bleak view of the economy but because it challenged their cynical view of the statisticiansListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow that China is squirming under its most stringent lockdowns since early 2020 the same conundrum has returned How bad will the economy get? And how faithful will the data be? An early answer to both questions arrived this week The data were worse than expected and therefore worthier than feared On May 16th China reported that industrial production fell by 29% in April compared with a year earlier Compared with the previous month it fell by over 7% according to the National Bureau of Statistics The number was the most consequential surprise since the spring of 2020 according to a measure by Goldman Sachs which considers both the scale of the forecast error and the significance of the indicator Retail sales fell by 14% compared with a year earlier once adjusted for inflation Catering fell by more than 22% and car sales by over 30% in nominal terms In locked-down Shanghai sales of cars were “about zero” according to the Shanghai Automobile Sales AssociationSome of the most spectacular declines were in the all-important property sector Sales of new homes fell by 42% and housing starts by over 44% Even China unemployment figures long mocked for their uncanny stability were morbidly interesting In 2018 China rolled out a new unemployment survey in its cities This superseded an older spectacularly uninformative measure which counted the number of people who qualified for and were able to claim unemployment benefits The new survey showed unemployment rising to 61% in April still a little below its peak of 62% in February 2020 But in 31 big cities unemployment is now 67% whereas it reached only 57% in 2020 This suggests that Omicronor the policy response to ithas hurt China larger cities disproportionately The pattern of economic pain is different this time It remains to be seen whether these grimly realistic monthly indicators will translate into a similarly unflattering official gdp figure for the second quarter When the pandemic first struck China had yet to commit itself to an official growth target for the year That perhaps gave it more leeway to report a big drop in first-quarter gdp This year by contrast China leaders have already set a target of around 55% and promised as recently as April 29th to try to meet their economic goals It is just not clear how On May 15th China authorities said the floor on mortgage rates would be cut for first-time buyers But that will make little difference if people cannot go out to view properties The government has also placed great emphasis on infrastructure investment But this increased by only 43% in nominal terms in April compared with a year earlierfar short of the 18% pace that Natixis a bank thinks it needs to reach if China is to grow anywhere near 5% this yearUntil the authorities relax their covid controls their efforts to revive growth are likely to be ineffective They must therefore be hoping that Omicron recedes fast enough to allow growth to catch up later in the year Alternatively if China cannot bring itself to abandon its growth target it may have to fiddle its gdp figures That would be a pity Many of China economic indicators may be shrinking dramatically But their credibility edged up this week For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 17th 2022,A baby-formula shortage feeds criticism of corporate heft and price gouging,Shoppers have become all too familiar with the fragility of supply chains In America the latest product missing from supermarket shelves is infant formula Whereas previous shortages affecting everything from cars to couches presented an inconvenience a lack of nourishment for babies creates serious health risks So the administration has swung into action On May 16th the Food and Drug Administration fda said America would loosen restrictions on imports of formula Two days later President Joe Biden invoked the Defence Production Act to boost domestic production Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThere are several explanations for the shortage The biggest problem has been a halt to production at a facility in Michigan since February when officials began investigating infections in four babies possibly caused by its milk-based powder A lack of packaging delays to the import of ingredients and staffing vacancies have also contributed to the headache As much as 43% of formula products were out of stock across America in early May according to Datasembly a data firm Some politicians and analysts have also pointed to two deeper problems in the American economy supposedly exposed by the shortages: corporate concentration and price gouging The former is a valid concern; the latter is a distractionJust four companies Abbott Gerber Perrigo and Reckitt Benckiser make nearly all of America formula The production stoppage occurred at a factory owned by Abbott which controls around 40% of the market It is an illustration of how reduced competition seen in about three-quarters of American industries over the past 30 years can serve the economy poorly Concentration in the formula market has been exacerbated by regulation About 98% of formula consumed in America is made domestically because of the fda stringent approval process for foreign factories And more than half is purchased through a nutrition programme for low-income families which in turn buys from a single supplier in each state In 2007 when California switched its contract from Abbott to Mead Johnson now owned by Reckitt Abbott market share there fell from 90% to 5% while Mead rose from 5% to 95% On May 13th a group of Democratic senators called for an antitrust review of the industry If that were to happen it would not solve the shortages at hand but it could put the market on sounder footingMore dubious are claims about the severity of price gouging Mr Biden has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether “unscrupulous profiteers” were scooping up formula in shops and reselling it for hugely marked-up prices And there have indeed been instances of such anti-social behaviourBut for some in the Democratic Party these allegations about pricing now fit into a broader narrative that corporate greed lies at the root of high inflation Elizabeth Warren a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and several colleagues introduced a bill on May 12th that would “prohibitprice gouging during all abnormal market disruptions” They cited a study by the Economic Policy Institute a left-wing think-tank which argued that fatter profit margins have driven more than half of price rises since 2020 Mr Biden has also seized on greed as an explanation for high prices On May 13th he tweeted that making the wealthiest companies pay “their fair share” would bring down inflationIn theory the fiscal drag that would come from higher taxes without any offsetting increase in government spending could reduce inflation as well as growth But if corporate greed explains high inflation why did so many prices only start to soar well after the pandemic began? It is not as if companies just discovered a love of profits Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon was right to criticise Mr Biden tweet as “misdirection” accusing him of trying to muddy the water in the debate over prices Indeed something far more basic explains the run-up in inflation: a surge in stimulus-fuelled demand compounded by disruptions to supply For individual products the signal sent by higher prices is the most effective way to bring supply and demand back into balance In the case of baby formula it encourages domestic companies to make more and foreign producers to run the gauntlet of approvals Much like formula itself higher prices can play a part in healthy development For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

It is the world sixth-largest economyas China was in 2000 And its output today stands broadly where China stood two decades ago China went on to manage an average annual growth rate of about 9% India grew by just under 7% per year over the same period It might easily have done better though were it not for policy mistakessuch as Prime Minister Narendra Modi shock decision to withdraw some banknotes in 2016and macroeconomic vulnerabilities including an overextended financial sector The government may have learnt from the first; both policymakers and the banks have worked to address the second Before the war in Ukraine the IMF had reckoned that India might grow by 9% this year Some optimists argue that in the right circumstances India could manage such rates on a sustained basisA closer look however suggests that India is not a substitute for China One problem is that the world economy is much larger than it used to be such that a given rise in India GDP raises global growth by less Sustained annual growth of 9% would vastly improve the lives of Indians and meaningfully tilt the balance of global economic and political power But it would not mean that the world economy would revolve around India as it did around China over the past two decades India contribution to global growth would remain smaller than that of America and Europe combined for examplePerhaps more important global economic conditions may be considerably more forbidding than those that enabled China rise From 1995 to 2008 the value of world trade rose from 17% of global GDP to 25% The share of goods exports participating in global value chains rose from about 44% of world exports to 52% China was at the forefront of both trends It was the most dominant trading country since imperial Britain according to an analysis of “hyperglobalisation” published in 2013 by Arvind Subramanian of Brown University and Martin Kessler of the OECD a rich-country think-tankIndia by contrast is a trade minnow On the eve of the pandemic it accounted for less than 2% of global merchandise exports It hopes to raise that share by investing in infrastructure providing public subsidies to manufacturers and negotiating trade deals with uncharacteristic enthusiasm But times have changed World trade has fallen as a share of global GDP since the early 2010s Economic nationalism could stymie a recovery India may nonetheless hope to increase its exports by capturing market share from other economiesincluding China But businesses and governments that were once willing to rely heavily on China in the name of efficiency have become more cautious Their reluctance to become too dependent on any one source of supply could check India ambitionsDominating global supply chains may not be the only route to economic influence India is a precocious exporter of tech and business services; though its GDP is only one-sixth that of China its services exports only just lag behind the latter Research published in 2020 by Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva and Rikard Forslid of Stockholm University argues that technological change is expanding the range of exportable services and providing more opportunities for workers in poor countries to compete with services workers in the rich world But while tech and business services may continue to thrive in India their expansion may be limited by an inadequate system of education which performs well on measures of enrolment but not of learning outcomes and by the protected nature of rich-world service sectors which may be better insulated against foreign competition than were industrial workers against Chinese importsSubcontinental surgeEven if India manages a growth rate of nearer 6% than 9% that would be nothing to sneeze at It would make India the world third-largest economy by the mid-2030s at which point it would contribute more to global GDP each year than Britain Germany and Japan combined Indian demand for resources would then drive commodity prices; its capital markets would tantalise foreign investors A large English-speaking population and a democratic political system if India can keep it may allow Indian tech and cultural exports to wield more global influence than did China at similar income levelsBut the world by then will have recognised if it has not already that the rise of China was a unique event Indian growth will be world-changing But you should neither hope for nor fear a reprise of the Chinese experience Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Why long-term economic growth often disappoints May 7thHow would an energy embargo affect Germany economy?

 May 14th 2022,Even outside America inflation is starting to look entrenched,INFLATION DOMINATES the American popular psyche to an extent not seen since the 1980s when prices were last rising at the current pace Much like complaining about the weather or last night basketball play-offs moaning about higher prices has become a conversation starter According to figures published on May 11th consumer prices rose by 83% in April compared with the previous year A day earlier President Joe Biden called fighting inflation his “top domestic priority” Newspapers are publishing four times as many stories mentioning inflation as they did a year ago; several polls suggest that Americans believe inflation is a bigger problem for their country than the war in Ukraine But America is not alone Inflation is also becoming baked into everyday life in other parts of the rich worldListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Economist has gathered data on five indicators across ten big economies”core” inflation which excludes food and energy prices; the dispersion in inflation rates for the sub-components of the consumer-price index; labour costs; inflation expectations; and Google searches for inflation To gauge where inflation has become most pervasive we rank each country according to how it fares on each measure and then combine these ranks to form an “inflation entrenchment” scoreContinental Europe so far at least seems to have escaped the worst of the scourge Inflation is leaving barely a trace on Japan But it is entwining itself around Anglophone economies Canada is faring slightly worse even than America Britain has a big problem on its hands see chartA few factors explain the differences Total fiscal stimulus across Anglophone countries in 2020-21 was about 40% more generous than in other rich places according to our estimates It was also more focused on handouts to households such as stimulus cheques That may have further stoked demand Monetary policy in the euro area and Japan was already ultra-loose before the pandemic limiting the amount of extra stimulus central banks could provide Britain inflation may also reflect an idiosyncratic factor: Brexit It turns out that breaking with your largest trading partner causes costs to riseThe simplest component of our ranking is the rate of core inflation This measure gives a better sense of underlying price pressure Among our ten countries America leads the pack though core inflation is above average pretty much everywhereA second measure of dispersion helps capture how broadly based price pressures are Headline inflation being driven by one or two itemssay the cost of a restaurant mealis less worrisome than if the price of everything is going up quickly We divide a country consumer-goods basket into as many as 16 components then calculate the share where the inflation rate exceeds 2% In Japan just a quarter cross that threshold But in Australia more than two-thirds do JPMorgan Chase a bank breaks down Britain consumer-price index into 85 components and finds that inflation rates for 69% of them are running above their 1997-2019 averagesInflation could also spiral if workers demand higher wages to compensate them for rising prices and firms raise their prices in turn Unit labour costs which measure the relationship between what workers are paid and the value of what they produce are rising far faster than their long-run average in many countries On May 5th America statisticians revealed that these rose by 7% in the first quarter compared with a year ago up from a pre-pandemic average of around 2% Michael Saunders of the Bank of England has noted that with pay deals being struck at up to 5% a year but productivity growth of only around 1% Britain unit-labour-cost growth is probably “well above the pace consistent with the inflation target [of 2%]”Our last two measures assess households’ expectations The higher these remain the more likely it is that inflation becomes embedded One proprietary data set provided to The Economist by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Morning Consult a consultancy and Raphael Schoenle of Brandeis University is a rare reliable cross-country gauge of public inflation expectations In May 2021 a respondent in the median rich country thought inflation over the next 12 months would be 23% Now they expect a rate of 45%; Canadians an even higher 6% A measure of Google searches also suggests the subject is weighing on people minds Britons now search more frequently for “inflation” than they do for Taylor Swift For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 14th 2022,Digital payments have gone viral in Brazil,FOR YEARS Brazilians had little incentive to abandon cash Wiring 50 reais $10 to a friend would set you back an extra 16; swiping a credit card 2% of the cost of your purchase For e-commerce firms this made doing business particularly cumbersome Customers wanting to buy something online but not wanting to incur the costs of a digital payment could choose instead to print a payment slip boleto take that slip to a shop or post office and hand over the cash The problem for e-commerce firms however was that not everyone who printed a boleto ended up going to a shop to fork over the cashmeaning that many transactions were never completedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThen came Pix an instant-payments system operated by the central bank Launched in November 2020 it has transformed the way Brazilians make payments The platform allows consumers and merchants to send and receive money via a QR code without having to share details of their wallet fintech provider or bank In April around 118m people used the platformor more than two-thirds of Brazilian adults In the last quarter of 2021 they made a staggering 39bn payments Already Pix has surpassed debit and credit cards as the most popular method of payment in Brazil One in five transactions now takes place on the platform mobile appAs an idea Pix is not new or unique India Unified Payments Interface UPI began life in 2016 Other countries have established similar schemes Nonetheless Pix has been a remarkable success For years the central bank sought to make Brazil financial system more competitive digital and inclusive Pix has helped achieve those aims Its rapid adoption could also contain lessons for othersSeveral factors explain why Pix has been so popular For a start it is easy to use Setting up an account takes a matter of minutes A user identifying “key” can be a CPF a sort of tax ID a phone number or a randomly generated string of digits Sending money to recipients at another bank is quick and painlessPolicymakers also acted to encourage adoption Unlike its Mexican counterpart whose Pix equivalent has been less successful Brazil central bank compelled big banks and fintech firms to join its platform During the covid-19 pandemic it mandated that emergency payments made by the government should also be available through the app In this way up to 30m unbanked Brazilians received a cashless payment for the first timeMost payments are of small value and take place between individuals The ubiquity of Pix is such that beggars often ask for money with a QR code These transactions are possible because they are so cheap Pix is free to use for individuals and is by far the lowest-cost option for firmsThe introduction of Pix has had a mixed effect on the country banks Current-account service fees charged by Brazil five biggest lenders were almost 27bn reais lower in 2021 than the year before But banks insist that Pix also presents them with opportunities For one thing as society goes cashless they are spending less on transporting lorryloads of banknotes And although it is not necessary to have a bank account to use Pix the platform seems to encourage people to open one According to Mastercard a credit-card giant Brazil reduced its unbanked population by as much as 73% during the pandemic There are now more potential customers to sell credit products to says Julio Paixão of Bradesco one of the big five banksOne of the biggest surprises is that despite the astronomical success of Pix the number of credit-card transactions has continued to grow Pix is not just serving as a substitute for other cashless payment methods but increasing themThere have been some unforeseen problems Since Pix has been introduced the number of “lightning kidnappings” has surged as criminals forced users to transfer large sums of money In response Pix has introduced a night-time limit on transactions Staff at the central bank have been on strike on and off since early April raising concerns about the operability of the system Others worry about the possibility of a data breach though so far there do not seem to have been any By and large however shortcomings are being rapidly addressedThe central bank has plans for further expansion By the end of this year Pix should be available offline and further integrated into open banking a system that allows customers to share their transaction data with fintechs Soon there will be an option to pay for things in instalments And in the coming years there are plans to make the app available abroad which would facilitate remittances and other cross-border paymentsThe success of platforms such as Pix may have far-reaching implications Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements the central bank for central banks considers them “a huge leap” towards the adoption of central bank digital currencies CBDCs A retail CBDC requires a register of users and their real names and a full record of who pays what to whom and when he explains With Pix you have all that already as well as the technical standards that govern the exchange of information; it is 80% of the way to a CBDC he reckons Brazil central bankers who are working on a CBDC of their own seem inclined to agree The Pix revolution could be just the beginning For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 May 14th 2022,China extraordinary export boom comes to an end,LAST MONTH a yellow-striped freight train rumbled into Budapest carrying solar-power equipment air-conditioning kit and other bits and pieces It had travelled for 16 days all the way from Shandong a province in eastern China As part of China Belt and Road Initiative freight trains now serve more than 50 cities in Europe and Asia from Shandong They are called “Qilu” trains a nod to the ancient Qi and Lu kingdoms that flowered in that part of China in the Confucian eraListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina exports whether by rail road sea or air have made rapid progress in the past two years They rose by almost 30% in dollar terms in 2021 Over 5000 Qilu trains have left the station since 2018 But in April China export growth slowed to a desultory chug In dollar terms exports were only 39% higher than a year earlierEven that modest increase was something of a miracle It came despite China increasingly surreal battle against covid-19 which has locked down Shanghai one of the country biggest trade hubs and imposed onerous restrictions on mobility elsewhere According to Nomura a bank stringent limits remain in 41 cities accounting for almost 30% of GDP Towns have been so anxious to avoid outbreaks that officials have sealed lorry drivers into their cabs while they wait to pick up cargo at motorway checkpoints These kinds of precautions have also gummed up international trade In mid-April 506 vessels were waiting outside Shanghai port according to Windward a shipping-analytics firm compared with 260 in FebruaryOptimists had hoped that China export machine could weather occasional outbreaks of the Omicron variant Workers they pointed out could isolate themselves on the job living where they work in a so-called “closed loop” But no modern factory is entirely self-contained; every “closed” loop must remain open to its suppliers And if any loop in the supply chain succumbs to the virus it can disrupt production in all of them Tesla car production in Shanghai has for example been hampered by a shortage of wiring harnesses from a virus-hit supplier according to Reuters a news agencyTo increase trade by any amount in these conditions is impressive But the headline 39% expansion reported by China customs agency on May 9th was more nominal than real More detailed statistics published later in the month are likely to show that the price of China exports rose by perhaps 8% or more in April compared with a year earlier according to UBS a bank If so the volume of China exports must have shrunk last monthThese price increases have raised fears that a locked-down China will exacerbate inflation in its trading partners particularly America The alarm is often exaggerated Goods made in whole or in part in China made up less than 2% of American personal consumer spending in 2017 according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco China covid-related bottlenecks could have larger ripple effects say by allowing rival manufacturers to raise their prices Most American inflation however is made in AmericaIndeed China exports may be more a victim of America woes than a cause of them America slowdown is contributing to weaker demand for China goods on top of self-inflicted disruptions to their supply Surveys of purchasing managers have revealed falling export orders every month so far this year And China official statistics showed declining exports last month of the computers and household appliances that were in such high demand when the West too was locking itself downNot everything is slowing however China imports from Russia have continued to grow since Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine as sanctions have hindered Russia access to Western markets The offerings included 50 carriage-loads of barley carried to Shandong province on a Qilu train For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 14th 2022,Which housing markets are most exposed to the coming interest-rate storm?,STOCKS ARE sinking a cost-of-living crisis is in full swing and the spectre of global recession looms But you wouldn’t know it by looking at the rich world housing markets many of which continue to break records Homes in America and Britain are selling faster than ever House prices in Canada have soared by 26% since the start of the pandemic The average property in New Zealand could set you back more than NZ$1m $640000 an increase of nearly 46% since 2019Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor more than a decade homeowners benefited from ultra-low interest rates Now however changes are brewing On May 5th the Bank of England having forecast that inflation in Britain could exceed 10% later this year raised its policy rate for the fourth time to 1% The day before America Federal Reserve had increased its benchmark rate by half a percentage point and hinted that more tightening would follow Investors expect the federal funds rate to rise above 3% by early 2023 more than triple its current level Most other central banks in the rich world ranging from Canada to Australia have either started pressing the monetary brakes or are preparing to do soMany economists believe that a 2008-style global property crash is unlikely Households’ finances have strengthened since the financial crisis and lending standards are tighter Scarce housing supply together with robust demand high levels of net household wealth and strong labour markets should also support property prices But the rising cost of money could make homeowners’ existing debt burdens difficult to manage by increasing their repayments while putting off some prospective buyers If that hit to demand is big enough prices could start to fallHomeowners’ vulnerability to sharp rises in mortgage payments varies by country In Australia and New Zealand where prices jumped by more than 20% last year values have got so out of hand that they may be sensitive to even modest rises in interest rates In America and Britain where markets are a little less torrid interest rates may have to approach 4% for house prices to fall reckon analysts at Capital Economics a consultancyAlongside price levels three other factors will help determine whether the housing juggernaut simply slows or comes crashing to a halt: the extent to which homeowners have mortgages rather than own their properties outright; the prevalence of variable-rate mortgages instead of fixed-rate loans; and the amount of debt taken on by householdsConsider first the share of mortgage-holders in an economy The fewer homeowners who own their properties outright the greater the impact of a rate rise is likely to be Denmark Norway and Sweden have relatively high shares of mortgage-holders see table A relaxation of lending standards in response to the covid-19 pandemic turbocharged borrowing In Sweden tax breaks for homeowners have further fuelled the rush to secure mortgages while a dysfunctional rental market characterised by overpriced and illegal subletting has pushed more tenants into home ownership All this puts Nordic banks in a tricky position In Norway and Sweden housing loans make up more than a third of banks’ total assets In Denmark they account for nearly 50% of lenders’ books Sharp falls in house prices could trigger lossesHome and dryBy contrast with the Nordics where home ownership has been fuelled by the growth of mortgage markets many households in central and eastern European countries bought homes without taking on debt in the 1990s because property was so cheap In Lithuania and Romania more than four-fifths of households are outright owners Mortgage-free households are also more prevalent in southern Europe notably Spain and Italy where inheritance or family support is a common route to home ownership Germans for their part are more likely to rent than own their homes Rate rises will consequently have less direct impact on pricesThe structure of mortgage debtthe second factoralso matters Rising interest rates will be felt almost instantly by borrowers on variable rates which fluctuate with changes in policy rates; for those on fixed rates the pain will be delayed In America mortgage rates tend to be fixed for two or three decades In Canada nearly half of home loans have rates that are set for five or more years By contrast lending in Finland is almost entirely priced at floating rates In Australia around four-fifths of mortgages are tied to variable ratesJust looking at the proportion of borrowers on fixed versus variable rates can mislead however In some countries mortgage rates may often be fixed but for a period that is too short to protect borrowers from the interest-rate storm In New Zealand fixed-rate mortgages make up the bulk of existing loans but nearly three-fifths are fixed for less than a year In Britain nearly half the fixed-rate stock is for up to two yearsResilience to rising rates will also depend on the quantum of debt taken on by householdsour third factor High indebtedness came into sharp focus during the global financial crisis As property prices fell households with towering mortgage repayments relative to their incomes found themselves squeezed Today households are richerbut many are saddled with more debt than ever While Canadians added C$36trn $28trn to their combined pile of savings during the pandemic buoying their net wealth to a record C$159trn at the end of 2021 their ravenous appetite for homes has pushed household debt to 137% of income The share of new mortgages with extreme loan-to-income ratios ie exceeding 45 has also risen prompting Canada central bank to issue a warning about high levels of indebtedness in November last yearFinancial regulators in Europe are equally worried In February the European Systemic Risk Board warned of unsustainably high mortgage debt in Denmark Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway and Sweden In Australia homeowners’ average debt as a share of income has swollen to 150% In all these countries households will face heftier monthly repayments just as soaring food and energy costs eat into their incomesAll shapes and sizesBring this together and some housing markets seem set for more pain than others Property in America which bore the brunt of the fallout from the subprime-lending crisis appears better insulated than many large economies Borrowers and lenders there have become more cautious since 2009 and fixed rates are much more popular Housing markets in Britain and France will fare better in the short term but look exposed if rates rise further Property in Germany and southern and eastern Europe appears less vulnerable By contrast prices may be most sensitive to rate rises in Australia and New Zealand Canada and the NordicsOne floor for house prices is that in most countries demand still vastly outstrips supply Strong job markets hordes of millennials nearing home-buying years and a shift to remote working have all increased the demand for more living space New properties remain scarce which will sustain competition for homes and help keep prices high In Britain there were 36% fewer property listings in February compared with the start of 2020; in America there were 62% fewer listings in March than the year beforeNor does the alternative to owning a homerentinglook particularly attractive Across Britain average rents were 15% higher in April than in early 2020 In America they rose by a fifth in 2021 with bigger rises in hotspots such as Miami where they jumped by almost half Rent controls cause a different sort of pain Prospective tenants of such properties in Stockholm face an average waiting time of nine yearsAs the era of ultra-cheap money comes to an end then demand for housing is not about to collapse Yet one way or another renters and homeowners will face an intensifying squeeze Correction May 23rd: An error in the table has been corrected The second column shows the share of households with a mortgage not the share of homeowners with a mortgage SorryFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 13th 2022,Russia is on track for a record trade surplus,WITHIN DAYS of Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine Russia financial system seemed on the verge of collapse The West imposed a range of financial sanctions notably on the Russian central bank foreign-exchange reserves that sent the rouble plunging and led citizens to withdraw cash frantically Then the central bank raised interest rates imposed capital controls and injected liquidity into the banking system and some of these misfortunes reversed Although a chunk of Russia currency reserves remains frozen the country still generates about $1bn a day from its energy exportsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia has stopped publishing detailed monthly trade statistics But figures from its trading partners can be used to work out what is going on They suggest that as imports slide and exports hold up Russia is running a record trade surplusOn May 9th China reported that its goods exports to Russia fell by over a quarter in April compared with a year earlier while its imports from Russia rose by more than 56% Germany reported a 62% monthly drop in exports to Russia in March and its imports fell by 3% Adding up such flows across eight of Russia biggest trading partners we estimate that Russian imports have fallen by about 44% since the invasion of Ukraine while its exports have risen by roughly 8%Imports have collapsed partly because sanctions on the Russian central bank and the expulsion of some lenders from the SWIFT interbank messaging network have made it harder for consumers and firms to buy Western goods Elina Ribakova of the Institute of International Finance IIF a bankers’ group says that regulatory uncertainty was also a big factor at first as Western firms were unsure which Russian banks came under sanctions Logistical disruptions including decisions by Western firms to suspend deliveries to Russia mattered too The early depreciation of the rouble also dampened Russian demand for imports says Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics a consultancyRussia exports meanwhile have held up surprisingly well including those directed to the West Sanctions permit the sale of oil and gas to most of the world to continue uninterrupted And a spike in energy prices has boosted revenues furtherAs a result analysts expect Russia trade surplus to hit record highs in the coming months The IIF reckons that in 2022 the current-account surplus which includes trade and some financial flows could come in at $250bn 15% of last year GDP more than double the $120bn recorded in 2021 That sanctions have boosted Russia trade surplus and thus helped finance the war is disappointing says Mr Vistesen Ms Ribakova reckons that the efficacy of financial sanctions may have reached its limits A decision to tighten trade sanctions must come nextBut such measures could take time to take effect Even if the EU enacts its proposal to ban Russian oil the embargo would be phased in so slowly that the bloc oil imports from Russia would fall by just 19% this year says Liam Peach of Capital Economics a consultancy The full impact of these sanctions would be felt only at the start of 2023by which point Mr Putin will have amassed billions to fund his war For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 12th 2022,The crypto infrastructure cracks,IT HAS BEEN a vicious year for financial markets and more punishing still for crypto assets More than half the market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies has been wiped out since November On May 12th bitcoin traded at around $29000 just 40% of its all-time high in November; ether has slumped by a similar amount The share price of the leading crypto-industry stock Coinbase an exchange is half what it was a week ago falling 26% in a single day after it reported earnings and disclosed that users’ deposits on its platform were not necessarily protected in the event that the firm went bust The sell-off comes at the same time as tech stocks high-yield bonds and other risky assets have swooned as the Federal Reserve has begun raising interest ratesMuch of the technology and the jargon of the crypto-sphere is bewildering still to most people in traditional finance Yet the dynamics of recent days bear the hallmarks of spectacular financial collapses of old Take what has happened to stablecoins a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another currency sometimes a conventional one like the dollar These are part of the plumbing of the crypto system: they act as a bridge between conventional banks where people use dollars and the “on-blockchain” world where people use crypto It is stablecoins’ interaction with traditional finance that has led regulators to fret about the impact they could have on financial stabilityAdded together all stablecoins the largest of which are tether and USD coin operated by Circle are worth around $170bn Terra a smaller stablecoin that had a market capitalisation of $187bn a week ago has unravelled in recent days Even tether peg came under pressure on May 12th The events resemble the confidence crises that have preceded every bank runEvery stablecoin has a mechanism to maintain its peg The simplest and safest method is to hold a dollar in a bank account or in safe liquid assets like Treasury bills for each stablecoin token The token can be traded freely by buyers and sellers; when a seller wants to offload their stablecoin they can either sell it on the open market or redeem it for its dollar value from the issuer USD coin uses this methodOthers like terra are called “algorithmic stablecoins” because they use an automated process to support the peg But their main distinguishing feature is the way in which they are backed Terra is backed with luna a cryptocurrency issued by the same firm that issues terra The theory was that holders of terra could always redeem it for one dollar worth of luna A week ago when luna was trading at $85 a piece that meant a terra holder could redeem it for 00118 lunas The process was managed by a smart contractlines of code that execute automated transactionsthat created more luna when a terra holder wanted to redeem If for some reason terra was trading at less than $1 then arbitrageurs would swoop in buy a terra redeem it for luna and sell them for a profitThat system worked well enough as long as luna had some market value But on May 9th the price of luna began to slide On May 10th it was worth around $30 The following day it fell to less than $150 At present it is trading at about 3 cents As luna fell people began to sell terra tooand arbitrageurs failed to swoop in to save the peg by redeeming their terra for luna instead staying away The terra peg broke and by May 11th had dipped as low as 30 cents before recovering to 40 centsIt is unclear what will happen to terra now Its market cap has sunk to $45bn Its founders have supposedly propped it up by selling off some of the $35bn-worth of bitcoin they had in reserve and are trying to come up with a new way to restore the peg Its unravelling has had wider consequences For one the broken peg put pressure on other stablecoins notably tether the biggest which briefly dipped to 95 cents on May 12th That jeopardises the plumbing of the crypto system as a whole The perception that these assets might not be stable will deter widespread adoption and damage trust in themPerhaps reassuringly for the crypto universe though the flight from stablecoins has not been indiscriminatejust as in bank runs past where depositors would flee the bad banks for the good Holders have sold off terra and tether which has previously been fined by New York Attorney General for misleading investors about the amount and quality of the assets backing its stablecoin But they have seemingly bought tokens perceived to be of higher quality like USD coin which publishes regular audited reports on what backing it holds The trouble with terra did not even upset the other major “algorithmic” stablecoin daiStill the failure of the terra-and-luna system does not come at an auspicious time That the rout in cryptocurrency has troubled stablecoinsa core part of the crypto-financial plumbingmay augur ill for the resilience of the system writ large And there are strains appearing in the traditional financial system The stock and bond market routs have caused some risky issuers to delay planned debt sales citing poor “market conditions” Others could not attract investors even at double-digit yields The era of free money in America has come to an end and cracks are appearing in all kinds of financial marketsFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 7th 2022,Will an ever feebler currency save or sink Japan economy?,T HE LAST time the Japanese yen dipped below 130 to the American dollar in 2002 China economy was smaller than France Vladimir Putin was meeting Western officials with a smile and Eminem a rapper was atop the pop-music charts The yen slide to that abyss first reached on April 28th and then every day since has been precipitous: it stood at just 115 to the dollar at the start of this year Japanese policymakers have begun to fret leading markets to speculate about whether they will intervene to halt the fall That would probably prove futile: deep forces are driving the yen depreciationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe most important one is the widening gap in interest rates between Japan and America see chart While prices have risen sharply in America inflation in Japan has remained below the Bank of Japan BoJ 2% target And though inflation may touch that mark later this year the BoJ reckons it is being fuelled by one-off increases in costs; idiosyncrasies of Japan labour market have meant limited wage growth As a result even as the Federal Reserve has begun tightening rates the BoJ has maintained its ultra-loose stance At a monetary-policy meeting last week the BoJ reaffirmed that direction pledging to keep buying ten-year bonds to help control the yield curve With more money to be made holding American bonds than Japanese ones investors have snubbed the latter dampening demand for the yenTrade also plays a role in the yen woes Japan current-account balance went into the red in December Rising import costs which the Ukraine crisis has made worse have been the main culprit: fuel and raw materials make up roughly one-third of Japan import bill In order to buy pricier foreign goods importers have been forced to sell more yen Japan borders have remained closed to inbound tourism due to the pandemic further weakening Japan balance of paymentsPolicymakers have traditionally seen a weak yen as a positive for Japan and its powerful export-focused industries Some still do They also now hope a bit of cost-push inflation may help to break Japan entrenched deflationary mindset and to force zombie firms out of the market Yet the yen has sunk to such lows that concerns are mounting Consumers are getting squeezed by rising import prices; the government announced another fiscal-stimulus package in April to ease the pain ahead of upper-house elections expected for July Business sentiment has also turned even in the manufacturing sectors says Baba Naohiko of Goldman Sachs an investment bankOne reason is Japanese firms’ gradual but sustained efforts to mitigate the risks of currency appreciation by offshoring production “The flip side” Mr Baba says “is that they can’t reap as many benefits from depreciation” The stuff that is still exported from Japan tends to be high-value-added goods which tend to be less responsive to changes in exchange rates The pandemic and supply-chain snags have also hampered the export of some of these products such as automobilesSome reckon the yen could continue falling perhaps to 150 to the dollar a level unseen even during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 when it fell to 147 to the greenback Inside the BoJ some have argued for shortening the target of the yield-curve control policy from ten-year bonds to five-year ones a form of soft tightening but that seems unlikely in the remainder of the term of the current governor Kuroda Haruhiko which runs until April 2023 A turning point might come when Japan reopens to foreign tourists as expected following the elections Ultimately though argues Jesper Koll of Monex Group a financial-services firm “the yen fall from grace will stop and reverse exactly when Japanese investors begin buying their mother markets” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 May 7th 2022,India begins the privatisation of its huge life-insurance company,IN 1956 AS part of its experiment with embracing socialism India created the Life Insurance Company of India LIC by nationalising and lumping together 245 firms The experiment took a while to conclude In 2000 India allowed private firms to sell life insurance again Two decades later it is selling a 35% sliver of LIC on the public market a first step in what is intended to be a full privatisation Orders will be taken from investors between May 4th and May 9th Trading is due to commence on May 17thListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scale of LIC is such that the sale of even this trivial stake will bring in $27bn making it the fifth-largest public offering of the year globally and the largest in India history One of the reasons stated by the company for such a small percentage being sold is that selling more might crowd out investment in other private and public firms in the country capital-constrained market Out of similar concerns market regulators are already considering waiving a provision that currently requires the dominant shareholder of a listed firm to reduce its ownership stake below 75% within five yearsOnce listed LIC will have a market valuation of around $80bn making it the fifth-most-valuable life insurer in the world Yet more striking is how thoroughly LIC dominates the Indian market Its utter supremacy has no equivalent in any other major country: LIC has a staggering 286m policies in force and collects 64% of all of India written premiums the share of the largest insurer in Britain is 23%; in China it is 21% The firm has $507bn in assets under management triple the amount of its 23 private competitors combinedAlthough such dominance gives the firm and its products unmatched scalea big advantage in an industry that runs on trustthe 659-page listing prospectus makes it clear that there are cracks in LIC armour Premiums have been growing by 9% annually over the past five years a good performance but one that pales in comparison to its Indian competitors many of which have been growing at twice that rateAnd government ties may come with costs Investors have long suspected that LIC is often required to invest at least some of its river of premiums in the interests of the state rather than in the pursuit of profits quietly seeding problems Included in the prospectus 47 pages of risk factors are LIC large investment in IL&FS a government-supported infrastructure-investment fund that went spectacularly bust in 2018 and its majority stake in another formerly government-controlled entity IDBI Bank which it bought as its contribution to a 2019 bail-out Also featured are equity investments purchased over the years for 88bn rupees $115m currently valued at 2bn and debt investments of 113bn rupees 54bn of which are classified as non-performing assetsA public listing and the transparency that must accompany it may alter this approach But concerns about hidden problems and continued interference by the government are worrying investors which helps to explain why the offering is being priced so low Until recently there had been expectations that LIC would be valued at three times its “Indian Embedded Value” an approach based on the present value of future profits derived from expected premiums like most other Indian private insurance firms Instead LIC shares are likely to be sold at only 11 times suggesting buyers have serious reservationsStill in time the most salient detail about the listing may have nothing to do with price and size and everything to do with the fact that it happened at all When the newly reelected administration of Narendra Modi first proposed a public sale of a stake in LIC in early 2020 it was derided as an empty political promise Highly publicised efforts to flog other state-controlled assets most notably Air India had flopped multiple times In October of that year however Air India was finally soldto Tata Group from which it had been seized in 1953 LIC return to the markets after almost as long a gap is not without snags But it suggests a cycle may have genuinely if not entirely come to an end For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 7th 2022,The Fed balance-sheet is about to shrink Wall Street is not ready,CONSIDER THE life of a Treasury bill or bond Typically once or twice a week a batch of fresh Treasuries are born Their first home is usually briefly an investment bank's dealing desk Those dealers might hold on to a few for themselves but generally they distribute the bulk to more permanent owners like the bond portfolios of a mutual fund a foreign government or a company or the Federal Reserve A certain slice will swap hands repeatedlysome $700bn or so are traded each business daybut many will stay put for their lifetimes Their deaths are predetermined: they come of age or “mature” as little as one month or as long as 30 years after their birth at which point they are settled and cease to existListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Fed is the single largest holder of Treasuriesits balance-sheet is where many of those securities have found their permanent home Thanks to bond-buying schemes put in place to ease monetary conditions during the pandemic the Fed now holds some $58trn-worth of Treasuries a quarter of the $232trn-worth the government has issued see chartit also holds $27trn-worth of mortgage-backed securities On May 4th however Jerome Powell the chairman of the Fed said it would start shrinking this giant portfolio a process known as “quantitative tightening” QT in June The reversal could spark a repeat of the temporary yet troubling breakdowns that the world most important financial market has suffered in recent yearson a bigger scaleAccording to the policy statement released on May 4th the Fed will reduce its balance-sheet not by actively making sales but by letting bonds that have reached the end of their lives mature without buying a new bill or bond to replace them By September if all has gone to plan the Fed portfolio will be shrinking by $95bn a month split between $60bn of Treasuries and $35bn of mortgage-backed bonds At that pace the Fed balance-sheet will shrivel by more than $1trn over the next year That is “quite the clip” says Darrell Duffie of Stanford UniversityThere are two reasons why investors and policymakers are watching QT closely The first is its potentially vast impact on monetary policy Estimates of the effect of bond-buying on the cost of money varybut any downward pressure on interest rates exerted as the Fed bought up Treasuries is likely to be reversed as its holdings start to ebb Two-year Treasury yields have already climbed from 08% in January 2022 to 27% as investors have come to expect quicker balance-sheet shrinking and faster rate increases On May 4th Mr Powell announced a 50-basis-point rate rise the first increase of that size since 2000 and signalled more would be “on the table at the next couple of meetings”It is also possible that QT will cause the Treasury market to malfunctionthe second reason for concern Its smooth running matters well beyond America: Treasury rates are a crucial benchmark for pricing virtually all other financial assets globally And recent history is not encouraging A series of episodesincluding the “flash rally” of 2014; stress in the repo market a key money market where Treasuries can be swapped for cash in September 2019; and the covid-19 shock of March 2020 in which the Treasury market in effect ceased to function for periods of timehave created serious doubts about how robust the Treasury market isEach of the episodes had slightly different causes Regardless of the robustness of the Treasury market there was little that would have stopped the extreme nature of the covid-19 shock from rocking it The repo crisis was in part the result of some perverse incentives caused by post-crisis regulation that deterred banks from holding Treasuries But both were exacerbated by a deeper issue says Randal Quarles a former vice-chair for supervision at the Fed which is that the Treasury market “has grown out of its waist size”A combination of financial-crisis stimulus fiscal deficits under President Trump and pandemic-era splurge have caused the Treasury market to grow nearly five-fold since 2007 At the same time fresh regulation imposed on investment banks which are the main conduits in Treasury markets such as the introduction of the supplemental-leverage ratio which measures the total size of bank assets relative to the amount of capital they hold has restricted their ability to facilitate Treasury-market activity The rule is not very friendly to low-risk activities such as holding Treasuries A report released last year by the Group of Thirty an economics advisory body warned that “the aggregate amount of capital allocated to market-making by bank-affiliated dealers has not kept pace” with its lightning growthTo combat issues that have cropped up in the past the Fed has taken measures to increase liquidity such as opening up a “standing facility” for selected intermediaries to swap Treasuries for cash But few think that this is a panacea for dysfunction Mr Duffie favours replacing the current market structure which relies on broker-dealers with a central-clearing system This would make it easier for market participants to interact directlyfor one mutual fund say to sell to another without relying on a bank to intermediate the transaction But the fix would be no match for “the scale of the problem” says Mr Quarles A more urgent task he argues is to loosen the regulatory shackles hampering investment banks from supporting the market That is unlikely to happen soon: there is little appetite in Washington for weakening bank regulationIn the absence of an obvious fix the unknowable fallout from the Fed pull-out is adding to the uncertainty created by rising rates stagflation and geopolitical ructions Liquidity in the Treasury market is already thinning: the “yield error” captured by the Bloomberg Treasury liquidity index which measures the difference between the yield a Treasury is traded at and a measure of fair value is 12% higher than it was in January It has more than doubled since August 2021 The growing possibility of renewed dysfunction could deter investors from dealing further making it yet likelier that the market seizes up The once-placid life of Treasury bills and bonds could get more chaotic for a while For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 May 7th 2022,Why long-term economic growth often disappoints,FROM THE point of view of the 1950s America economic progress over the 70 years that followed has been a huge disappointment Futurists foresaw a world of super-pills space farms and cities encased in glass Science and technology would engineer unending riches and everything consumers could ever want Yet the speed of gains achieved during the Space Age it turned out soon ebbed: between 2000 and 2019 America real income per head grew by 12% a year on average down from 2% between 1980 and 1999 and 25% in the 1950s And instead of flying cars Peter Thiel a venture capitalist once jibed “we got 140 characters”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA new paper suggests such disappointment is not warrantedbecause it stems from an equally huge misunderstanding of how economic progress happens Thomas Philippon a professor of finance at New York University argues the post-war experience was unusual Looking at American data going back to 1890 and British data from 1600 to 1914 he finds that when technological progress is properly understood the world has been on broadly the same path for centuries In the grand scheme of things in other words there has been no slowdown at allMost economists’ starting point for thinking about growth is Robert Solow 1956 paper “A contribution to the theory of growth” Mr Solow model for predicting a country long-term wealth relies on what he dubs the “production function” It is a mathematical black box: on one side labour and capital go in; out the other come all the consumer goods and services that contribute to people standard of living One way of growing is obvious: shove more labour and capital into the box But that cannot deliver improvements for ever Adding more labour means the output is divided between more workers And capital wears out so more investment is needed over time just to stay putInstead long-term growth can only come from improving the black boxthe way in which labour and capital are combined The fancy name economists give to this is total factor productivity TFP though they sometimes refer to it with more intuitive labels such as technology or knowledge You might think of it as a recipe On one side lie labour and capital the ingredients On the other is the finished dish: economic output TFP is an attempt to measure how effective the recipe is at combining the ingredients which in turn depends on factors including the level of education on offer to the population the quality of business management and the depth of scientific know-howMr Solow assumed that the annual contribution of TFP to GDP would grow exponentially This may have been for purely mathematical reasons: he wanted his model economy to grow at a fixed rate of say 2% a year which required ever larger gains as GDP got bigger to keep the pace of growth constant Later economists including Paul Romer like Mr Solow a Nobel prizewinner have tried to work out the chemistry underpinning TFP presumed exponential growth Their theories usually contend that some investment goes not into capital but into research and development And because knowledge can be freely copied they observe this investment has an increasing marginal product meaning that each prior bit of research makes the next bit of research more effective Knowledge thus cascades out creating more knowledge as it does akin to how a virus spreads in the early stage of an epidemicThe problem according to Mr Philippon is that TFP does not actually grow exponentially Using the most popular data sources for long-term growth he compares predictions from two different models to observed trends in TFP A linear patternwhich he calls “additive growth”consistently fits better with how progress has actually unfolded Contrary to existing theories that suggests previous research does not make the next idea any easier to find It also explains why as Mr Philippon puts it some economists keep predicting some future wave of innovation that just never comesThis is not a counsel of despair While the rate of growth in percentage terms may be slowing Mr Philippon model predicts that the size of any increment is roughly constant Societies do get richerbut just not as fast as generally thoughtEncouragingly Mr Philippon also finds evidence of moments when the rate of TFP growth does temporarily accelerate and the annual increment gets higher His paper plots one such moment in Britain between 1650 and 1700 and another around 1830 consistent with when historians date the first and second Industrial Revolutions He also finds one in America around 1930 which he credits to the adoption of electrification Such moments only seem to take place about every century or so But they do help to explain Mr Solow mistake: it would have been easy for him as he was living through one of these periods of acceleration to fall for the illusion of exponential progressThe ways of growth are inscrutableMr Philippon statistical analysis does not speak to TFP deeper conceptual problems One is that capital is hard to value There is usually a difference between its historical cost suitably depreciated and the discounted value of the profits it will eventually produce Unlike labour which can be quantified in hours there is no non-monetary unit with which to value oil rigs and pharmaceutical patents alike After Mr Solow 1956 paper came out a group of economists at the University of Cambridge showed that its method for valuing capital was circular a point Mr Solow followers conceded But the model is still widely used regardlessSimilar problems bedevil TFP itself Statistical techniques that try to measure the concept of “knowledge” typically bundle all the variation in growth that cannot be explained by changes in the workforce or investment into the black box Hence TFP other less flattering namethe “Solow residual” Rather than a reliable metric of society level of knowledge TFP so far seems to remain in the words of a Solow critic a “measure of our ignorance” Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How would an energy embargo affect Germany economy?

Most European buyers have already ruled out paying directly in roubles But Moscow is offering a compromise Buyers would open two accounts with Gazprombank a lender that is not under sanctions They would pay euros into the first and ask the bank to convert the sum into roubles and deposit the money into the second account which would then be wired to GazpromMany European countries dislike the plan which would look as though they were giving in to Russian bullying and risks creating legal headaches They will fall into three groups One which includes Belgium Britain and Spain imports little or no gas directly from Russia and may refuse to compromise Another group includes big buyers such as Germany and Italy which will struggle to replace imports quickly; they may take the deal A third set of waverers includes countries that are only partially dependent on Russia and may also have contracts that are soon to expireEven this situation would create uncertainty One country being cut off could have knock-on effects on others for instance if gas transits through it to other places Nor is it clear who will take the Russian compromise or whether Russia might eventually turn the taps off anywayIf Germany say were cut off gas markets would go haywire European prices are already six times higher than they were a year ago They would soar to new peaks luring more LNG from the rest of the world and causing prices elsewhere to rise in turn Jack Sharples of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies a think-tank reckons a full shutdown of Russian gas to Europe may well cause a global recession Russia game of poker is getting scarierand those losing their shirts could include bystanders too For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

 Apr 30th 2022,Are emerging economies on the verge of another “lost decade”?,EMERGING ECONOMIES hoping to grow their way into the ranks of the rich have faced a seemingly never-ending series of setbacks in recent years Trade tensions a pandemic supply-chain snarls inflation and war have together dealt them serious blows Over the past three years more than half the population of the emerging world lived in countries where income growth in purchasing-power-parity terms lagged behind that in Americathe first such episode since the 1980sListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe IMF forecasts that economic output across emerging markets will expand by 38% this year and 44% in 2023 Both figures have been revised down sharply since last year and fall short of the 5% average annual rate in the decade before covid-19 As the contours of the post-pandemic landscape start to come into focus a lost decade for the world poorer countriesa period of slow growth recurring financial crises and social unrestlooks increasingly plausibleEmerging economies have experienced many ups and downs before In the 1960s and 1970s they enjoyed rapid growth which fed optimism about the prospects for the world poor But the good times were followed by what William Easterly of New York University described as the lost decades of the 1980s and 1990s Over the ten years to 1990 annual growth in GDP per person in the median emerging economy fell below zero see chart From the late 1990s onwards a new boom began which reset expectations about the economic potential of the developing world More recently though the pendulum has swung back again and growth has proved harder to come by Emerging markets face structural impediments such as tougher financial-market conditions and changing trade patterns reminiscent of those that confronted them in the 1980s and 1990sFinancial pressures pose the most acute threat In the early 1980s the Federal Reserve raised interest rates dramatically as it sought to tame inflation For poor economies that had borrowed heavily in the preceding years the ensuing tightening in financial conditions and strengthening of the dollar were too much to bear Waves of debt and banking crises followedSome of those conditions seem familiar today Both public and private debt in the emerging world rose steadily as a share of GDP during the 2010s and rocketed during the pandemic Public-debt ratios across middle-income economies now stand at record highs and indebtedness in the poorest countries has risen towards the debilitating levels of the 1990s Of the world 70-odd low-income countries more than 10% including Chad and Somalia already face unsustainable debt burdens Another 50% including Ethiopia and Laos are at high risk of being in a similar position according to the World Bank A decade ago only about a third of poor countries were in or at high risk of debt distressRussia invasion of Ukraine has fuelled surges in food and energy costs Wheat and oil are both about 50% more expensive than they were a year ago For importing countries this increases the fiscal costs of food and energy subsidies drains hard-currency reserves and weighs on economic growth Rising prices also intensify pressure on central banks in the rich world to tighten monetary policy Investors expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by nearly three percentage points in 2022; that would be the largest rate rise in a single year since the early 1990s Add in the effect of a shrinking Fed balance-sheet and the tightening this year could be the most dramatic since the 1980sMarkets are already heaping pressure on vulnerable emerging economies As capital flows to America to take advantage of higher rates the dollar is strengthening: it is up by more than 10% over the past year Funding costs in the emerging world are rising with it The yield on the hard-currency debt of the median emerging economy has risen by more than a third since the summer The share of issuers with bonds trading at distressed levels has more than doubled to just over a fifth according to the IMF That includes Ukraine as well as Egypt and GhanaMore countries will probably follow the lead of Sri Lanka which on April 12th defaulted on its hard-currency government debt Nonetheless the systemic crises that were a feature of the previous lost decades may be avoided Many middle-income economies have bolstered their financial defences since the 1980s by beefing up foreign-exchange reserves for instance Investors have become more discerning reducing the risk of wider contagion The bigger worry instead is that debt loads will hit growth by limiting governments’ room to cut taxes and invest in education and infrastructure Local banks that have lent heavily to governments may find their capacity to lend to private borrowers impaired if the bonds they hold lose value Home-country government debt now makes up about 17% of bank assets across emerging economies up from 13% in the early 2010s and well above the 75% average in rich countriesAnother headwind comes from global trade Developing economies’ fortunes have long risen and fallen in line with it From 1960 to 1980 goods trade as a share of world GDP doubled from 9% to 18%; during the lost decades by contrast it stagnated Trade then soared again as global supply chains expanded across East and South-East Asia in particular But that interconnectedness is once more at risk Geopolitical tensions national campaigns for self-sufficiency and concerns about supply-chain reliability may weigh on trade reducing poor economies’ opportunities to borrow technology and know-how from foreign firms and sell to the rich worldThe global economy will also suffer from the sputtering of the largest emerging market of them all and the world primary growth engine: China Between 1970 and 2000 America and Europe accounted for nearly half of global GDP growth The sharp and sustained slowdown in rich-world growth that began in the 1970s thus weighed heavily on the global economy and the prospects for the emerging world Fortunes turned in the 2000s however as an explosive expansion in China led it to contribute more to global growth than America and Europe combined A modest deceleration in China to GDP growth rates of around 5% would not doom the global economy to stagnation Draconian covid lockdowns a protracted property-market bust and the potential costs of geopolitical misadventures however could do great damageSome emerging markets stand to benefit from an era of stagnation Firms wary of dependence on China could move production to other low-cost places Rich countries hoping to prevent poorer ones from drawing closer to Russia and China could lower trade barriers and increase investment abroad boosting growth prospects in the process High commodity prices while they last will buoy the fortunes of food energy and metals exportersOverall however the higher debts and forgone investment in human and physical capital of the past few years will take a heavy toll The IMF forecasts that GDP across the emerging world will remain some 5% below its pre-pandemic trend at the end of 2024 By comparison GDP in most of the rich world is expected to be less than 1% below trend Without bold initiatives to lower debt burdens invest in public goods and expand trade such mediocre performance might be just a taste of what is to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 30th 2022,A divergence in consumer surveys adds to recession worries for America,AMERICANS HAVE much to like and much to dislike about the economy these days Thanks to a red-hot labour market it is unusually easy both to find work and negotiate a pay increase At the same time rising prices have taken a bite out of their earnings in real terms To get a handle on how people perceive these opposing trends analysts can look at surveys that measure consumers’ sentiment about the economy There is however a problem at the moment Like the contradictory trends the two main surveys are presenting different picturesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe first is a survey of consumers by the University of Michigan Started in 1946 it is respected as a leading indicator of whether Americans are planning to spend money or tighten their belts As such it is looking grim The preliminary reading for April was near its lowest point in more than a decadeand crucially was 26% lower than its level a year earlier Falls this sharp are often associated with recessionsThe other survey is the Conference Board gauge of consumer confidence Established in 1967 it is an equally respected snapshot of the American consumer And it is markedly more upbeat A sub-index measuring what consumers think about the present situation is near its highest level since the start of the pandemic though a separate sub-index measuring their expectations is far more subduedThe divergence between the two surveys can largely be explained by their different focuses Both consist of five questions but of a very different kind Two of the questions in the Michigan survey ask respondents about their personal finances and one asks whether they think it a good time to make a big household purchase such as a television These questions are likely to pick up current concerns about inflation The Michigan survey asks nothing about personal job prospects By contrast two of the five questions in the Conference Board survey are specifically about employment conditions Its survey is in other words calibrated to pick up the current optimism about the labour marketUnfortunately for the American economy the rosier Conference Board survey does not simply cancel out the gloomier Michigan alternative Such a big divergence is itself a signal Economists at Deutsche Bank say that compared with the Michigan survey the Conference Board measure tends to be dominated by lagging indicators that perform well late in the cycle making the spread between the current-conditions gauge in the two surveys their favourite indicator of cyclical consumer sentiment It is flashing red today with the gap close to its widest in more than half a century At such a level it signals that the probability of a recession is around 50% over the next yearroughly twice as high as many economists currently estimate Whatever the true figure is it seems clear that consumers are feeling a pinch from inflation and are increasingly anxious about the near future despite benefiting from a strong jobs market todayEconomists look at many other indicators beyond surveys of consumers of course Financial conditions particularly the shrinking gap between yields on long-dated Treasuries and shorter-term bonds are another portent of slower growth Orders for durable goods by contrast point to resilience Ultimately all these indicators confirm what is all too evident from past precedents for such a hot economy: that the Federal Reserve will need ample skill and good fortune if it is to tame price pressures without inducing a recession For more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The implications of low investment yields,IN 1988 STEVE GUTTENBERG a comic actor appeared on a British talk show At one point he was asked why he had not appeared in “Police Academy 5” having starred in the earlier films He replied that in his view all the important philosophical questions had been addressed in the first four moviesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis brings us to the more serious business of investing and a sequel of a very different kind Ten years ago Antti Ilmanen a finance whizz published “Expected Returns” a brilliant distillation of investment theory practice and wisdom His latest book “Investing Amid Low Expected Returns” is an update taking in a decade worth of additional research and data Mr Ilmanen has read all the books and papers sorting the good stuff from the junk He has a gift for explaining clearly and concisely the lessons of this research for investors The new book is as invaluable a resource as the old one If it has a fault it is that it does not quite address all the important philosophical questions A sequel may be necessaryStart though with a recap of the expected-returns framework There are two sources of return on an investment: income and capital gain The income on for instance a government bond is the interest or “coupon” paid once or twice a year Bond prices and yields move inversely So when interest rates fall as they did for much of the past four decades bond investors enjoy a capital gain In essence a capital gain of this kind brings forward future returns You get the income now you were going to get later But as yields fall ever lower the scope for further capital gains becomes more limited So low yields imply low expected returns This bond-like logic holds for other assetsequities property private equity and so on Dividend and rental yields have fallen in response to the secular fall in interest rates Owners of all kinds of assets have experienced windfall gains But today low yields imply low expected returns in the futureWhat now? As Mr Ilmanen sees it low expected returns can materialise through either “slow” or “fast” pain In the slow-pain scenario assets remain expensive and investors receive desultory bond coupons equity dividends and rental receipts for years on end In the fast-pain scenario yields revert to their higher historical averages This implies a spell of brutal capital losses followed by fairer returns thereafter The choice is between well-heeled stagnation and a crashMr Ilmanen is too much of an epistemological sceptic to put all his chips on one scenario He is also too careful an analyst to miss that low inflation made the high-asset-price low-yield 2010s what they were Many of the factors that kept a lid on inflation in that decadeglobalisation efficient supply-chain management tight fiscal policy an expanding global workforceare now attenuating or unwinding Mr Ilmanen hunch is that the 2020s will see something of a reversal of the investment trends of the preceding decade But he generally eschews investing on hunchesFaced with lower expected returns investors have three courses of action: they can take more risk to reach for higher returns; they can save more; or they can accept reality and play the hand they have been dealt as well as they can The first approach may increase returns but also makes them more uncertain Saving more means sacrificing today for the sake of tomorrow a highly personal choice Understandably Mr Ilmanen focus is on the third approach He sets out a chapter-by-chapter analysis of various investment assets and styles He advises how to put them together in a truly diversified portfolio Along the way he explains why market timing is a snare you end up taking too little risk; what the true appeal of private equity is not superior returns; and why portfolio insurance will not save you it is too expensive in the long runThere are shortcomings A quarter of the 500+ references are from authors affiliated with AQR Capital Management Mr Ilmanen employer This weighting gives the book a less independent air than “Expected Returns” Readers would have benefited greatly from a chapter on the implications of low expected returns for different sorts of savers The fast-pain scenario for instance is surely preferable for young savers to whom the book is dedicated Perhaps this and other gaps will be filled in “Expected Returns III” Even Mr Guttenberg has been teasing fans with the prospect of “Police Academy 8” The big philosophical questions are never truly settledRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:A requiem for negative government-bond yields Apr 23rdThe complicated politics of crypto and web3 Apr 16thBonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

tangle of complex interactions The breakdown of a seemingly insignificant link in the chain can disrupt firms that are either upstream or downstream of it causing wider damage In a paper published in 2019 David Baqaee of the University of California Los Angeles and Emmanuel Farhi of Harvard University used a model of complex supply networks to study the oil shocks of the 1970s Linkages between firms and sectors meant that the overall economic effect was quite a bit larger than the direct impact on sectors that used oil Recent research on the effect of social distancing on America by Jean-Noël Barrot then of HEC Paris and his co-authors finds that ripple effects through production networks accounted for more than half of the total economic impactAnother much-studied instance of disruption is the earthquake that struck north-eastern Japan in 2011 As the worst-hit areas only accounted for less than a twentieth of GDP local disruption should not have had a noticeable nationwide effect But it did In a review Vasco Carvalho of the University of Cambridge and colleagues disentangle the impact on the affected areas from the ripple effects along supply chains and find that the latter accounted for more than half the hit to Japanese growthResearchers have also uncovered the types of links and mechanisms that enable shocks to propagate widely The shutdown of a company altogether is one way in which a jolt can create a much bigger economic hit according to a paper by Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi of Northwestern University as well as another study by Mr Baqaee That explains why Alan Mulally then the chief executive of Ford a carmaker urged American lawmakers to bail out his competitors during the global financial crisis Ford feared the collapse of the auto sector suppliers which would cause severe disruptions at its own plants tooIntimate commercial relationships such as those within firms tend to be especially affected because they are harder to replace Another study of Japan 2011 earthquake by Christoph Boehm of the University of Texas Austin and others finds that the American subsidiaries of Japanese firms also suffered as did their suppliers Other research also concludes that the more customised the relationship between firms and their suppliers the bigger the ripple effects Mr Barrot and Julien Sauvagnat of Bocconi University examine 30 years of American natural disasters and find that disruption to just one supplier leads to a loss in sales for a downstream firm of two to three percentage points which considering that most suppliers provide a small portion of a firm production inputs is a sizeable fallSuch findings provide fodder for opponents of an energy embargo in Germany And some estimates of the impact of an embargo also suggest that the short-term disruptions could be large Six leading German research institutes conclude that an embargo could lead to a GDP loss for the country of around 1% this year and 5% in 2023 The Bundesbank estimates a hit of 5% in 2022Yet there are two reasons why things need not be so bad For a start just as past experience shows that supply disruptions can have sizeable near-term effects it also shows that the economy in aggregate has a great ability to adjust In 2010 China banned the export of rare-earth metals to Japan one of the world biggest users of the minerals Japanese firms were able to quickly substitute away from previously cheap rare earths and find alternative supplies according to research by Eugene Gholz of the University of Notre Dame and Llewelyn Hughes of the Australian National University In a study of the potential effects of a Russian energy embargo on Europe Rüdiger Bachmann of the University of Notre Dame and his co-authors find that while the hit could be large it would be partly offset by the economy ability to adapt The overall impact they reckon could be in the region of 05-3% of GDPProduction interruptedMoreover it is within the gift of governments to mitigate the short-term pain of supply disruptions EU officials for instance are mulling stricter sanctions on energy imports from Russia The more notice firms receive about the measures which could include a tax on Russian energy the easier adjusting to them is likely to become Past episodes suggest that if policymakers do want to change regulations or trade relationships they should do so consistently and carefully A liberalisation of Indian trade in the 1990s led to little wider disruption because it was gradual helping firms adjust A recent study by Alessandra Peter of New York University and Cian Ruane of the IMF points out that Indian firms were able to find substitutes for inputsGovernments could also take into account the fact that businesses may not do enough to ensure that networks are solid in the near term Matthew Elliott of the University of Cambridge and others find that firms might invest in the robustness of their supply chains if they have a business case to do so But they might not seek to ensure the resilience of the wider network because they do not stand to reap the rewards from such investment Encouraging firms and households to shift away from using fossil fuels as a tariff would do could enhance that resilience Managed well Germany supply disruptions need not

 Apr 23rd 2022,Does high inflation matter?,IT STARTED IN America but the surge in inflation has spread to the rest of the rich world Consumer prices across the OECD club of mostly rich countries are rising by 77% year on year the fastest pace of increase in at least three decades In the Netherlands inflation is nearing 10% even higher than in America while in Estonia it is over 15% How forcefully should central banks respond to the inflationary surge? The answer depends on how much damage inflation is causing And that depends on whom you askListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInflation is regarded as costly because it erodes people savings and distorts price signals And there are unquestionably instances when it has brought an economy to its knees During Weimar Germany period of hyperinflation in the 1920s people savings evaporated eliminating the middle class and paving the way for the rise of fascism Inflation also spiralled out of control in Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe As price signals broke down millions went without foodBut in more moderate inflationary episodes such as the current one the evidence for economic carnage is weaker One common worry is that increases in prices outpace rises in wages causing people real incomes to decline This has almost certainly been happening across rich countries in recent months American real hourly earnings fell by nearly 3% in the year to MarchOn the whole though economists see a tenuous connection between inflation and workers’ real living standards Sometimes prices rise faster than wages; sometimes they do not British real wages grew strongly during the inflationary era of the 1970s According to a study published in 1975 American workers whether unionised or not had seen inflation-busting pay rises in the preceding decade The Economist has looked at data for 35 OECD countries going as far back as 1990 In years when inflation exceeded 5% we find real wages rose on average Inflation can also help the unemployed find jobs even as it hurts people already in work After the global financial crisis of 2007-09 sterling depreciated lifting inflation in Britain and reducing real wages Companies could then afford to hire more workersThe notion that inflation messes with price signals another putative economic cost is also exaggerated at moderate levels Capitalism allocates resources via movements in relative prices: if the price of cars rises compared with that for bicycles more cars should eventually be produced The worry is that inflation disrupts this process making it harder to discern the “true” relative prices of cars and bicyclesIn a paper published in 2018 however Emi Nakamura of the University of California Berkeley and colleagues examine price dispersion for the same sorts of products over time Looking at the period of high inflation in the 1970s they find “no evidence that prices deviated more from their optimal level” than just before the pandemic when inflation was far lower The “strong conclusions about [the] optimality of low inflation rates [in this regard] need to be reassessed” they concludeSophisticated papers such as these back up a broader body of work going back decades that questions the link between inflation and growth A paper published by the IMF in 2014 noted that “few empirical studies have even tried to find costs of single-digit inflation” In 1996 Michael Bruno and William Easterly then both of the World Bank found “no evidence of any relationship between inflation and growth at annual inflation rates less than 40%” The next year Paul Krugman wrote that “even though inflation is universally regarded as a terrible scourge efforts to measure its costs come up with embarrassingly small numbers”So does the rich world current bout of inflation have minimal costs or even none at all? The trouble for economists is that there is a world outside their research Few people know or care about their results But they know what they think about inflation: they utterly implacably loathe itInflation seems to hold a special place in the public consciousness Our analysis of English-language newspapers and blog posts suggests that during the 2010s media organisations mentioned inflation 50% more frequently than they mentioned unemployment even though joblessness during that decade was a far bigger economic problem In the 1990s Robert Shiller of Yale University asked people in a number of countries about their opinions on inflation and compared them with the views of economists He found that ordinary people held much more extreme views on the subject than the academics who study it for a livingPeople believe that inflation makes them poorer They worry it makes it harder to plan And they believe that inflation is a sign that unscrupulous companies are taking advantage of them two-thirds of Americans ascribe the recent rise in inflation to corporate greed Economists by contrast are more equivocal in their answers More than half of Americans “fully agreed” that preventing high inflation was as important as stopping drug abuse or maintaining educational standards compared with just 18% of economists In the same survey Mr Shiller found that 46% of people wanted the government to lower the price level after an inflation spike ie to engineer deflation something few economists would recommendGet realPerhaps policymakers should just ignore the views of ordinary people If experts find that inflation has surprisingly low costs then what more information is needed to guide policy? Another way of looking at it however is that the psychological costs of high inflation are real and that central bankers and governments should take them into account Fighting inflation by forcefully tightening fiscal or monetary policy is often seen as a hard-nosed choice because it cools the economy and risks provoking a recession In fact it is one of the most populist policies out there Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:What bigger military budgets mean for the economy Apr 16thChina has a celebrated history of policy experiments Apr 9thWill dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

 Apr 23rd 2022,China two-front fight to quash the virus and revive its economy,THE FORTUNES of the world second-biggest economy hinge on two kinds of hesitancy The first is over vaccines China elderly are surprisingly reluctant to get inoculated against covid-19 That has saddled the country with a vulnerable population that could die in large numbers if the government abandons its controversial “zero-covid” policy But this uncompromising stance which tries to stamp out any outbreak of the virus obliges China to impose ruinous lockdowns on some of its most productive cities including Shanghai where some residents have been confined to their homes for over 30 daysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThese limits on movement are wreaking economic havoc Even before the worst restrictions were imposed retail sales shrank by 35% year-on-year in March in nominal terms according to figures released on April 18th Catering services fell by more than 16% Unemployment in China 31 biggest cities is now 6% higher than in 2020 points out Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management Overall GDP grew surprisingly fast by 48% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier But that was mostly because of strength in the first two months of the yearThis quarter could look decidedly worse Ting Lu of Nomura a bank thinks GDP could shrink China rulers are not hiding their concern Earlier this month Li Keqiang the prime minister told local authorities that they should show greater “urgency” in stabilising the economyYet a second kind of hesitancy has marked the government response to the slowdown: a reluctance to stimulate the economy as forcefully as in the past On April 15th the People Bank of China PBoC said it would reduce the amount of money that banks must hold in reserve But it cut these requirements by only 025 percentage points for most banks half as much as expected And it has still not lowered its key policy rates since January before the latest covid outbreak took hold Instead this macro-institution has resorted to micro-management issuing no fewer than 23 instructions to encourage lending for particular purposes such as elderly care transport and grain purchasesWhat is holding the PBoC back? It says it will “refrain from a deluge of strong stimulus policies” and “strike a balance between internal and external equilibria” It may worry that the monetary easing required to preserve growth would jeopardise China external balance with the rest of the world In particular the PBoC may fear that capital would flee if it cut interest rates too boldly just as America Federal Reserve raises rates sharply China has already suffered net capital outflows from its equity markets in recent months as Russia invasion of Ukraine forced foreign investors to face up to geopolitical dangers they would rather not contemplateIf China remains hesitant to ease monetary policy more dramatically it must rely on fiscal stimulus But even here it faces impediments and reluctance The finance ministry for example still has a prudish unwillingness to report a big headline budget deficit Hence much of the extra public spending needed to stabilise growth this year will be carried out by local governments and special funds that do not appear in the headline figuresUnfortunately local authorities are themselves under renewed financial scrutiny Last July the banking regulator issued “Document No 15” instructing banks not to increase the hidden debts of local governments These rules were later shelved But the threat of a future crackdown remains Another directive issued by the finance ministry required local governments to pick spending projects more carefully if they wished to finance them with bondsDespite these intrusions local governments probably have enough money as a group reckons Hui Shan of Goldman Sachs a bank They have carried over unspent funds from last year and received transfers from the central government But the money is not evenly spread “Some provinces have projects but no money others have money but no projects” she saysIn those parts of the country battling covid the limits on stimulus may be logistical rather than financial Lockdowns and other restrictions interfere with the manpower and supply chains necessary for public construction projects Fighting covid may also monopolise officials’ attention Yes local officials are being urged to stabilise the economy with “urgency” But they are also being sacked for losing control of the virus That skews incentives towards cutting infections rather than expanding infrastructure It is hard to be a covid hawk and a fiscal doveIt is possible for stimulus to bypass such bureaucracy In America fiscal easing took the form of “stimmy” cheques paid directly to households China lacks an equivalent system for distributing government largesse The next best thing in theory is cutting income taxes which leaves more money in people pockets to spend But as only a minority of Chinese pay income tax such cuts would have little impact The closest alternative is lower taxes on smaller firms some of which are not much more than household operations anyway Thus about a third of fiscal easing this year will take the form of cuts in taxes and fees for small and medium-sized enterprises according to Goldman SachsAgain however covid poses an obstacle The retailers and other small enterprises targeted by these tax cuts are often the same firms hit hardest by lockdowns and other restrictions If the zero-covid policy deprives a firm of its customers relieving it of taxes is scant consolation A company with zero income does not care what tax rate it paysChina may therefore have to wait until this covid wave subsides before it can revive its economy in earnest And even then it must hope that the economic comeback is not immediately halted by another outbreak Until China elderly become less hesitant about vaccines its economy will stay resistant to stimulus For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

When nominal yields on newly purchased bonds were tumbling and inflation was low investors at least saw the benefit of capital gains on their existing holdings bond prices move inversely to yields Now bond investors must suffer both negative real returns on newly bought bonds and a decline in the value of their stock of holdingsSome assets such as American high-yield corporate bonds and some emerging-market corporate debt benefited when investors first searched for yield The recent change in financial conditions complicates the outlook for them High-yield bonds for example are more likely to offer positive real yields But rising interest rates and the higher possibility of recession make those assets riskier too Some emerging-market bonds may gain favour: China is one of the few countries where short-term real interest rates are positive; Brazil Mexico and South Korea issue inflation-linked debt with yields in positive territory But hedging against currency risk could eat up the entire returnEquity in both public and private markets and underlying assets where returns have some sort of link to nominal economic growth rather than to interest rates alone may be more attractive Assets that carry some pricing powersuch as rental property and commodity and infrastructure investmentsare also likely to be favouredEven as nominal bond yields undergo their most dramatic rises in a generation the picture for real yields will remain familiar to investors acquainted with the pressures of the past decade Unless the world big central banks become drastically more hawkish about inflation and engineer an economic recessionmuch as Paul Volcker then the Federal Reserve chairman did in the 1980sthe scramble for real income could prove to be a decisive force in marketsRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The complicated politics of crypto and web3 Apr 16thBonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

 Apr 23rd 2022,New research spells out the benefits of diverse supply chains,OVER THE quarter-century before the pandemic global manufacturing was transformed by the emergence of complex supply chains through which firms could efficiently produce all sorts of goods at low cost and enormous scale The pandemic put these supply chains through the wringer causing wild swings in demand while forcing repeated lockdowns that frustrated both production and distribution The result has been a surge in shipping delays shortages of critical components and soaring pricesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGovernments have become keener to boost domestic production the better to reduce their vulnerability to disruptions in foreign supplies But new work by the IMF suggests that this would be misguided Supply chains held up better during the pandemic than is often assumed it argues and greater self-sufficiency is likely to leave countries more vulnerable to future shocks not lessThe covid recession was unusual Trade in goods fell sharply at its onsetby 12% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to late 2019but then bounced back faster than has been common in recent downturns To better understand these gyrations the fund economists built a model that predicts trade patterns based on levels of spending within economies They found large differences between the amount and type of trade predicted by the model and what actually happened during the pandemica sign of covid-related weirdnessThe virus distorted trade in part through its effects on domestic economies Places that experienced higher caseloads and more restrictive lockdowns imported more goods than expected given the blow to overall GDP for instance That in part reflects a shift in demand away from services and towards goods such as home electronics and protective equipment Covid also interfered with the production of some goods at home which then needed to be imported insteadBut lockdowns in some places also had spillover effects elsewhere During the first half of 2020 the researchers note about 60% of the decline in a country imports could be explained by lockdowns in its trading partners These ripple effects hit goods that were reliant on long supply chains the hardest But the drag was smaller when the places that were locked down had greater capacity to telework And crucially the effect of restrictions declined over time as working patterns and supply chains adapted Exporters in places that ended strict lockdowns earlier saw big gains in market share with bigger increases occurring in the production of supply-chain-intensive goodsA lack of data means that the fund analysis stops in mid-2021 after which a series of unfortunate events from stranded ships to war led to port backlogs and rising costs Nonetheless the fund reckons the model might suggest how best to protect an economy against disruptions The answer is not by reshoring production but by diversification: sourcing inputs from a wider variety of countries and using components that can easily be substituted for if supply problems ariseIn most countries the vast majority of components used to make goods tend to be sourced domestically About 69% of parts in Europe and more than 80% in the western hemisphere are produced at home for example If a firm were to choose to import a critical component instead it would face a more diverse choice: the market share of the average exporting country in the average industry is a little under a third Re shoring would therefore tend to reduce the diversification of a supply chain rather than increase it by making production even more dependent on a single country: the home economy That could prove costly The fund estimates that in the face of a big disruption one that causes a 25% drop in labour supply in a single large producer of critical inputs the average economy could be expected to suffer a fall in GDP of about 1% Greater diversification stands to reduce the damage by about halfEncouraging diversification is a tricky matter The fund suggests that lowering barriers to trade and investing in infrastructure could help Geopolitical tensions sadly mean that openness to deeper integration is in short supply But the gains to be made at least are now clearer For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Apr 23rd 2022,After getting inflation so wrong can the Fed now get it right?,IT WAS A simple stunning admission “We have had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted” said Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve last month Many factors explain the latest burst in inflation with snarled supply chains tight job markets generous fiscal stimulus loose monetary policy and more recently the war in Ukraine all part of the fabric But one thread runs through them all Investors analysts and crucially central bankers believed that high inflation in America had been consigned to history a problem more for academic studies than for current policyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNo one now doubts that inflation is a problem for today Consumer prices rose by 85% in March compared with a year earlier a four-decade high Belatedly the Fed has swung into action As recently as mid-2021 most members of its rate-setting committee believed that it would not raise interest rates at all this year see chart 1 At its meeting in March however Fed officials concluded that they would raise rates by nearly two percentage points in 2022 setting America up for one of its steepest tightening cycles in a quarter of a century How did the Fed get it so wrong? And does its sharp shift mean that it is at last getting it right?Explanations for the Fed mistake fit into three related categories: a failure of imagination a technical trap and institutional inertia In failing to see how bad things might get the Fed was hardly alone When inflation perked up a year ago most analysts and investors pointed to dislocations from the pandemic With people avoiding crowded places demand for goods such as cars and computers had boomed just as companies were struggling to make them As covid-19 faded away so would inflationNot all economists were so optimistic Notable among them was Larry Summers a former treasury secretary In February 2021when prices were still quiescenthe warned that President Joe Biden $19trn covid-relief bill might “set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation” Others including Olivier Blanchard a former chief economist of the IMF and Jason Furman an economic adviser to President Barack Obama added their concerns “At a minimum the Fed should have been much more even-handed in assessing that inflation might come down but that it might also stay high” says Mr Furman Indeed as prices rose interest rates fell in real terms which only added fuel to inflationA common refrain of the Fed critics is that the central bank was caught fighting the last war The recovery from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 was long and drawn out with inflation staying subdued Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton an asset manager thinks this misled the Fed “The idea was that inflation expectations were so well-anchored that a free lunch was available You could have a massive expansion of fiscal and monetary policy and still no impact on inflation” she says This time though the economy was not emerging from a deep financial crisis Rather the pandemic was more akin to a natural disaster from which recoveries tend to be much swifterA more technical explanation for the Fed mistake was its new framework for monetary policy unveiled in August 2020 known as “flexible average inflation targeting” Boiled down the idea was to let the economy run hot to make up for colder periods so that inflation averages 2% over time Bill Dudley a former president of the New York Fed argues that this framework has merit but that its implementation was clumsy The Fed wanted to be certain that inflation would stay above 2% for a while and that the job market was in rude health before lifting rates “The flaw was putting yourself in a position where you tied your hands so you almost had to be late with tightening” says Mr DudleyEven for those more inclined to be forgiving there is concern about how long it took the Fed to alter its course “Committees have inertia” says Adam Posen president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank in Washington “Ideally central banks should be completely shameless about saying ‘oops we made a mistake We’ve got to fix it’ But they’re not” Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says the Fed made it hard for itself with its open-ended asset-buying programme or quantitative easing QE The Fed was nervous about how to halt QE without upsetting markets By contrast the Bank of England had a fixed end point for its QE “Everyone expected it to end on a certain date unless there was big news in a different direction” Ms Forbes saysAt some level the Fed has now corrected its three mistakes It is alert to the reality of inflation; it has in effect shelved its average-inflation framework; and institutional momentum has moved towards tightening so that even its erstwhile doves sound relatively hawkish Alongside a steep path of rate increases the Fed is expected to start shrinking its balance-sheet next month “It is not clear that moving any faster would gain you more credibility or more inflation reduction But it is clear that it would massively increase the likelihood of recession” says Mr Posen As it stands the Fed has never before managed to reduce inflation from such lofty levels without inducing a downturn Mr Powell himself conceded last month that a soft landing would be hard to pull offEven so some still sense over-confidence The median forecast of the Fed rate-setting committee has been branded as “immaculate disinflation”: according to its projections in March inflation is expected to come down to 23% on the Fed preferred gauge in 2024 despite short-term interest rates reaching only 28% Put crudely this implies that real rates will be barely positive and yet inflation will somehow fizzle outMr Dudley says the next test for the Fed may come in 2023 Given the ebbing of pandemic distortions inflation may well tick down over the rest of this year That however will not get America back to an annual inflation rate of 2% Instead it may be closer to 4% with companies still struggling to hire workers in an overheated economy If the Fed lets up at that point in its tightening America could be primed for trouble warns Mr Dudley “Underlying inflationary pressures will gradually drift higher and the Fed will be forced to respond more aggressively later” he says “The risk for a hard landing goes up the more it procrastinates”Mr Furman is less worried thinking the Fed will go further with its tightening if inflation remains uncomfortably high next year “When reality is different from what they think they themselves will make the necessary changes” he says Still he would like the Fed to be clearer now that its tightening “has no preset stopping point” and will keep going as long as inflation is elevated After a year of erring on the side of optimism and getting it wrong it is an appeal for more humility For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 16th 2022,The complicated politics of crypto and web3,“IT’S VERY attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly” wrote Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin in an email in 2008 to Hal Finney a developer describing the appeal of the “e-cash” he planned to launch The attraction stemmed from bitcoin potential role as a currency free from verification by centralised third parties and from oversight by governments Bitcoin would instead be verified cryptographically and governed by its usersListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBitcoin doubtless appeals to those on the right At a conference in Miami on April 7th Peter Thiel the co-founder of PayPal a firm he once imagined as a young libertarian could supplant the world monetary system waxed poetic about bitcoin potential He views the technology as inherently political saying in 2020 that “if AI [artificial intelligence] is communist crypto is libertarian” AI represents the advance of centralised machines making top-down decisions; crypto requires many individuals and computers making decisions from the bottom upMr Thiel is not alone in thinking there is something inherently right-wing about crypto Marc Andreessen co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz a venture-capital firm agrees with the characterisation In 2021 he wrote that crypto could represent a “right-wing tech” that is both more decentralised and more comfortable with entrepreneurialism than the tech industryMr Andreessen is most animated by the opportunities stemming from “distributed consensus” Until now he argues collaborative online effort either adopted corporate norms from the real world or worked as open-source projects with no money involved By comparison crypto allows for new kinds of incentive systems where participants can be paid without a real-world company needing to exist Take Helium a decentralised wireless network for instance It encourages individuals to install “hot spots” in their homes for use by nearby internet-connected devices by compensating them in HNT a crypto token The more the hot spot is used the more tokens are paid outSuch architecture is commonly called “web3” a nod to its potential to be the next phase of the internet Chris Dixon of Andreessen describes the infrastructure as making it possible for organisations to be owned by token-holders who then vote on governance matters Modern tech firms are incentivised to build mammoth platforms that show users as many ads as they will bear By contrast developers and users of a web3 application could earn rewards for building and interacting with the platform In this world users would be able to vote on how Facebook or Twitter algorithms work Crucially they would also gather up their share of the profitsAt first glance the idea that these applications or projects can be built or contributed to by anyone is the stuff of freedom-loving libertarian dreams But the way projects themselves are being run has quite a lot in common with left-wing ideas Antonio García Martínez a former manager at Facebook and the author of “Chaos Monkeys” a book about Silicon Valley culture says that “you will never hear a venture capitalist sound more like a communist than when they are talking about web3” Blockchain-based enterprise might not be quite what Marx had in mind But the model behind it seems closer to the idea that the community should own the means of production distribution and exchange than modern capitalism doesThere is a comedy to venture capitalists talking like communitarian socialists notes Tomicah Tillemann of Haun Ventures a crypto fund As a former adviser to Joe Biden he is no libertarian Still a real shift is under way Virtually everyone agrees that the big-tech model is flawed he says Mr Thiel and his ilk loathe its de-platforming of right-wing voices; the left takes aim at its concentration of power and wealth Messrs Thiel Andreessen and Tillemann all see crypto as a serious threat to the status quoThe truth may be that web3 is simply nascent enough that people across the political spectrum see in it whatever they want If crypto really does make it possible for developers or users to build any kind of economic system then the applications that flourish will be the ones that work best Perhaps those will be libertarian Utopias where the Satoshis of the world retain their privacy But they could just as well be social-democratic metaverses with automatic wealth taxes and virtual paternalistic officialsRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Bonds signal recession Stocks have been buoyant What gives?

 Apr 16th 2022,What bigger military budgets mean for the economy,IN THE WAKE of the war in Ukraine military budgets around the world are about to get bigger This is most notable in Europe where the threat of Russian aggression looms largest Germany Italy and Norway among others have already decided to spend more on defence America and China the world two biggest military spenders are also ramping up their allocations Pressure on smaller countries to do likewise seems inevitable What are the economic consequences of this push? When governments spend more on soldiers and arms they have less available for other things A common assumption therefore is that extra spending on armies is harmful to growth and development But the relationship is not so straightforward In some cases bigger defence budgets may in fact yield substantial economic benefitsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat there is a trade-off between spending on the army and on say roads or hospitals is a lesson that students of economics internalise early on The classic model for illustrating the concept of opportunity costs is guns versus butter: the more you produce of one the less you can of the other In any given year that simple model holds true Governments have finite budgets which can only be pulled in so many different directionsIt is thus easy to see how spending on defence taken to an extreme could be corrosive for an economy If a government shortchanges the education system in order to buy shiny new weapons the long-run impact on productivity and ultimately growth would be baleful Some economists think America is nearing that danger zone The RAND Corporation an influential think-tank supported by the Air Force not exactly known as a peacenik outfit published a report in 2021 laying out two risks First when the government allocates money to defence at the expense of infrastructure that may undermine long-run growth prospects since America has a pressing need for better roads ports and more Second defence spending contributes to the public-debt load In both cases the analysts conclude anything that erodes America economic strength will ultimately hurt the armed forcesPerhaps there is something to the point that these trade-offs are damaging to the economy at America levels over the past decade its military budget averaged more than 4% of GDP second-highest in the OECD club of wealthy countries But a complication emerges when examining trends over time The OECD member that spends the most on defence at about 6% of GDP is Israel It also consistently boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the group By contrast Japan is one of the lowest military spenders as a share of GDP in the OECD and one of the slowest growers In fact it is almost impossible to discern a pattern in the data: there are also countries such as Ireland with military budgets similar to Japan and growth records similar to Israel A basic regression reveals no consistent relationship between GDP growth and military spending for the 38 countries in the OECDA sprawling body of research has come to a similar albeit more nuanced conclusion In a discussion paper at Monash University in 2014 Sefa Awaworyi Churchill and Siew Ling Yew examined 42 separate studies Effects are generally quite small but they found two distinct categories: military expenditure in poorer countries is often detrimental to growth whereas in wealthier countries it is more likely to be beneficial One possible reason they suggest is weaker governance in developing countries; a big military budget is a juicy target for corrupt officials Another possibility relates to the gun-versus-butter framework The potential returns on civilian investments from health care to education are so great in poor countries that military spending has a particularly high opportunity cost In rich countries with good schools and hospitals the opportunity costs ought to be lowerOne way in which defence spending might be said to boost the economy is as a jobs programme If the armed forces were a corporation they would be America largest employer with 2m workers counting active-duty personnel and civilians beating Walmart and Amazon That said it would be an eye-wateringly expensive jobs scheme running at nearly $400000 per employee a yearDefence spending may deliver better returns as an undeclared form of industrial policy In a paper last year Enrico Moretti of the University of California Berkeley and two colleagues looked at government funding for research and development R&D with a focus on defence spending in OECD countries On average they found that a 10% increase in government-financed R&D leads to a 5% increase in privately financed R&D in the targeted firm or industry Moreover there are knock-on benefits for productivity If France and Germany raised their defence spending to roughly the same level as in America Mr Moretti estimates that their productivity growth rates would be slightly higher as a resultDividends of deterrenceAn obvious objection is that the government could achieve the same results by supporting R&D in general without pumping money into the armed forces In an economic sense that may be true But there is a political constraintnamely how to marshal support for experimentation that may fail Public support for defence is less susceptible to mood swings Without having to worry about its next grant application the American military system has been free to churn out innovations from duct tape to the internet without which modern life would be scarcely imaginableImportant as it is to trace the impact of military spending on growth or innovation such exercises risk missing the wider context as demonstrated by Russia war in Ukraine A foundational element for any successful economy is peace and stability giving firms the confidence to invest and people the space to flourish Textbooks may talk of guns or butter But in a world unsettled by revanchist powers the truth is that it is both guns and butter A strong defence is regrettably a necessity for a strong economy Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:China has a celebrated history of policy experiments Apr 9thWill dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

 Apr 16th 2022,Xi Jinping bold plan for China next phase of innovation,THINGS ARE looking bright for Zhuzhou The city of 4m people in landlocked Hunan province has often caught the runoff of industrial business from the more populous provincial capital Changsha to its north In the 1990s it became a regional hub for chemicals and metals production But that caused horrible environmental destruction; more than 1000 polluters were eventually shut down with dire economic consequences Zhuzhou inland economy has remained behind that of coastal cities Over the past decade its moderate growth has been typical of the mid-tier cities that dot China interiorListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow however its officials talk as if it were a tech hub Hundreds of artificial-intelligence AI robotics and data companies have sprung up in the past year Local planning documents reflect the exuberance of a boomtown in the making something Zhuzhou could only watch from afar in the 1990s as eastern ports became richThe documents refer to “great changes not seen in 100 years” a phrase that has been used by Xi Jinping China president to signify the start of a new era He believes China is on the verge of a revolution in which dozens of cities will begin producing breakthroughs in robotics cloud computing and automation Zhuzhou officials also believe they are poised to reap the rewards of Mr Xi “common prosperity” campaigna plan to redistribute wealth from richer regions to poorer ones and from the dominant internet platforms to consumers and workersMr Xi strategy is best understood as a weighty bet that China is on track to become the world centre of innovation over the next decade A shift towards homegrown tech is altering the geographical layout of China manufacturing machine New investment and migration are being rerouted from rich coastal hubs to inland cities such as Zhuzhou A second feature is an unprecedented rise in the number of new tech companies The government is nurturing thousands of groups big and small in the fields of data science network security and robotics Mr Xi and his advisers are also taking firmer control over markets Their ability to direct capital flows is already evident in how private-equity groups invest in ChinaThis shift comes at a definitive moment The narrative that America and the West are in decline and that China is rising appears frequently in state media And yet China has not been more inward-looking since it was condemned internationally after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 The business hub of Shanghai a city of 25m people has been locked down as Mr Xi seeks to eradicate covid-19 His support for Russia during the war in Ukraine has raised the potential for more sanctions on Chinese firms These conditions seem only to strengthen his desire for self-relianceMr Xi is building an incubator state: an economy that relies heavily on government nourishment to create productivity gains with domestic research and technology In doing so he is also signalling a premature break with the technological convergence that has served China well since the 1980s when foreign companies began setting up factories using advanced technologies This tech was eventually transferred to local firms or reverse-engineered at little costThe payoff argues Raymond Yeung of ANZ a bank was the realisation of productive efficiencies One crucial feature of the convergence model was that it presented few risks China needed only to continue liberalising and foreign companies only to continue to bring in capital and high-tech gear to reap the rewardBut the era of convergence is drawing to a close China total-factor productivity growth languished at just above 1% per year between 2010 and 2019 Tech transfers are now far more restricted by America Mr Xi can surely imagine the sanctions devastating Russia being aimed at China The response has been to end reliance on foreign tech and to refocus the growth model on what can be created at homeHigh-stakes gambleRather like a venture-capital investor taking high-risk high-reward bets Mr Xi will shoulder more risk in this era His plan requires the creation of big globally competitive groups akin to Huawei a telecommunications giant “But they will have to develop lots of Huaweis” says Mr Yeung If the investments do not produce returns the plan will have saddled the economy with yet more debt and too little growthPast Chinese leaders have focused their reforms in coastal cities where manufactured goods could easily reach ports Shenzhen 700km south of Zhuzhou became emblematic of China rise as the factory of the world in the 1990s Some of that business crept westwards to cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing Mr Xi time in power at first focused on boosting consumption which also favoured the largest coastal cities On his watch Alibaba and Tencent based in the eastern and southern entrepôts of Hangzhou and Shenzhen respectively rose to prominence as engines for consumption and were often hailed as such by Party officialsThis has changed rapidly over the past two years Mr Xi is reorienting the economy back towards manufacturing The move away from consumer-internet tech or soft tech was made clear in the 14th five-year plan published in 2021 It emphasised instead rapid development in hard tech or areas such as AI semiconductors industrial software and big-data processing The new industrial policy does not require easy access to portsThe efforts could redraw China economic map An emphasis on manufacturing had pushed migrant workers not just to coastal towns but also to inland cities where new factories could be built cheaply says Chi Lo of BNP Paribas a bank The last great pulse of inland migration began in 2001 when China joined the WTO and lasted until 2013 when Mr Xi came to power and consumption became the focus for growth The past eight years witnessed a shift with migration out of inland centres to cities in the east Mr Lo believes China is near the start of another wave of inland migration that will power Mr Xi new industrial revolutionMigration is essential if the new tech firms are to be staffed A review of company-registration data by The Economist shows that firms dealing in big data AI the internet of things robotics cloud computing and clean energy are setting up at an unprecedented pace in China interior Many of the new hubs are capitals of poor provinces But many smaller cities too such as Zhuzhou are also experiencing explosive growth in tech firms see chartHefei in Anhui province one of China poorer regions is a city of about 9m It has reinvented itself in recent years as a tech hub with thousands of firms opening in a short period In 2021 alone more than 2500 companies claiming to develop basic AI software set up in the city up from just 370 in 2020 Thousands more say they offer related services The far northern rustbelt city of Shenyang welcomed more than 860 companies that say they are doing robotics research over the past two years up from a combined 170 in the four years before that Some 4400 groups claiming to be involved in the internet of things set up shop in the south-western city of Chengdu in 2021 four times the number in 2020The rapid growth in these cities is closely connected to local-government planning and the offer of generous tax and land incentives Indeed the figures should also come as a warning to planners that the tech boom they have induced is leading to potentially wasteful investments Take data-centre and cloud-computing businesses The pandemic created great demand for consumer-internet firms and in turn data services Local policies encouraged companies of all types to set them up or at least try Property developers needed only to convince local officials to sell them land and power cheaply in order to tap into the lucrative data-centre industry says Edison Lee of Jefferies an investment bankGuiyang a large city in the poor southwestern province of Guizhou witnessed an explosion in data-centre-company registrations in 2020 many with no experience in the area Some have even tried to move into cloud computing which requires more technological input than data centres The wave of innovation in AI robotics and climate tech is carrying with it many wannabes that will drain government funds not add to GDPSeveral investors have questioned where the talent needed to power this boom will come from The government has announced academic programmes to train people up But a shortfall seems clear The rerouting of migrants does not take into account that their skills have not kept up with Mr Xi industrial shift Almost 70% of the labour force has not had one day of high-school instruction notes Scott Rozelle of Stanford UniversityThe government needs more than a startup scene to make its plan work And so it is nurturing a new cohort of champions These are not the consumer-internet groups that dominated China digital economy Instead they are companies engaged in enterprise software industrial digitisation data security and state-owned cloud computing Few investors in Silicon Valley will have heard of Baosight Maxscend Sangfor Supcon or YoueData Many are listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen not New York and Hong Kong They are a mix of state and private firms but almost all are close to the government And they are working to upgrade China industrial infrastructure in order to usher in Mr Xi new revolutionBaosight is a state-owned industrial-software firm It builds the enterprise-resource-planning software and manufacturing-execution systems that are integrating and digitising industrial plants across China These systems aim to drive efficiency within the steel pharmaceuticals and chemicals industries Baosight recently completed work for a state steel group in what was considered the largest most complex integration project of its kind Its market capitalisation has risen three times over since 2018 to 62bn yuan $97bnSangfor Technologies a private network-security and data group based in Shenzhen is helping the government build advanced big-data platforms Supcon also privately controlled builds network ecosystems for state-owned firmsA small but growing number of international investors has cottoned on to these companies Their thinking could not be more different from the past generation of tech-watchers Companies such as Alibaba attracted funding as investors bet that only the private sector could provide the dizzying array of online shopping and financial services that would in turn support hefty valuations for a few big platformsSoft tech hard lineThat thesis has been dealt a heavy blow The government believes the consumer-internet craze widened inequality Companies’ market dominance allowed them to manipulate pricing while hoovering up unregulated personal data Their clout also dwarfed the influence the Party had over the digital economy These imbalances have been “rectified” as officials say by sweeping regulatory crackdownsThe state not only succeeded in knocking tech-market valuations by more than $2trn in the span of about a year It has pushed the giants into submission and decline Many executives such as Richard Liu of JDcom have stepped down Companies are laying off workers; few are pursuing capital-intensive acquisitionsFor the new champions to achieve scale they will need to be globally competitive and gain market share in developed economies Huawei was on this road before it was knocked back by America Mr Xi wants China to produce its own hard-tech companies in order to become more self-sufficient from the hostile West But even if this new phalanx of state-backed tech companies is less reliant on foreign inputs than Huawei it can still be barred from foreign markets denying it the business needed to grow to sufficient sizeHow China new boom is funded has become a vexing question for venture capitalists eager to find the next Alibaba but wary of running afoul of government policy Mr Xi is now six years into a reordering of capital and financial markets China 58trn-yuan shadow-banking market was first targeted in earnest in 2017 A three-year $450bn wave of speculative outbound investment driven by flamboyant tycoons was subdued the same year Meanwhile property developers were cut off from the supply of credit that financed a 20-year frenzyIn 2021 senior officials began referring to the enemy by name: a “disorderly expansion of capital” that has recklessly pursued high returns at the expense of the common good Hundreds of officials and businessmen have been taken down in recent years on corruption charges but only recently have some been accused of being “influenced by capital” Zhou Jiangyong a former Party secretary of Hangzhou the prosperous eastern city that is home to Alibaba is being investigated for such crimes He has also been linked by local media to companies affiliated with AlibabaMr Xi is already offering up a plan for an “orderly development of capital” He personally oversaw the launch of a new stock exchange in Beijing in 2021 that is focused on channelling investments to small tech groups State funds are raising ever more cash and investing in private tech firms The “little giants’‘ programme launched by the Ministry of Industry and Internet Technology is hand-picking thousands of firms that will be granted tax

 Apr 16th 2022,The latest industry to suffer labour shortages: investment banking,AFTER A DISMAL decade bankers of all stripes had reasons to be cheerful last year Eighteen months of soaring corporate dealmaking generated blockbuster fees for mergers and acquisitions M&A desks Their counterparts in debt advisory played midwife to a deluge of newly minted bonds Bouts of high volatility buoyed traders’ revenues Though the dealmaking frenzy may have cooled a little in 2022 lenders are licking their lips at the prospect of sharply rising interest ratesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet the industry faces a talent squeeze Bank bosses used the last earnings season of 2021 to gripe about the problem Deutsche Bank Christian Sewing was “very concerned” about a war for talent; Goldman Sachs David Solomon said it caused “wage inflation everywhere” The subject seemed likely to raise its head again as Wall Street banks reported their first-quarter earnings after we went to pressA survey of 267 financial-services employers conducted in November by Hays a London-based recruitment firm found that 83% had suffered from a skills shortage in the past year More than half attributed that to competition from rivals This is a sector more used to causing shortages than suffering from them sucking in would-be maths teachers and disaffected doctors Nor has its promise of riches dimmed: average pay at Goldman last year was $400000 Why the struggle to hire?One popular line of argument holds that banking is the victim of a generational shift Everyone from hiring managers to university careers services reports that young workers care less about salary and more about work-life balance Most of all they want to work for a company with a clear social purpose All of that puts the recruitment model for traditional financial firmshigh pay in return for gruelling hours and work with a social value that is not immediately obviousat riskThese apparent preferences are hard to square with the behaviour of younger applicants Darren Burns of Morgan McKinley another recruiter says they are becoming more hard-nosed in salary negotiations not less “Decent candidates will line up half a dozen offers when they used to only pursue one” he says They are also more aware of their market value As a result even back-office roles are having their salaries bid up One senior Wall Street banker puts it bluntly: “They say they care less about salary but they absolutely care if the bank across the street is paying more”Banking attractions then do not seem to have lost their appeal Instead the battle for talent is driven by three other factors Start with the scale of the demand for bankers’ work According to Refinitiv a data provider companies announced M&A deals worth $58trn in 2021 64% higher than the year before and easily beating the previous high in 2007 Initial public offerings had a record-breaking year too with newly listed firms raising $608bn And of the $10trn in American corporate bonds 42% was issued in the past two yearsAll that equates to an avalanche of work for investment bankers The industry staffing model meanwhile is ill-suited to spikes in demand “If the large banks aren’t able to pay their best people well they lose them all” explains one headhunter The only way to do that and remain profitable is to be ruthless about headcount running teams with “very little fat” in normal times When business balloons as it did in 2021 those lean teams very quickly end up working at full capacityat which point the only options are to poach people from elsewhere or to turn down business The result is a fierce zero-sum skirmish between banks for skilled staffAt the same time the list of other firms offering bankers eye-watering salaries has lengthened Private-equity funds have long piggybacked off the training offered by the big investment banks luring talent away with better pay and slightly gentler working hours Banks in America are particularly vulnerable with a supersized private-investment industry offering just as supersized compensation Blackstone one of the biggest such firms received 29000 applications for 100 junior-level jobs in 2021 In recent years these have been joined by a growing cohort of dealmakers going it alone and taking firms public via special-purpose acquisition companies M&A boutiques which advise on mergers without the full-service offering of an investment bank entice still more bankers away from bankingThird there has indeed been a shift in workers’ attitudesjust not one that results from them being unwilling to hack the hours of their predecessors Florian Pollner of McKinsey a consultancy describes how in conversations with human-resources bosses a theme that comes up time and again is younger workers’ more modular approach to their careers Instead of looking for jobs for life they seek out roles they can spend a few years in and then leave with broader optionsThat works in banks’ favour for recruiting junior staff: their graduate schemes are still seen as excellent preparation for a career But it also puts pressure on attrition rates in an industry already known for the mercenary outlook of its employeesThese forces are changing the way banks recruit and retain their staff Many have long tried to draw employees from a more diverse pool That task is now more urgent and goes beyond lines like race and gender Mr Pollner sees banks at all levels recruiting from a much broader range of universities than they used toand just as important trying to hire people with personalities “different to the stereotype of the average banker” Retention efforts have a darker side too: an investment manager at a London private-equity fund reports having hired juniors from two separate banks only to have both receive letters from their former employers suggesting they might have to repay bonuses in the end they did notThe net result within investment banking is likely to be a widening gap between the largest and most profitable banks chiefly American ones and “second-tier” firms including European banks The latter have long had to pay more and take greater risk to compensate for not having the prestige and huge domestic market of the Wall Street giants That has sometimes had dire consequences: Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have suffered such frequent losses from scandals and exposure to dubious clients that they have become the butt of industry jokesAs second-tier banks struggle to muster the financial firepower to recruit senior talent that problem will only worsen The fewer skilled staff they attract the less deal-flow they capture and the faster their investment banks must shrink In recent years many European banks have been forced to flee Wall Street or close their racier outfits altogether More of them may become casualties of the talent war raging at the cutting edge of capitalism For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to

 Apr 9th 2022,The Federal Reserve prepares for quantitative tightening,QUANTITATIVE EASING or QE once an unconventional tool of monetary policy has become commonplace over the past decade During the pandemic alone the Federal Reserve bought a staggering $33trn in Treasuries and $13trn in mortgage-backed securities as it sought to keep borrowing costs low The reverse process quantitative tightening QT when central banks shrink their balance-sheets has been far rarer The Fed is the only central bank to have truly attempted it and it had to stop abruptly in 2019 because of market ructions So its plan for reducing its assetstrailed in the minutes of its meeting in March published on April 6thtakes it into relatively uncharted territoryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOfficials like to downplay the significance of QT When at the Fed helm Janet Yellen compared it to watching paint dry Jerome Powell her successor says it will operate in the background In truth it is akin to dismantling an auxiliary engine for the economy with only hazy knowledge of the consequencesAs Lael Brainard a member of the Fed board noted on April 5th this round of QT will be more aggressive than the Fed previous iteration With inflation racing ahead and the labour market tight the central bank wants to cool the economy quickly Coupled with interest-rate rises QT is likely to be a drag on growthSo far the Fed has reinvested the proceeds of maturing bonds in order to maintain its stock of assets The minutes suggest it is likely to shrink its balance-sheet not by making active sales but by letting some maturing bonds “roll off” without reinvestment The roll-off may start in May Come July all going well the Fed will raise the maximum roll-off to $95bn per month split between $60bn of Treasuries and $35bn of mortgage-backed bonds At full tilt the Fed could shrink its balance-sheet by more than $1trn over a 12-month period twice as fast as its first go at QT “Even if it done in a predictable way this is a big adjustment for markets” says Brian Sack of DE Shaw an investment firmMultiple rounds of bond-buying by central banks since the financial crisis of 2007-09 have yielded some understanding of how QE works It signals a commitment to ultra-low interest rates It suppresses long-term rates And it supports liquidity ensuring that markets operate smoothlyQT looks like QE in reverse Instead of creating central-bank reserves held by the private sector by purchasing bonds the central bank drains reserves by refraining from reinvesting as bonds mature The three channels through which QE works also operate in reverse First QT sends a signal that rate rises are coming Notably it was in early January when the Fed discussed a faster approach to QT than many had expected that market rates shot upThe second channel QT direct impact on yieldsinvolves heroic guesstimates Some analysts think the Fed will shrink its balance-sheet by $3trn over the next three years taking it to about 20% of GDP down from 36% now Mark Cabana of Bank of America reckons this could equate to anywhere between a quarter point and 125 percentage points of rate increasesa remarkably wide range Mr Powell has also noted the uncertainty about QT: “We have a much better sense frankly of how rate increases affect financial conditions”When the Fed raises interest rates it is raising overnight borrowing rates which then ripple along the yield curve With QT the main impact is on longer-term yields For some economists such as Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this means that QT could be more potent than rate rises since it would target hot segments of the credit market such as mortgages The Fed has said that it will stick with rate increasesthe devil it knowsas its main tool If however QT does hit longer yields it may need fewer rate rises to tame inflationThe final channel is liquidity As the Fed buys fewer bonds there may be fewer transactions overall Indeed a Bloomberg index that measures the ease of trading Treasuries recently worsened to levels last seen at the pandemic start That echoes uncomfortably with the past round of QT which culminated in a liquidity crunch in the overnight-borrowing market But the Fed is better prepared this time There is much more cash in the market to begin with And the Fed has set up an overnight-lending facility which should let banks get funds if needed “The risk of a spike in rates like we had in September 2019 is much much lower” says Bill Dudley former president of the New York FedYet new concerns will emerge The Fed mortgage bonds have long tenors so passive roll-offs would take decades The central bank may have to make active sales which it wants to avoid Another concern is the Fed $326bn in short-term Treasury bills Some observers think it will roll them off supercharging QT; others fear that would stoke volatility But the biggest worry is whether QT will work as intended

 Apr 9th 2022,China has a celebrated history of policy experiments,IN MAY 1919 John Dewey an American philosopher embarked on a lecture tour of China “We are going to see more of the dangerous daring side of life here” he predicted His celebration of learning by doing and social experimentation was enthusiastically received by the country daring reformers and dangerous revolutionaries At least one of his lectures was attended by a young schoolteacher called Mao Zedong “Everything through experimentation” Dewey declared on his tour Chairman Mao would later repeat the line as China rulerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the scattered bases occupied by China communists before 1949 experimentation was unavoidable points out Sebastian Heilmann in his book “Red Swan: How Unorthodox Policymaking Facilitated China's Rise” The communists lacked the manpower or administrative reach to impose uniform policies Instead they introduced new measures such as land reform in model villages or “experimental points” before spreading them across the “surface” of their territory The aim was to learn by doing without doing anything uncontainably calamitous These “model experiences” Mao wrote were “much closer to reality and richer than the decisions and directives issued by our leadership organs”A similar “point-to-surface” approach was embraced by China leaders after Mao Indeed the central government has initiated over 630 such experiments since 1980 according to a recent paper by Shaoda Wang of the University of Chicago and David Yang of Harvard University It has experimented with carbon trading fisheries insurance business licensing and fiscal devolution A report last month by China planning agency referred to pilot schemes covering everything from cross-border e-commerce and housing provident funds to green electricity and recyclable packagingThese trials are not mere formalities The results can go either way About 46% of experimental policies are never rolled out nationwide according to Messrs Wang and Yang An unsuccessful trial can nonetheless yield useful lessons for future reforms Failure as Mao once put it is the mother of success: “a fall into the pit” can yield “a gain in your wit”China has indeed gained a lot from using this method It is a “huge improvement” on a “counterfactual world” in which all central policies are implemented without any experimentation Mr Wang argues The point-to-surface technique is one reason why communist China has survived and advanced even as other socialist regimes have stagnated or collapsed according to Mr Heilmann Such unexpected outcomes are sometimes described as “black swans” In China case he argues red seems the more appropriate colourThis long and celebrated history notwithstanding China is surprisingly bad at policy experiments Its trials are not as clean as they could be skewing the conclusions its leaders draw One problem is their location According to China planning agency “sites should be fairly representative” But contrary to this sound advice 80% of experiments since the 1980s have taken place in localities that are richer than average according to Messrs Wang and Yang Another bias is fiscal When local authorities experiment with an area of policy such as education or agriculture they tend to spend 5% more money on that area than otherwise similar counties that are not taking part in the experimentExperiments can also be skewed by less measurable factors Some local officials for example simply put more effort into these pilot exercises than others This is particularly true of ambitious young cadres who have more scope for promotion because they are still far from retirement age To measure this extra effort Messrs Wang and Yang devise an ingenious proxy They compare the language employed by local governments in describing the experiment Leaders with more room for promotion differentiate their language from the boilerplate used by their upwardly immobile counterparts elsewhereExtra effort more spending and atypical prosperity can all skew the results of a policy experiment Some of these biases may be well known to seasoned policymakers in Beijing But if so national leaders do not act as if they are aware of them They tend to favour successful trials regardless of the true source of that success The more prosperous an experimental site the better the chance the policy will be adopted nationwide Such backing is also more likely if the host county just happens to enjoy a fiscal windfall during the trial period say because a fortuitous cut in interest rates raises land values The central government does not seem to disentangle the merits of an innovative policy from the idiosyncrasies of the places that pilot itA duck dressed up as a swanThis has national consequences When new policies are spread across the surface of the country the localities that most closely resemble the experimental “points” benefit the most judged by their subsequent economic growth Since experimental sites tend to be richer than average the policies that emerge from experimentation may “systematically favour” the richer parts of China Messrs Wang and Yang argue That is not an outcome that Mao or Dewey would have welcomed: inequity through experimentationHow can China reform this engine of reform moving its experiments closer to reality? Another striking calculation by the researchers suggests one useful place to start They point out that local officials are 22% more likely to be promoted if they take part in a successful experiment To improve this technique therefore China leaders will have to fix the politics that attend it In recent years under Xi Jinping experimentation has become “forced and feigned” according to Mr Heilmann Local administrators enjoy little “leeway and they are fearful of making policy and ideological mistakes along the way” There will be no gain in wit if local policymakers fear a fall into the pit Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Will dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?

The shocking headlines come at you relentlessly But look out of the window and everything seems calm The only sound is the chirping of crickets You start to wonder said Hicks: where is all this bad stuff happening?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA lot of bad stuff is happening just now most notably a war in Europe There is also inflation and growing fears of recession Government bonds have just had their worst quarter for returns in ages The Treasury yield-curve has inverted: the gap between yields on ten- and two-year bonds recently turned negative an early warning of a downturn The Federal Reserve is growing more hawkish Yet stocks are surprisingly buoyant Even after a few days fairly deep in red ink this week the S&P 500 index of stocks is only 7% below its all-time high This might look like a foolish stockmarket failing to take its cue from a more realistic bond market But the truth is more complicatedThere are lots of plausible explanations for the resilience of stocks An evergreen one is that there is no good alternative to owning them Investors need to put money to work and American stocks are the least-worst option Bonds are a snare As long as inflation is expected to exceed interest rates they are a sure-fire way to lose purchasing power The yield on ten-year inflation-protected bonds is still negative even after the big repricing in bond markets The earnings yield on equities is comfortably higher than this real bond yield And stocks offer some protection against inflation in as much as corporate revenues are indexed to rising consumer pricesIn any event the risk of recession in America is not immediate The Fed has barely started to tighten monetary policy Even a rapid series of interest-rate increases will take time to slow the economy The negative spread between ten- and two-year yields is an early-warning signal not a blaring alarm On average recession hits more than a year after this part of the yield curve inverts In the meantime the equity market typically goes up Looked at in this light the message to take is to hold stocks for nowUnderlying all these rationalisations is a sense that equity investors do not quite believe the Fed will follow through on all the interest-rate increases the bond market is pricing in Perhaps that is why the Fed rate-setters are sounding more and more hawkish in public One strain of this belief gives the Fed too much credit: it says it can easily conquer inflation without crashing the economy Another strain gives it too little credit: this school doubts the Fed stomach to engineer a recession for the sake of price stability If the result of such qualms is that inflation lingers above the Fed 2% target for longer then so be it That would be a bigger problem for bond returns than for equitiesIt is possible to pick holes in all these arguments But it is not quite right to conclude that the stockmarket has failed to adjust to new and harsher realities The best-performing industries in the S&P 500 in the first quarter were those likely to be resilient to stagflation: energy utilities and consumer staples Meanwhile technology stocksflag-bearers of the “secular stagnation” era of low inflation and low interest rateshave had a brutal few months The violence of this sector rotation away from tech has caused remarkably few ripples in the overall stockmarket Nevertheless equity investors were mindful of the world outside their window The Bank of America global fund-manager survey suggests that investors reduced the weighting of technology stocks in their portfolios as far back as November notes Kevin Russell of UBS O’Connor the hedge-fund unit of the Swiss asset manager The stockmarket has been ahead of the bond market on the risks of inflation not behind it he arguesA big question is how far all financial markets are running behind the reality of inflation The phase during which asset prices adjust to the prospects of tighter Fed policy does not seem to have quite run its course And the pattern of the past two years is for one market phase to give way quickly to another Everything is moving faster these days But the relentlessness of scary financial headlines is not a confection of the 24-hour news cycle Instead it is a reflection of a super-charged business cycle which looks setmuch like Bill Hicksto burn brightly and die youngRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Can the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?

 Apr 9th 2022,Omicron is dealing a big blow to China economy,OMICRON MOVES fast That makes it difficult to containeven for China which tries to stomp promptly on any outbreak A cluster of infections in Shanghai for example has forced the government to impose a hurried lockdown for which it seems woefully unpreparedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe variant speed also makes China economic prospects unusually hard to track A lot can happen in the time between a data point release and its reference period The most recent hard numbers on China economy refer to January and February Those surprisingly good figures look dated even quaint For most of that time there was no war in Europe And new covid-19 cases in mainland China averaged fewer than 200 per day compared with the 23107 reported on April 7th Relying on official economic figures is like using a rear-view mirror to steer through a chicaneFor a more timely take on China economy some analysts are turning to less conventional indicators Baidu a search engine and mapping tool provides a daily mobility index for instance Over the week to April 3rd this was more than 48% below its level a year ago The index is best suited to tracking movement between cities says Ting Lu of Nomura a bank To gauge the hustle and bustle within cities he uses other indicators such as subway trips Over the week ending April 2nd the number of metro journeys in eight big cities was nearly 34% lower than a year ago In Shanghai where many subway lines are now closed the number of trips was down by 93% a worse drop than in early 2020The two numbers that worry Mr Lu most track distribution services In the week ending April 1st an index of express deliveries by courier companies was nearly 27% below its level at a similar point last year Over the same period an index of road freight fell by 128% The decline looks especially stark because the measure was rising briskly at the end of last yearUnconventional measures are all the more valuable in China because of doubts about the official data The strong figures for January and February for example are not only old but odd They suggest that investment in “fixed” assets like infrastructure manufacturing facilities and property grew by 122% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier But that is hard to square with double-digit declines in the output of steel and cement The recovery in property investment also looks peculiar alongside the fall in housing sales starts and land purchases When some local governments said that they were double-checking their figures at the behest of the National Bureau of Statistics NBS it became clear that the official statistics look odd even to the official statisticiansChina high-frequency indicators proved their worth in spring 2020 Economists were timid at first in cutting their growth forecasts No one knew exactly how the economy would react or what the NBS would be prepared to report Armed with evidence from high-frequency data forecasters were eventually brave enough to predict a GDP decline in the first quarter of 2020 Indeed it shrank by 68% according to even the official figuresThe timeliness of unconventional indicators makes them valuable in periods of flux Still “there are many traps” says Mr Lu Any short period can be distorted say by bad weather or holidays And annual growth rates can be skewed by past idiosyncrasies Moreover what does a dramatic weekly decline in road freight mean for quarterly GDP growth? It is impossible to say with any precision Many indicators also have only a short history As a PhD student Mr Lu was trained in econometrics “But with only one or two years of data if I used the kind of techniques I learned at school people would laugh at me”To help avoid some of the traps Mr Lu and his team watch “a bunch of numbers” “If seven or eight out of ten indicators are worsening then we can be confident that GDP growth is getting worse” he says Right now he thinks “something must be going very wrong” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterDig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub
 Apr 5th 2022,Are labour markets in the rich world too tight?,LAST MONTH Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve identified the most uncomfortable trade-off in economics “Today labour market” he said at a press conference is “tight to an unhealthy level” In most places and at most times a fall in unemployment or a rise in the number of people in work is welcome But labour markets can become too strained creating worker shortages that stop production and cause wages to spiral which can feed into overall inflationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Powell fears that America has crossed the threshold from good-tight to bad-tight one reason why the Fed is signalling that higher interest rates are on the way Increasingly though labour markets elsewhere in the rich world are also straining at the seamsAlmost nobody saw this coming When the pandemic struck in 2020 most economists believed that the rich world was in for a long spell of high unemployment similar to what happened after the financial crisis of 2007-09 In April 2020 America unemployment rate hit 147% Had joblessness declined at its post-financial-crisis pace the unemployment rate in March this year would have been over 13%In fact it is 36% And America by many standards is a laggard A rise in the number of Americans who have decided they do not want to work at all and who therefore do not count as unemployed means that the share of 15-to-64-year-olds with a job is slightly below its level at the end of 2019 see chart 1 In one-third of rich countries however this share is at an all-time high Even among the other two-thirds which includes America the median shortfall in the employment rate is just one percentage point It adds up to the quickest and broadest-based jobs boom in historyCanada and Germany are among the countries with record employment rates The same is true of France known for its high joblessness The working-age employment rate in Greece is three percentage points above its level in 2019 Across the OECD group of mostly rich countries there are about 20m more jobs than had been forecast in June 2020 The number of unemployed people chasing unfilled vacancies is the lowest it has been in decades see chart 2 Even as pricey energy and rising interest rates provoke concern about the economy there is little sign from “real-time” indicators that demand for labour is droppingWhy is the jobs recovery so fast? One reason is the nature of the shock that hit the economy in 2020 History shows that financial crunchestight monetary policy banking disasters and so oncause prolonged pain But economies usually recover speedily from “real” disruptions such as natural disasters wars and in this case a pandemic In 2005 Louisiana unemployment rate soared after Hurricane Katrina but quickly fell back though part of the adjustment came from people moving away After the second world war European labour markets rapidly absorbed soldiers returning from the front linesGovernment policy has also boosted jobs In 2020 countries including Australia Britain France and Germany launched or expanded job-protection or furlough schemes At the peak over a fifth of European workers remained technically employed even as they twiddled their thumbs When lockdowns lifted they could quickly return to their rolesrather than having to search and apply for work which takes time and thus keeps unemployment elevated America launched a modest job-protection scheme but its efforts were largely targeted at maintaining peoples’ incomes via stimulus cheques and topped-up unemployment benefitsStimulus schemes shored up families’ finances Many households also reined in spending in 2020 allowing them to accumulate huge savings The stockpile is now being spent on everything from consumer goods to housing raising demand for workers in areas such as online retail and property services including an extra 200000 estate agents in AmericaNice workers if you can get themWith labour demand so strong employers are having not only to increase the number of jobs but also to improve their quality Amazon exaggerated when last year it said it would try to be “Earth best employer” but many other companies are promising similar things whether by offering employees better in-office benefits such as tastier cafeteria food or better compensation packages free college tuition In 2021 venture investors put more than $12bn into global HR tech startups roughly 36 times the capital invested in them in 2020 according to PitchBook a data providerBad employers are having a tough time The share of Americans worried about poor job security is near a historical low In Britain the share of full-time workers on a “zero-hours contract” where there are no guaranteed hours soared after the financial crisis but is now falling Many of the gig-economy firms that grew in the early 2010s by relying on an army of underemployed workers are struggling to find staff Whether in London Paris or San Francisco hailing a ride is harder than it used to beThe best measure of labour-market tightness is pay which distils the relative bargaining power of workers and firms into a single number In some places the situation is clearly getting out of hand Wheeler County Nebraska is a heavily agricultural place a long way from anywhere In December unemployment fell to around 05% Jobs at a nearby Chipotle Mexican Grill pay $15-1650 an hour at least twice the federal minimum Some firms claim to be raising wages by 30% or moreSome countries still look decidedly un-Nebraskan Japanese wage growth is easing not accelerating In December the “special wage” which includes winter bonuses and typically makes up about half of total cash wages in that month fell by 1% year on year German wage growth is doing nothing special Canada is respectable but it is hard to make the case that things are out of controlOn average however labour markets across the rich world are clearly getting tighter America is plainly overheating In March average hourly earnings were 56% higher than a year earlier on the headline measure Another gauge suggests that the lowest-paid are seeing bigger rises see chart 3 Goldman Sachs a bank produces a wage tracker that corrects for various pandemic-related distortions It is more than 5% higher than a year ago the fastest rate of increase since the data began in the 1980s Almost all wage measures in America show unusually rapid growth by comparison manufacturing wages rose by an annual average of 41% in 1960-2019Before the pandemic underlying French wage growth was in the region of 1-2% a year Now it is close to 3% Italy looks similar On March 23rd Norway central bank noted that “wage inflation has been higher than projected and wage expectations have risen” Britain is particularly striking On Goldman measure underlying pay there is rising at an annual rate of about 5% Surveys of businesses suggest that even faster growth over the coming year cannot be ruled out Across the G10 large economies as a whole wages are rising by at least 4% a yearIs this sustainable? To most people wage growth of 4% hardly sounds malign But the arithmetic is inescapable At 4% wage growth labour productivity ie the value of what workers produce per hour must grow by at least 2% a year in order to be consistent with an inflation target of 2% Businesses would pass on half their extra hourly wage costs to customers in the form of higher prices but would absorb the other half since they would be selling more goods and services or producing them more efficientlyProductivity growth of 2% a year is not unachievable but it would be a lot stronger than it was before the pandemic Although productivity growth does seem faster than normal our analysis of data from OECD countries suggests that it falls short of 2% It may yet rise as companies reap the gains from their large investments in remote-working technologies and digitisation Hopes of higher productivity however must be weighed against fears of still-higher wage growthIf heady wage growth cannot be sustained how might it fall? One long-floated possibility in those countries with lagging overall employment rates is that people who have left the workforce return boosting the supply of labour Fear of covid-19 might eventually fade and child care might become easier to find easing worker shortages and causing wage growth to fallThis hope is receding however Although many Americans have returned to the workforce over the past six months wage growth has not slowedin fact it has accelerated The Economist calculates that in September there were nearly 19m “missing” workers aged 25 to 54 based on participation rates in January 2020 and adjusting for population growth By March 2022 this had fallen by more than half to about 750000or less than two months’ worth of job growth at the recent pace There are another 13m missing older workers but most are over 65 and likely to have retired permanently and the number of missing over-65s has been growingIt is likely therefore that in America and elsewhere labour markets will have to be cooled the old-fashioned way: by central banks raising interest rates making it a little more attractive to save than spend and choking off demand for labour The Fed has already increased rates by 025 percentage points and is expected to do so by a total of 25 points this year America may prove an example of what happens when policymakers respond to a labour market that has become dangerously hot For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,What can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?,ON FEBRUARY 22ND two days before Russia invaded Ukraine a German-flagged vessel left the Russian port of Primorsk loaded with 33000 tonnes of oil When it reached Tranmere a British oil terminal on March 3rd it received a frosty welcome Some dockers refused to unload the freight when they learnt where it had come from Similar boycotts have sprung up elsewhere Kayrros a data firm estimates that the volume of oil “on water” rose by nearly 13% in the fortnight after the invasion in large part as undelivered Russian cargo sought new takers The number of vessels returning to Russia also jumpedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMost of what has flowed out of Russia in recent weeks was bought and paid for before the war started Now less oil is leaving the country in the first place Worries about sanctions and bad publicity have prompted many buyers to pause purchases On March 24th the volume of Russian seaborne oil exports at 23m barrels per day bpd was nearly 2m below the level on March 1st reckons Kpler a data firm As those barrels fail to sell the price of Brent crude is nearing $115 Yet for the countries willing to risk opprobrium and jump through new logistical hoops Russian oil is beginning to look like a bargainThe partial embargo of Russia has echoes with the blockade of Iran by the West in the 2010s which led the Islamic Republic to put together an unrivalled playbook for smuggling oil In May 2018 America imposed “maximum pressure” sanctions with the aim of halting Iran oil exports altogether It almost succeeded: by October 2019 they had fallen to an average of 260000 bpd from 23m before the sanctions Since then however they have revived a little averaging 850000 bpd in the three months to February 2022Iran manages to sell oil through two channels The first is through authorised but restricted sales As it imposed its sanctions America granted a limited exemption to eight importing countries There is a big catch however: the sales have to be made in the buyers’ currency and either kept in escrow accounts at local banks or spent on a list of goods produced locally For Iran that is deeply frustrating In December it was forced to accept tea from Sri Lanka as payment for an oil debt valued at $251mTo circumvent the restrictions Iran smuggles vast quantities of oilits second channel for sales Iranian tankers sail to America foes such as Venezuela with their transponders turned off Some are repainted to hide their provenance Others transfer their cargo in the high seas often at night to ships sailing under a different flag Oil is also moved over land by smuggling gangs says Julia Friedlander a former intelligence official now at the Atlantic Council a think-tank in Washington Petroleum is bartered with China Turkey and the United Arab Emirates against gold pesticides and even housing projects in Tehran Traders in Dubai home to half a million Iranians blend crude from the Islamic Republic with other similar grades which they then rebrand as Kuwaiti oilRussia is unlikely to take a leaf out of Iran book mainly because for now it doesn’t need to The penalties imposed on Iran include secondary sanctions that threaten third-country banks dealing with it with huge fines That makes overtly buying its oil risky By contrast Russia faces a weaker embargo Only America which did not buy much to begin with has banned its oil On March 25th Germany said it would cut its purchases by half but it is unclear when that would start Sales transmitted through pipelines which are less conspicuous than shipments and represent about a fifth of Russia total exports of crude are still flowing Secondary sanctions have not been imposedInstead seaborne exports have cratered because Western buyers such as big energy firms fear a public backlash They also face logistical headaches as cautious banks cut credit ship owners struggle to obtain insurance and freight costs soar And each time sanctions are tweaked says Antonia Tzinova of Holland & Knight a law firm compliance staff must study hundreds of pages of legalese making many Russian deals hardly worth the hassle As a result Urals crude the grade pumped out by Russia is currently trading at a discount of around $31 a barrel One trader expects the gap to hit $40 within a week timeTwo big countries that have not joined in with the West sanctionsIndia and Chinasense a bargain to be had India is certainly acting on the opportunity Russian ship loadings headed for the subcontinent are expected to have risen to 230000 bpd in March up from nothing in the previous three months this excludes CPC a blend of mainly Kazakh and Russian crude Yet India is unlikely to buy much at least in the short term Nearly half its imports come from the Middle East and shipping from the Gulf is much cheaper than shipping from Russia Payment cannot be settled in dollars requiring India to experiment with a rouble-rupee mechanism see next storyAdi Imsirovic a former oil-trading boss of Gazprom now at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies does not see India buying more than 10m barrels a month This is small considering that Russia pool of unwanted oil is expected by the International Energy Agency an official forecaster to reach 3m bpd in AprilOnly China then can save Russia It imports a total of about 105m bpd 11% of the world daily production Mr Imsirovic thinks China could opportunistically increase its purchases to 12m bpd That could allow it to buy 60m from Russia in relatively short order It helps that China has lots of empty storageNone of this is happening yet Even for China transporting oil from Russia has become harder Whereas shipment from Russia to Europe usually takes three or four days to Asia it takes 40 Oil must be loaded onto bigger tankers which is slow and costly Chinese banks are loth to lendPayment is another problem Financiers in Hong Kong who have ample access to greenbacks have helped North Korea receive hard currency in the past But Russia energy deals would be far too large to hide in the city financial system says a trade lawyer And its main regulator would not turn a blind eye to such dealings lest they lead America to suspend Hong Kong ability to clear dollars locally a privilege central to its economyOne fix however is for Russia to use Chinese bank accounts within China to receive payment in yuan Those accounts could then be used to finance imports of essential goods avoiding the cross-border dimension of trade accountingChina may also be biding its time Even with the extra costs buying Russian oil would save lots of money And Chinese traders know a bargain when they see one: when the oil price neared single digits during the covid-induced downturn of 2020 they stocked up to the gills As Russia trading position weakens the Urals discount will go up So will China purchasesSuch a move will not be easily reversed Most refineries are configured to guzzle certain types of crude meaning switching from the high-sulphur Urals variety to say Saudi Arabia super light takes time and money That in turn suggests Russia push into Asia and Europe scramble for supplies could reshape the global market Much of North Sea oil usually goes east; more of it might now stay in Europe The continent will probably also buy more from West Africa and America and crank up its imports of sulphur-rich grades from the Gulf The rest of the worldAsia includedwill have to content itself with what Europe does not want Oil from the Tupi field in Brazil already trades at twice the premium to Brent than usualThe result of this more fragmented global oil-trading system will be a structurally higher price for importers Until the war petroleum generally flowed seamlessly from oilfields to the fuel tanks that needed it most Now says Ben Luckock of Trafigura a trading firm that finely tuned system has been disrupted For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Apr 2nd 2022,Under unprecedented sanctions how is the Russian economy faring?,IN RESPONSE TO Russia invasion of Ukraine the West launched an economic war America banned the sale of a wide range of goods to Russia; big companies pulled out by the dozen; and a number of countries together froze 60% of the central bank international reserves The idea was to send Russia economy into free fall punishing President Vladimir Putin for his aggression In the week after the invasion the rouble fell by more than a third against the dollar and the share prices of many Russian companies collapsedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIs the West strategy still going to plan? The chaos in Russian markets seems to have subsided Since its low in early March the rouble has jumped and is now approaching its pre-war level The main benchmark of Russian stocks plunged by a third but has since stabilised The government and most firms are keeping up with their payments on foreign-currency bonds A run on banks that saw nearly 3trn roubles $31bn withdrawn came to an end with Russians returning much of the cash to their accountsA battery of policies has helped stabilise the markets Some are orthodox The central bank has raised interest rates from 95% to 20% encouraging people to hold interest-bearing Russian assets Other policies are less conventional The government has decreed that exporters must convert 80% of their foreign-exchange proceeds into roubles Trading on the Moscow stock exchange has become to use the central bank euphemism “negotiated” Short-selling is banned and non-residents cannot offload stocks until April 1stThe real economy though is in some ways the mirror image of the financial one: healthier than it seems at first glance A weekly measure of consumer prices shows that they have risen by more than 5% since the beginning of March alone Many foreign firms have pulled out cutting the supply of goods while a weaker currency and sanctions have made imports more expensive But not everything is surging in price Vodka largely produced domestically costs only a bit more than it did before the war Petrol costs about the same And though it is early days there is little evidence yet of a big hit to economic activityAccording to an estimate based on internet-search data and produced by the OECD a rich-country think-tank Russia GDP in the week to March 26th was about 5% higher than the year before Other “real-time” data gathered by The Economist such as electricity consumption and railway loadings of goods are holding up A spending tracker produced by Sberbank Russia largest lender is slightly up year on year Part of this reflects people stockpiling goods before prices rise: spending on home appliances is especially strong But spending on services has fallen only a bit and remains far healthier than it was during much of the pandemicRussia seems sure to enter a recession this year But whether it ends up faring as badly as most economists predictthe wonks are pencilling in a GDP decline of 10-15%depends on three factors The first is whether ordinary Russians start worrying about the economy as the war drags on and reduce spendingas happened in 2014 when Russia invaded Crimea The second is whether production eventually grinds to a halt as sanctions block firms’ access to imports from the West Russia aviation sector looks particularly vulnerable as does the car industry Yet many big businesses that started during Soviet times are used to operating without imports If any economy could come close to coping with being cut off from the world it would be RussiaThe third and most important factor relates to Russia fossil-fuel exports Despite the many sanctions imposed on it Russia is still selling about $10bn-worth of oil a month to foreign buyers equivalent to a quarter of its pre-war exports; revenues from the sale of natural gas and other petroleum products are still flowing in too This provides a valuable source of foreign currency with which it can buy some consumer goods and parts from neutral or friendly countries Unless that changes the Russian economy may continue to defy the worst predictions For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,The White House wants to close a tax loophole used by the ultra-rich,MOST AMERICANS want the government to impose higher taxes on the ultra-rich Every few months or so Democratic lawmakers unveil plans for doing just that only to stumble well before enacting them It is not just that the wealthy can afford powerful lobbyists The nature of their fortunes also makes them an elusive target for tax authorities A new proposal by the Biden administration may offer a partial solution provided it can overcome political and legal hurdlesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea contained in President Joe Biden new budget proposal on March 28th is that Americans worth more than $100m would pay a minimum tax of 20% on all their income including controversially the appreciation of their investments If an ultra-rich American makes a paper gain of say $10m on his stock portfolio in a year he would face a liability of $2mThe goal is to close a gaping loophole Wealthy Americans must pay capital-gains taxes of at least 20% when they sell assets But when assets are inherited the price at the time of the transfer forms the new basis for calculating capital gains In this way the ultra-rich can shrink their tax bills: they owe nothing on unsold assets while alive and their heirs then benefit from the “stepped-up basis” for capital gains Economists in the Biden administration have calculated that the 400 wealthiest American families pay an average federal income-tax rate of just 8% far below the rates paid by most in the middle classA simple way to close this loophole would be to recognise all capital gains upon inheritance Indeed that was Mr Biden preference in legislation last year But opponents tarred it as a “death tax” that would bankrupt family farms Although that charge was unfairalmost all farms would have been below the tax thresholdthe Democrats dropped the ideaThe Biden administration dubs the new proposal a “billionaire minimum income tax” Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Centre a think-tank calls this an ingenious rebranding of the stepped-up basis idea “It would operate like a pre-payment” he says Taxes owed at death would be reduced by those paid previouslyThe White House reckons the new tax would bring in $360bn over the next decade impressive for a levy that hits the wealthiest 001% of households That however reflects a windfall for the state when it collects on decades of gains for the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk To pay the tax they may need to sell down stakes in their firms potentially remaking their ownership structures The government would cushion the blow by breaking payments into instalments spread over nine years at first and later five years Once established the revenues would be slimmer “The $360bn estimate makes it look more promising than it really is in the long run” says Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tankThere are two immediate obstacles As with every idea from the Biden White House the political question is whether Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema two moderate Democratic senators support it They have for different reasons opposed previous tax increases Then there are the courts The constitution limits the federal government to taxing incomes not wealth The White House would argue that accrued capital gains are a form of income but its proposal would face legal challengesEven if Mr Biden were to succeed in shepherding the tax into law another concern would emerge The levy would be complex especially for assets that do not trade in public markets Lawyers would devise new structures to shelter wealth “Their pencils are being sharpened even as we speak” says Joel Slemrod an economist at the University of Michigan For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Apr 2nd 2022,Can the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?,FIGHTING INFLATION gets harder the longer it is put offand the Federal Reserve has waited quite a while For most of 2021 the central bank said that it had the tools to slow price rises but saw no need to put them to use Now investors are coming to terms with the fact that the Fed will have to deploy them at scale Since March 1st the three-year Treasury yield has risen by more than a percentage point the biggest absolute change since yields collapsed in January 2008 during the global financial crisisListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe move reflects the emergence of expectations that the Fed will increase interest rates by another two percentage points this year having already raised them by a quarter of a point on March 16th The impact has been felt worldwide On March 28th the Bank of Japan promised to buy Japanese government debt in unlimited quantities over four days in order to defend its cap on the ten-year government-bond yield The yield on ten-year German bunds which turned positive only in January now stands at over 06% even as soaring energy prices darken the growth outlookThe most important question for bond investors in America is whether the higher interest rates that are arriving hard and fast can bring about a fabled “soft landing” in which the heat is taken out of the economy without provoking a recession Past experience suggests that this will be difficult; tightening has often preceded downturns Jerome Powell the Fed chairman has pointed to successful soft landings in 1964 1984 and 1993 But those comparisons do not account for the difficulty of the present situation In none of those cases did the Fed let inflation rise as far as it has todayThe central bank latest projections are rosy portraying what its critics have dubbed an “immaculate disinflation”: three years of steadily falling inflation despite GDP growth remaining above its long-run trend and both the unemployment rate and the Fed policy rate remaining unusually low Mr Powell may have given up calling inflation “transitory” but these forecasts make sense only if inflation goes away of its own accordIt seems likelier that the central bank will have to squeeze inflation out of the economy Noting that there is no precedent for doing so gracefully Bill Dudley a former head of the New York Fed wrote in a Bloomberg column on March 29th that a recession was now inevitable The r-word is also in the air because yields on some short-term bonds have risen above those on longer-term bonds Such a yield-curve “inversion” suggests that investors expect interest rates to be cut eventually as the economy weakensAn inverted yield curve is often regarded as a sign that markets think the central bank is making a mistake The uncomfortable truth however is that a recession and a mistake are not the same thing if causing a downturn is the only way to restore price stability In the 1980s Paul Volcker Fed vanquished inflation by inducing recessions that pushed the unemployment rate to 108% Nobody accuses it of having done so inadvertently; rather it chose to pay the high price of disinflation That is not a position in which today central bankers want to be; they talk as much about their duty to support jobs and growth as they do about ensuring stable pricesThe good news for Mr Powell is that for all the chatter about the yield curve investors remain mostly on his side Most economists put the neutral level of interest rates at which monetary policy is pressing on neither the accelerator nor the brake at around 2-25% Both the Fed and the bond market expect the policy rate to overshoot that level only slightly Rates a notch or two above neutral can hardly be compared with Volcker tightening The market expects immaculacy too believing that modestly tight money will be enough to control inflationThe recent predictive record of both central bankers and bond markets has been poor however Just a year ago the Fed message was that it was not even “talking about talking about” tightening monetary policy and investors expected consumer prices to rise by just 27% over the following year If they are caught out again the Fed could find that meeting its inflation target demands that it induce a recession The yield curve would then invert more steeplyIn that scenario America would pay a dear price for the glacial pace of action in 2021 which was justified ironically by the supposed dangers of sudden moves It has left the central bank the world economy and asset prices on more perilous groundRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The parallels between the nickel-trading fiasco and the LIBOR scandal Mar 26thCan foreign-currency reserves be sanction-proofed?

 Apr 2nd 2022,Will dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?,IN THE WAKE of an invasion that drew international condemnation Russian officials panicked that their dollar-denominated assets within America reach were at risk of abrupt confiscation sending them scrambling for alternatives The invasion in question did not take place in 2022 or even 2014 but in 1956 when Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary The event is often regarded as one of the factors that helped kick-start the eurodollar marketa network of dollar-denominated deposits held outside America and usually beyond the direct reach of its banking regulatorsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe irony is that the desire to keep dollars outside America only reinforced the greenback heft As of September banks based outside the country reported around $17trn in dollar liabilities twice as much as the equivalent for all the other currencies in the world combined Although eurodollar deposits are beyond Uncle Sam direct control America can still block a target access to the dollar system by making transacting with them illegal as its latest measures against Russia have doneThis fresh outbreak of financial conflict has raised the question of whether the dollar dominance has been tarnished and whether a multipolar currency system will rise instead with the Chinese yuan playing a bigger role To understand what the future might look like it is worth considering how the dollar role has evolved over the past two decades Its supremacy reflects more than the fact that America economy is large and its government powerful The liquidity flexibility and the reliability of the system have helped too and are likely to help sustain its global role In the few areas where the dollar has lost ground the characteristics that made it king are still being sought out by holders and usersand do not favour the yuanEurodollar deposits illustrate the greenback role as a global store of value But that is not the only thing that makes the dollar a truly international currency Its role as a unit of account in the invoicing of the majority of global trade may be its most overwhelming area of dominance According to research published by the IMF in 2020 over half of non-American and non-EU exports are denominated in dollars In Asian emerging markets and Latin America the share rises to roughly 75% and almost 100% respectively Barring a modest increase in euro invoicing by some European countries that are not part of the currency union these figures have changed little in the past two decadesAnother pillar of the dollar dominance is its role in cross-border payments as a medium of exchange A lack of natural liquidity for smaller currency pairs means that it often acts as a vehicle currency A Uruguayan importer might pay a Bangladeshi exporter by changing her peso into dollars and changing those dollars into taka rather than converting the currencies directlySo far there has been little shift away from the greenback: in February only one transaction in every five registered by the SWIFT messaging system did not have a dollar leg a figure that has barely changed over the past half-decade But a drift away is not impossible Smaller currency pairs could become more liquid reducing the need for an intermediary Eswar Prasad of Cornell University argues convincingly that alternative payment networks like China Cross-Border Interbank Payment System might undermine the greenback role He also suggests that greater use of digital currencies will eventually reduce the need for the dollar Those developed by central banks in particular could facilitate a direct link between national payment systemsPerhaps the best example in global finance of an area in which the dollar is genuinely and measurably losing ground is central banks’ foreign-exchange reserves Research published in March by Barry Eichengreen an economic historian at the University of California Berkeley shows how the dollar presence in central-bank reserves has declined Its share slipped from 71% of global reserves in 1999 to 59% in 2021 The phenomenon is widespread across a variety of central banks and cannot be explained away by movements in exchange ratesThe findings reveal something compelling about the dollar new competitors The greenback lost share has largely translated into a bigger share for what Mr Eichengreen calls “non-traditional” reserve currencies The yuan makes up only a quarter of this group share in global reserves The Australian and Canadian dollars by comparison account for 43% of it And the currencies of Denmark Norway South Korea and Sweden make up another 23% The things that unite those disparate smaller currencies are clear: all are floating and issued by countries with relatively or completely open capital accounts and governed by reliable political systems The yuan by contrast ticks none of those boxes “Every reserve currency in history has been a leading democracy with checks and balances” says Mr EichengreenBattle royalThough the discussion of whether the dollar might be supplanted by the yuan captures the zeitgeist of great-power competition the reality is more prosaic Capital markets in countries with predictable legal systems and convertible currencies have deepened and many offer better risk-adjusted returns than Treasuries That has allowed reserve managers to diversify without compromising on the tenets that make reserve currencies dependableMr Eichengreen research also speaks to a plain truth with a broader application: pure economic heft is not nearly enough to build an international currency system Even where the dollar dominance looks most like it is being chipped away the appetite for the yuan to take even a modest share of its place looks limited Whether the greenback retains its paramount role in the international monetary system or not the holders and users of global currencies will continue to prize liquidity flexibility and reliability Not every currency can provide them Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Have economists led the world environmental policies astray?

 Apr 2nd 2022,America gas frackers limber up to save Europe,“NO PAYMENT NO gas” growled a Russian government spokesman on March 29th Angered by the West economic sanctions President Vladimir Putin ordered that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas in roubles a demand that ministers from the G7 group of countries refused Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that Mr Putin would turn off the taps On March 30th Germany began bracing for the worst taking its first step towards gas rationing By the end of the day however the German government said it had received assurances that European firms would not have to make payments in roublesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven if an embargo has been averted the latest confrontation surely strengthens Europe desire to relax Mr Putin grip on the economy The EU has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year by two-thirds by the end of 2022 Ursula von der Leyen the head of the European Commission dreams that the EU can “get rid” of Russian imports entirely within a few years Can America one of the world largest natural-gas exporters help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas LNG from Americawhich it dubbed “molecules of freedom”the proposal was ridiculed Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a “groundbreaking” plan to help end the EU reliance on Russian gas It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG for Europe this year equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021 It also promises to “ensure additional EU market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year equivalent to 22bn cubic metres as prices soared on the continent America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use” reckons Rystad a research firm meaning that “there is no additional LNG to be exported” in the short term Jack Fusco boss of Cheniere a big American energy company confirms that his firm is “maxed out” It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals to change thatThere are also questions about whether the EU has the infrastructure to cope with the imports Receiving cargoes of LNG and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification Europe has spare capacity but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the EU where an embargo would hit hardest Germany which has no LNG terminals has vowed to build two but that will take several years Some European countries talk of acquiring floating LNG terminals which can be set up more quicklybut there is a severe global shortage of themLook to the longer term though and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise That is because the EU appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas The intent had been to promote competition but as last winter rocketing gas prices revealed it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock As a top American LNG exporter explains Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured “fantastic” long-term pricing insteadNow the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts “to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure” That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required boosting transatlantic trade Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie a consultancy reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe extra demand could be in the region of $35bnDiversification away from Russia in the long term then may be possible But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps considering he profits handsomely from high prices Energy Intelligence an industry publisher reckons Gazprom earned $205bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020 But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money

The growing number of millennials entering their buying years will keep momentum going and flexible work could continue to make cheaper areas more attractive The question is what happens to affordability Interest rates in many places are going up: the Federal Reserve expects to raise rates six more times this year That could cool demand and increase mortgage-servicing costs Rising interest rates in the 1980s for instance depressed housing markets just as baby-boomers reached their peak buying years The difference now though is that rates are low by historical standards and expected to rise only graduallySevere constraints on housing supply however may mean that affordability remains strained Shortages of labour and materials will make it harder for builders to put new homes on the market Record-low inventory and fierce bidding wars could mean fewer homes to choose from For some millennials the dream of home ownership may still prove out of reach For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

the IEA reckons that the market size of such green metals would increase almost seven-fold by 2030 And much like fossil-fuel reserves these commodities are distributed unevenly see chart 1 Some countries have none at all Others are blessed with vast depositsThe metals rush will not be as big as the oil-and-gas boom that toppled King Coal after the second world war But there are some echoes with the past Between 1940 and 1970 the share of hydrocarbons in the energy supply of rich countries rose from 26% to nearly 70% Once-marginal economies in the Middle East were transformed into uber-rich petrostates Between 1970 and 1980 the GDP per person of Qatar and Saudi Arabia grew 12- and 18-fold respectively Bedouin villages became boom towns; fishing dhows gave way to super tankers and luxury yachtsThis time the transition will bring windfalls to countries we dub the “green-commodity superpowers” We calculate that this club many of which are poor economies and autocracies could pocket more than $12trn in annual revenue from energy-related metals by 2040With the opportunity however come risks As the troubled mining projects in Russia show important investments can become victims of local conditions and geopolitics Huge rents could corrode domestic markets and political institutions; autocrats enriched by electrodollars could make mischief beyond their borders Saad Rahim of Trafigura a trading firm says the shift to clean fuels is “less an energy transition than a commodity transition” It will be a turbulent oneThe green boom is not just another “supercycle” as prolonged periods of high commodity prices are known The last such cycle early this century was fuelled by rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in China The combined real GDP of Brazil and Russia two resource-rich economies grew by two-thirds between 2000 and 2014 But the rally was largely driven by China alone When the country leaders decided it should build fewer factories and flats the commodity giants suffered The green transition by contrast stems from the decisions of many governments not one And decarbonising the world is likely to be the job of decadesAnother big difference lies in the materials in demand China splurge burned through heaps of coal iron and steel The green boom centres on non-ferrous metals that are more niche Their combined annual revenues today at $600bn is equivalent to only a fifth of that of the bulk materials that China favoured There may be more explosive growth to comeTo understand which commodity producers stand to win and lose from a green transition we construct a simple scenario for the use of ten “energy-linked” commodities in 2040 assuming that global warming by 2100 stays below 2°C Based on data from a range of industry sources we project demand and revenue for three fossil fuels oil gas coal and seven metals aluminium cobalt copper lithium nickel silver and zinc that are critical to building an electricity economy We assume that prices remain at today elevated levels prompting miners to exploit untapped deposits And we assume that a producer market share in 2040 is in line with its share of known reservesOur findings suggest the world will be less reliant on energy-related resources in 2040 than it is todaylargely because wind and sunshine the sources of the future are free Total spending on our basket of ten commodities falls to 34% of global GDP from 58% in 2021 Spending on fossil fuels relative to world GDP falls by half and would shrink further were it not for gas The revenue from green metals remains smaller but rises from 05% to 07% of GDP It nearly triples in absolute termsThe number of big producers of energy-linked commodities falls over time: 48 stand to pocket sales equivalent to more than 5% of their GDP down from 58 in 2021 see chart 2 More than half of total spending goes towards autocraciesYou can group producers into three buckets based on the expected change in their revenues from the ten energy-linked commodities between now and 2040 The first comprises the winnersthe green superpowers These electrostates include some rich democracies Australia has troves of every metal included in our sample Chile is home to 42% of the world lithium reserves and a quarter of its copper deposits much of them in the Atacama desert pictured above Others are autocracies Congo has 46% of global cobalt reserves and produces 70% of the world output today China is home to aluminium copper and lithium Poorer democracies in Asia and Latin America may also hit the jackpot Indonesia sits on mountains of nickel Peru holds nearly a quarter of the world silverThe second bucket comprises countries with revenues that stay flat or fall a little It includes the low-cost members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC including Iran Iraq and Saudi Arabiaand Russia Although oil revenue shrinks their share of it expands from 45% today to 57% in 2040 Other countries such as America Brazil and Canada lose fossil-fuel earnings but are able to tap vast mineral depositsHigher-cost petrostates lose the most Many oil-rich nations in north Africa Algeria Egypt sub-Saharan Africa Angola Nigeria and Europe Britain Norway see their revenues shrivel Small states like South Sudan Timor Leste and Trinidad have theirs hit hard The pain does not spare some Gulf states: the proceeds captured by Bahrain and Qatar for instance decline by a fifth or moreWhat might prevent the new commodity superpowers emerging?

 Mar 26th 2022,Three big uncertainties cloud the oil market,ALMOST A MONTH after Russia invasion of Ukraine sent the oil price surging turbulence in one of the world most crucial commodities markets shows little sign of coming to an end The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil surged to $121 on March 23rd as storm damage halted exports from a Russian pipeline Over the past fortnight it has whipsawed from a peak of $128 to as low as $98 The pandemic-related chaos of 2020 aside the OVX index of oil-market volatility has rarely been higher in the past decade than it has been this monthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe swings reflect the interplay between the geopolitical and economic forces buffeting the world today from war to rising interest rates and covid-19 Even beyond the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine there are three big sources of uncertainty for the oil market The first is what the members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC do as the West sanctions bite and Russian production is shunned America has banned imports of Russian oil; even in countries that have not taken that step prospective buyers are struggling to transact with the Russian financial intermediaries that have been cut off from the plumbing of global finance as a result of sanctions and may fear fresh sanctions to comeOn March 16th the International Energy Agency an official forecaster said that international markets could face a shortfall of 3m barrels of oil per day from April as a consequence The world consumed about 98m barrels a day last year The disruption in what was once a fluid global market is best illustrated by the gap between the prices of the Brent benchmark and Urals oil On January 31st it stood at about 60 cents per barrel By March 23rd it was around $30This leaves a great deal of power in the hands of the two countries that are most able to offset a chunk of the Russian shortfall: Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates So far both have resisted pleas to raise output substantially At a meeting in early March OPEC and its allies including Russia merely confirmed existing plans to raise overall output by 400000 barrels per day Their next gathering at the end of this month will be watched closely Even small shifts in public pronouncements have the potential to set off swings in the oil priceThe second seam of uncertainty relates to the capacity of American shale-oil production to meet the supply shortfall During the first fracking boom which lasted from around 2010 to 2015 American output surged causing the oil price to slump and weakening OPEC‘s hand But conditions in the American economy have changed dramatically since leaving analysts and industry insiders doubtful that shale can rise to the challengeFor a start financing conditions are less encouraging than they were during the boom in 2010-15 The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates several times this year and next: two-year Treasury yields are just above 2% compared with the sub-1% levels that persisted during most of the past boom Another constraint on production comes from America tight labour market Just over 128000 people were employed in oil-and-gas extraction in February down from more than 200000 at the height of the fracking boom in late 2014 With the headline unemployment rate at 38% and employers struggling to fill vacancies already finding several tens of thousands of workers to move across the country will be no mean featThe industry attitudes have also shifted Both American producers and their potential creditors are now far more cautious about borrowing Banks and asset managers are bound by stricter environmental standards That is one factor driving costs higher In the first quarter of 2022 energy-exploration and production firms reported the steepest increase in lease-operating expenses ie the recurring costs of operating wells in at least six years according to a survey by the Dallas Fed Drillers themselves having struggled to make consistent profits in the past are far keener on capital discipline this time tooThe third component of the volatility in the oil price is to do with demand China “zero-covid” strategy is being tested to an extreme degree The country has recorded its highest numbers of cases since the pandemic began and big cities are facing rolling lockdowns again Platts Analytics a commodities-research house suggests that the restrictions could cut oil demand by 650000 barrels per day in March roughly equivalent to Venezuela oil outputEven before the lockdowns began there were signs of a deceleration in China economy particularly in the property sector Any sign that the slowdown in the world biggest importer of energy is becoming broad-based would mean more tumult for commoditiesThe machinations of OPEC the shale calculus in America and the health of the Chinese economy: any one of these sources of uncertainty would usually be sufficient to generate price swings Together they make a flammable mix For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterEditor's note 21st March 2022: This piece was updated to reflect a change in oil prices

 Mar 26th 2022,Have economists led the world environmental policies astray?,IF THE WORLD economy fails to decarbonise it will not be because of the cost The gross investment needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 can seem enormous: a cumulative $275trn according to the McKinsey Global Institute a think-tank attached to the consultancy But over a period of decades the world would have had to replace its cars gas boilers and power plants anyway So the additional spending needed to go green is in fact much smaller: $25trn Spread that over many years and compare it to global GDP and it looks significant but manageable peaking at 14% between 2026 and 2035 And that is without counting the returns on the investment British officials reckon that three-quarters of the total cost of the transition to net zero will be offset by benefits such as more efficient transport and that the state may need to spend only 04% of GDP a year over three decadesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe challenge of getting to net zero therefore is not primarily budgetary but structural: how do you design politically viable policies to ensure the transition actually happens? That is the question Eric Lonergan an economist and fund manager and Corinne Sawers a climate consultant take on in their new book “Supercharge Me: Net Zero Faster”The authors are not kind to economists who typically want to put a price on emissions and then let markets do the work Economists have the authors allege skipped a chapter in the textbooks They have focused on externalities the damage done to society when carbon is emitted But they do not think about the elasticity of demandthe extent to which prices change behaviourCarbon prices do not alter people choices much when there are too few substitutes for dirty goods or when those substitutes are too expensive High fuel taxes for example tend to provoke a political backlash against environmentalismthink of France gilets jaunesbut do not much alter transport emissions Britain has had one of the highest levels of fuel duty in the rich world in recent decades note Mr Lonergan and Ms Sawers but drivers’ take-up of electric vehicles has been unremarkableThe authors argue that getting people to make the big leaps needed to decarbonise such as buying an electric car or installing a domestic heat pump instead requires “extreme positive incentives for change” EPICs They laud Norway for exempting electric vehicles from road tax cutting their parking charges in half and giving them access to bus lanes More than 90% of cars sold in the country are now electric They propose big mortgage discounts for homeowners who retrofit their properties And they want the state to generously subsidise lending to green projects while exempting them from a range of taxes “To succeed we have to fight on all fronts” they writeTheir assault on carbon pricing is not entirely without merit The theoretical attraction of the policy is that it leads the market to discover the cheapest ways to cut emissions where behaviour is easily changed while allowing other parts of the economy to choose to pay the toll Economists in Barack Obama White House were among those who puzzled over the “social cost of carbon”the optimal carbon price that would deter some emissions but not those that were sufficiently beneficial to the economy to offset their effect on global temperaturesBut in a world of fixed-date net-zero targets this sort of logic loses power Such goals concern all pollution not just that which is easily abated Saying there is a maximum permissible amount of global warming of 15-2°C above pre-industrial levelsthe targets in the Paris agreementis like saying there is a point at which the social cost of carbon is infinite In this world policymakers are not setting a carbon price to distinguish between emissions They are trying to change behaviour It may be that EPICs or investments in green technology are a more politically viable route to doing so than raising the carbon price to whatever level is necessary to extinguish inelastic demand for fossil fuelsYet the authors push their criticism of carbon prices too far They praise Britain adoption of wind power but fail to note the role that its “carbon price floor” a minimum levy bolted on to the EU emissions-trading scheme played in the transition They lament the “complexity” of carbon taxation while also advocating a fiddly green corporate tax And they fail to notice the flawed political economy of their kitchen-sink approach For example they call on central banks to provide the green subsidies they desire To whom would the central bank be accountable? And once the principle that monetary policy does not allocate capital is conceded what is to stop other demands being made on it? Carbon pricing is simple and transparent by comparisonCasting the net wideMoreover there is an important role for carbon pricing even in a net-zero world One area of technological possibility concerns the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The potential for “direct air capture” or a well-governed market for carbon offsets such as planting trees restores the logic of using carbon prices to discriminate between emissions as well as simply deterring them If such advances materialise the carbon price might eventually be the exact cost of extracting carbon from the atmosphere with the market determining the size of the gross flows on either side of the net-zero ledgerEven if Mr Lonergan and Ms Sawers are right that some EPICs are needed to make the journey to net zero politically easier then economists’ long-standing arguments for carbon pricing still have considerable merit And the world has been slowly coming round: in 2021 more than 20% of greenhouse-gas emissions were covered by a carbon-pricing scheme up from about 5% a decade ago The path to net zero will involve more than set-it-and-forget-it carbon pricing But economists’ favourite climate-change policy remains an essential one Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:The disturbing new relevance of theories of nuclear deterrence Mar 19thHow oil shocks have become less shocking Mar 12thVladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling Mar 5thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 19th 2022,Governments are proposing windfall taxes on energy firms,ON MARCH 8th the day the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil spiked above $127 the European Commission unveiled its grand plan to fight stratospheric living costs Claiming that the “crisis situation” warranted exceptional measures it recommended that member states levy a one-off tax on electricity-generating firms The revenues raised could then be used to keep households’ bills down The next day Elizabeth Warren a senator from Massachusetts tweeted that she and other legislators were working on a tax on the “war-fuelled profits” accruing to American oil majors The proposal is now making its way through the House of RepresentativesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPoliticians have reached for such “windfall” taxes before Bulgaria Italy Romania and Spain have imposed them on power generators in recent months as benchmark energy prices have risen America began taxing oil producers in 1980 hoping to cash in on profits that were expected to be made after prices were deregulated Britain new Labour government taxed utilities in 1997 after the Conservative government had sold them off cheaplyThe levies are understandably tempting for the taxman Big windfalls mean big receipts The usual worry with a tax is that it might change companies’ behaviour say by encouraging them to lower investment in order to bring down future tax bills But the event causing the windfall is meant to be a one-off unconnected to investment They are “extremely efficient ways to raise revenue” says Helen Miller of the Institute for Fiscal Studies a think-tank in London At least in theoryBritain tax probably fitted the ideal better than most It had a clear rationale: that excess gains had come from the underpricing of shares when firms were privatised Post-privatisation profits were multiplied by a price-to-earnings ratio; a 23% tax was levied on what was left over once public proceeds from privatisation were subtracted Even then however the tax failed to target the beneficiaries of excess gains British Telecom the first utility to be privatised had listed in 1984 Many early punters had come and gone leaving shareholders in 1997 bearing the burdenLevies elsewhere have faced other hurdles In 2006 Mongolia introduced a 68% charge on profits from copper and gold sales hoping to cash in on a new mine during a commodity-price boom Instead investors withheld funds for the project until regulators agreed to drop the tax America tax did distort firms’ behaviour by some estimates reducing oil production between 1980 and 1986 by up to 48%The European Commission plan has its flaws It does not explain why the current situation warrants a one-off tax adding uncertainty about when such levies might be used again Furthermore the energy industry buys and sells power using long-term contracts making the link between today prices and tomorrow profits fuzzy And prices can fall as quickly as they rise By March 16th for instance the oil price was back to about $100 a barrelRecent experiments offer scant grounds for optimism Romania Italy and Spain are targeting renewable-power generators which have not experienced the same increase in costs as generators that use fossil fuels Richard Howard of Aurora Energy a consultancy says that this raises the “risk premium” of investing in renewablesexactly what legislators want to avoid Peter Styles of the European Federation of Energy Traders a trade body notes that Spain scheme stops green-energy generators accruing excess profits to begin with which will distort the way prices are set in the marketTheir momentum across Europe also creates a fiscal opening that may be hard to close The commission recommends that all windfall taxes should be wound down by the end of June But Spain has already extended its clawbacks once And Italy measures will last until December Correction: An earlier version of this article said that America's tax on oil producers was implemented in 1986 In fact it began in 1980 SorryFor more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Mar 19th 2022,The disturbing new relevance of theories of nuclear deterrence,SIXTY YEARS ago a dispute over the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba pushed Washington and Moscow perilously close to all-out war The crisis provided history most extreme example yet of nuclear brinkmanship situations in which governments repeatedly escalate a very dangerous situation in an attempt to get their way It also demonstrated the extraordinary value of the work of Thomas Schelling an economist then at Harvard University who used the relatively new tools of game theory to analyse the strategy of war The war in Ukraine has made Schelling work for which he shared the economics Nobel prize in 2005 more relevant than everListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGame theory came into its own in the 1940s and 1950s thanks to the efforts of scholars like John von Neumann and John Nash who used mathematics to analyse the strategies available to participants in various sorts of formal interactions Schelling used game theory as a prism through which to better understand war He considered conflict as an outcome of a strategic showdown between rational decision-makers who weighed up the costs and benefits of their choices If a would-be attacker expects to gain more from aggression than any cost his adversary can impose on him then he is likely to go through with the aggressive actFor a government hoping to deter an aggressor the effectiveness of its deterrence strategy thus depends in part on the size of the retaliatory costs it can inflict on its attacker But this is not an exact science Both sides may have incomplete information about the relative costs they can expect to bear When Vladimir Putin Russia president was preparing his invasion of Ukraine for example Western democracies threatened to impose stiff sanctions Just how tough the sanctions could be was not necessarily knowable to either side beforehand because the details needed to be negotiated with alliesThe credibility of retaliatory threats matters as well; both sides of a potential conflict may issue grave threats but if they ring hollow they may be ignored The threat of stiff sanctions by Western democraciesclearly a powerful tool in hindsightmight well have been weakened by doubts that governments were prepared to expose their citizens to soaring oil and gas prices Governments deploy a range of tools to bolster the credibility of their threats An American promise to defend an ally may be strengthened by the placement of American troops within the ally borders in harm way for instance; an American president would presumably find it more difficult to back down in the face of an attack that claimed American lives Schelling for his part noted that credibility can sometimes be enhanced by taking costly actions or limiting your own options A general promise to fight to the bitter end if an enemy does not withdraw becomes more credible if he burns the bridges that provide his own avenue of retreatThe problem of credibility becomes far more complicated in a showdown between nuclear-armed powers which both have sufficient weaponry to retaliate against any first strike with a devastating attack of their own If the first use of nuclear weapons is all but assured to bring ruin on one own country as well then efforts to use the threat of nuclear attack to extract concessions are likelier to fail Wars may nonetheless occur The invasion of Ukraine could be seen as an example of the stability-instability paradox: because the threat of a nuclear war is too terrible to contemplate smaller or proxy conflicts become “safer” because rival superpowers feel confident that neither side will allow the fight to escalate too much Some scholars reckon this helps to account for the many smaller wars that occurred during the cold warAnd yet the cold war also threatened to turn hot at times as in 1962 Schelling helped explain why He noted that the threat of a nuclear attack could be made credible even in the context of mutually assured destruction if some element of that threat was left to chance As a showdown between nuclear powers becomes more intense Schelling observed the risk that unexpected and perhaps undesired developments cause the situation to spiral out of control rises When nuclear forces are on high alert for instance false alarms become far more dangerous The upper hand in such a situation is thus maintained by the side that is more willing to tolerate this heightened risk of all-out nuclear warThis is the essence of brinkmanship It is not merely a matter of ratcheting up the tension in the hope of outbluffing the other side It is also a test of resolvewhere resolve is defined as a willingness to bear the risk of a catastrophe Mr Putin move to increase the readiness of his nuclear forces may represent an attempt to demonstrate such resolve over and above the message sent by the invasion itself President Joe Biden refusal to escalate in kind could be seen as an acknowledgment of the conspicuous fact that an autocrat embroiled in a pointless war has less to lose than the rich democracy to which Mr Biden is accountableThe only winning moveIt could be however that Mr Biden had something else in mind In his Nobel lecture Schelling wondered at the fact that nuclear weapons had not been used over the 60 years that had elapsed since the end of the second world war While he chalked up the absence of nuclear use between superpowers to deterrence he reckoned that in other wars and confrontations restraint was best understood as resulting from a taboo: a social convention that stayed belligerents’ hands when they might otherwise have deemed it strategically sensible to deploy nuclear weaponsRussia aggression has shattered another taboo against territorial aggrandisement through violence And though the governments of the West feel compelled to respond to limit the damage that has caused they are no doubt also keen to restore the old conventionto demonstrate that the world has moved beyond an age where the mighty take by force whatever they want Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How oil shocks have become less shocking Mar 12thVladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling Mar 5thHow to avoid a fatal backlash against globalisation Feb 26thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis
 Mar 19th 2022,Sanctions-dodgers hoping to use crypto to evade detection are likely to be disappointed,TO THEIR CHAMPIONS cryptocurrencies are supposed to be a libertarian Utopia Because tokens are created and moved by loose decentralised networks of individual computers based in dozens of countries cross-border transactions can be quick and in theory are free from control by intermediaries such as banks which can be regulated by national governments Critics of crypto-finance have long looked askance at the same system To statists it represents the tyranny of techno-anarchyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia invasion of Ukraine and the West subsequent sanctions on Russian banks companies and elites appears to turn on its head the debate about whom crypto helps and hurts Though politicians and regulators in America and Europe at first feared that people and entities hit with sanctions would use cryptocurrencies to dodge the restrictions little evidence of such activity has materialised Instead crypto institutions appear to be under the thumb of governments too And there has been a huge surge in crypto donations to help the government in UkraineCrypto decentralised network is supposed to be supranational and its users are meant to be anonymous This makes it seem like a useful tool for sanctions-dodging Certainly there is evidence that Russians have been buying more crypto But this may stem from a desire to hold an asset that is not plunging in value The rouble has tumbled by about 25% against the dollar since February 23rd whereas bitcoin has risen against the greenback For oligarchs looking to dodge sanctions though crypto has three main flawsThe first is that the infrastructure such as large exchanges does not really exist in Russia “Had the Russians wanted to use blockchain infrastructure for sanctions evasion they would have had to have taken a very different regulatory approach” says Tomicah Tillemann a former staffer for President Joe Biden who now advises Katie Haun a crypto-focused venture capitalist “Russia along with a number of other authoritarian societies has been pretty hostile to digital assets” Thus Russians’ ability to convert significant amounts of wealth into crypto is limitedThe second flaw is that it is not possible to buy most everyday items or financial assets with crypto which means that a sanctions-dodger must at some point leave the crypto-sphere “Ultimately what they really need to do is get access to some form of fiat currency which becomes more challenging” said Christopher Wray the head of the FBI in a US Senate hearing on the Russian invasion on March 10th That requires interacting with a crypto-exchangeThough early iterations of some exchanges resisted the need to implement “know your customer” KYC anti-money-laundering measures many have acquiesced as they have become regulated institutions Some are publicly listed Most have a presence in America and Europe Binance the largest exchange implemented a KYC policy in 2021 requiring those using it to identify themselves to the firmThe message from regulators to exchanges has been unanimous America Treasury has stressed that its sanctions apply “whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency” a message reinforced by an executive order on digital currency from Mr Biden on March 9th The White House has also issued a statement with the leaders of other G7 countries and the EU vowing to “impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth” The crypto industry has rushed to accommodate these requests Coinbase another large exchange has frozen 25000 Russian accounts Binance has said it will freeze the assets of people who have been targeted with sanctionsThe third problem is that moving money around in crypto is not as private as is widely thought Government sleuths have invested time and energy in trying to link supposedly anonymous wallets with real people with some success And as blockchain transactions are public once identified it is easy to trace the history of funds In December the FBI managed to seize $36bn-worth of crypto-assets related to a theft from an exchange in 2016Crypto may turn out to be far more useful to those looking to move in the open rather than in the shadows On February 26th the official Ukrainian Twitter account published digital-wallet addresses through which it is accepting bitcoin ether and other tokens Donations quickly flooded in “Crypto really helped during the first few days because we were able to cover some immediate needs” says Alex Bornyakov Ukraine deputy minister for digital transformation Nearly $100m-worth of tokens has since been donated to those and other wallets set up by private initiativesGetting money to war zones is notoriously hard In 2008 Mr Tillemann visited Tbilisi in Georgia with Mr Biden then a senator in the middle of Russia invasion of the country “It became very obvious that we were going to have real challenges getting in resources” he says Donors were forced to ship pallets of $100 bills into war zones in Iraq and AfghanistanMoving money out of war zones to buy supplies can be just as difficult In the chaos of the war it became increasingly difficult to pay in dollars or euros especially abroad “So we needed a tool to quickly perform those transactions And crypto was our first choice” says Mr Bornyakov Although most suppliers did not operate in crypto they agreed to accept it he says Ukraine has spent some $30m on things like bulletproof vests night-vision goggles and medicines Around a fifth of that was spent directly in cryptoThe war has made it clear that there are serious uses for crypto But it is now policed seriously

 Mar 19th 2022,A nickel-trading fiasco raises three big questions,THE TRADING of commodities is an arcane activity that makes it into the public eye only at times of extreme hubris That is when names like the Hunt brothers who tried to corner the silver market in 1980 and Hamanaka Yasuo or “Mr Copper” who in 1996 produced huge losses for Sumitomo a Japanese trading house became household ones Xiang Guangda a Chinese tycoon known as “Big Shot” vaulted into the news this month by taking a position on nickel that went badly wrong The result has been one of the biggest tremors in the 145-year history of the London Metal Exchange LME It has also brought China which is keen to exert more power over the trading of commodities face to face with free markets gone madListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the cloistered world of the LME some facts about the affair are clear One is that nickel prices already hot before Russia invasion of Ukraine surged after the West imposed sanctions on Russia Another is that Mr Xiang firm Tsingshan had exposure to short positions on the LME of about 180000 tonnes of nickel which were supposed to benefit if prices went down They didn’t as a short-covering scramble for nickel briefly pushed prices above $100000 a tonne on March 8th putting Tsingshan potential losses into the billions of dollars At that point the LME suspended nickel trading cancelling all trades that took place overnight When the suspension was lifted on March 16th a sharp drop in nickel prices forced the LME to suspend trading again adding to the chaosThree big questions remain How important is Tsingshan role in the debacle? Did its troubles provoke interference from China? And has the LME bungled its response? All will be the subject of scrutinyIn media reports Tsingshan has the lead role in the drama There is debate about whether its short-selling represented the normal activity of one of the world largest nickel producers hedging its output or a speculator making a rash bet What appears clear is that the nickel it produces is not the type of metallic nickel that is traded on the LME meaning there was a mismatch between its shorts and longs As its losses increased its brokers forced it to provide more cash or “margin” The size of its position meant that they also faced big margin calls making it as much their problem as Tsingshan On March 15th Tsingshan said it had reached a standstill agreement with its creditors until it reduces its positions in an orderly wayIn the market rumours abound that China may have influenced the LME activities partly because Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing HKEX owns the exchange and also because Tsingshan is strategically important to the country because its nickel goes into electric-vehicle batteries The LME denies receiving pressure from HKEX It granted extra time on March 7th to CCBI Global a Chinese broker for Tsingshan that is a member of the LME to raise funds from its state-owned parent China Construction Bank to cover margin calls That may have been a prudent thing to do It knew the wealthy bank could provide the funds Some traders wonder whether it would have been as tolerant with a non-Chinese entity In the aftermath Chinese authorities are said to have fought hard to stop Tsingshan nickel assets falling into the hands of non-Chinese speculatorsThe most intense scrutiny may fall on the LME itself specifically the timing of its decision to suspend nickel trading and the cancelling of overnight trades that were rumoured to be in the billions of dollars It said it halted trading in the early hours of March 8th when it reckoned the nickel market had become disorderly It added that its decision to cancel that day trades was because the big price moves had created a systemic risk to the market raising concerns of multiple defaults by member-brokers struggling to meet margin callsThat latter decision is the biggest bone of contention Critics say it favoured those with short positions such as physical producers and their banks over those with long positions that could be sold at a big profit They ask why it stepped in to protect brokers when the LME has a default fund that its members can get access to in times of trouble “The decision to erase the trades…will undermine long-term confidence in the LME” says Yao Hua Ooi of AQR an asset manager that had trades cancelled on March 8th “If you want the AQRs of this world [in the market] you cannot intervene when they make money and it hurts your brokers” He said the firm was exploring all options against the LMEThe LME has since set daily limits on price moves which were exceeded on March 16th when it briefly reopened nickel trading That is another sign of intervention by an exchange that used to pride itself on its free-market nature Its owner in Hong Kong with China looking over its shoulder would no doubt approve 
 Mar 19th 2022,Can foreign-currency reserves be sanction-proofed?,CRYPTO INVESTORS sometimes say they have been “rugged” when the developers of a coin vanish along with the capital that has been allocated to it pulling the rug out from under them Foreign-exchange reserve managers might never have expected to recognise the feeling But almost as soon as Russia invaded Ukraine American and European authorities froze the assets of the Central Bank of Russia As others followed the country first line of financial defence was obliterated According to the Russian government $300bn of its $630bn in reserves are now unusableListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe managers of the $137trn in global foreign-exchange reserves are a conservative breed They care about liquidity and safety above all else largely to the exclusion of profits Much of their thinking was shaped by the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 when currencies collapsed in the face of huge capital outflows The lesson learned was that reserves needed to be plentiful and liquidWatching a big chunk of Russia reserves being made functionally useless is likely to be just as formative even for those who face no immediate prospect of a terminal rift with the world financial superpowers That is particularly true for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange SAFE the agency in charge of China $34trn in reserves India and Saudi Arabia with $632bn and $441bn in reserves respectively may also be paying close attentionBarry Eichengreen an economic historian has described the choice of the composition of foreign-exchange reserves as being guided by either a “Mercury” or a “Mars” principle The Mercurial approach bases reserves on commercial links; the currencies being held are largely determined by their usefulness for trade and finance A Martian strategy bases the composition more on factors like security and geopolitical alliancesMars seems to be in the ascendant Central banks are bound to take into account which countries will and will not replicate sanctions against them In 2020 Guan Tao a former SAFE official now at Bank of China International laid out a range of ways that China could guard against the risk of sanctions In extremis he suggested that the dollar could stop being used as the anchor currency for foreign-exchange management and be replaced by a basket of currenciesEven that option which might have sounded extreme a month ago now falls short of what a Martian central bank would need given the degree of co-operation with American sanctions There are few if any jurisdictions with large liquid capital markets denominated in currencies that are useful in an emergency but which do not pose a risk from a sanctions perspective Some worried central banks might start increasing their holdings of yuan assets which currently make up less than 3% of the global total But that is no solution for China itselfWhy not go back to basics? Gold the original reserve asset is a large liquid market outside any one jurisdiction control Researchers at Citigroup a bank estimate that most of the reserves that Russia can currently marshal are in gold and the Chinese yuan Yet the West sanctions are so expansive that they prohibit many potential buyers from purchasing the assets Russia has accumulated over the years Even a would-be counterparty in a neutral or friendly country will think twice about transacting with a central bank under sanctions if it risks their own access to the financial plumbing of the dollar systemThere has been more adventurous speculation too Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse a bank has suggested that China sell Treasuries in order to lease ships and buy up Russian commodities arguing that the global monetary system is shifting from one backed by government bonds to one that is backed by commodities Bold as the forecast is it is also emblematic of the few conventional options available to reserve managersAnd that lack of good solutions points to another drastic approach: that countries limit their use of reserves for their financial defence altogether Various tools of autarky such as tighter capital controls could become more attractive Governments also typically rely on reserves as the last guarantee that they can service foreign-currency debts But if that guarantee is no longer absolute then they are less likely to be comfortable issuing dollar- and euro-denominated bonds at all Private companies may be prodded to de-dollarise too If you don’t invest in the first place you won’t be ruggedRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Iran flourishing stockmarket reflects its resilient economy Mar 12thInvestors are terrible at forecasting wars Mar 5thThe many virtues of the yen the rich world cheapest currency Feb 26thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 19th 2022,Globalisation and autocracy are locked together For how much longer?,THE WORLD’S supply chains have taken a knock yet again Russia invasion of Ukraine provoked the biggest commodity shock since 1973 and one of the worst disruptions to wheat supplies in a century Countries from Hungary to Indonesia are banning food exports to ensure supply at home The West has issued sanctions against Russia depriving it of all sorts of parts and technologiesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe strain on globalisation comes on top of the effects of the financial crisis of 2007-09 Brexit President Donald Trump and the pandemic For years measures of global integration have gone south Between 2008 and 2019 world trade relative to global GDP fell by about five percentage points Tariffs and other barriers to trade are piling up Global flows of long-term investment fell by half between 2016 and 2019 Immigration is lower too and not just because of border closuresThe war in Ukraine stands to accelerate another profound shift in global trade flows by pitting large autocracies against liberal democracies Such confrontation happened during the cold war too But this time autocracies are bigger richer and more technologically sophisticated Their share in global output trade and innovation has risen and they are key links in many supply chains Attempts to drift apart therefore will bring new consequences and costs for the world economyAfter the second world war democracies ruled the economic roost In 1960 America Britain Canada France Italy and Japan accounted for about 40% of global exports Autocracies by contrast were economically unimportant on the world stage The Soviet Union accounted for 4% of global trade; China barely featured in the statistics Average GDP per head across the communist bloc was a tenth of America The West was locked in a fierce ideological battle with communist countries filled with proxy wars and nuclear scares But in economic terms there was no contestTheir economies were also largely unintegrated One observer in the late 1950s reckoned that trade between the USSR and America was so small that a big shipment could double the total from one month to another The exceptions in east-west tradea bit of Russian gas to Europe; a wheat deal in 1972; a vodka-for-Pepsi swap from 1974were few A study published by the IMF days before the Soviet Union fell said that “foreign direct investment in the USSR has been minimal to date”The communist bloc played by its own rules Soviet external economic activity largely took place within COMECON a group of sympathetic countries China and the USSR barely traded with each other from the late 1950s having fallen out Trade in COMECON took place not via money-for-stuff but in the form of a peculiar system of barteroil for manufactured goods sayagreed by governmentsFrom the late 1970s onwards autocratic regimes began to open up In part this was the result of an ideological change first apparent in China The death of Chairman Mao in 1976 allowed hitherto heretical views to emerge “Unless it could expand and modernise its economy more rapidly than it had done in previous decades China would remain poor weak and vulnerable” wrote Aaron Friedberg of Princeton University in a paper published in 2018 describing the ideas of Deng Xiaoping the leader who spearheaded China opening up in the 1980s A focus on class struggle gave way to a desire for modernisation and development Further momentum for globalisation came from the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991The West on the whole welcomed and encouraged economic liberalisation believing that it could be a force for good and for large profits By bringing countries into the global trading system it would be possible to raise living standards as well as foster democracy and freedom A globalised world would also be a more peaceful one the argument wentIn the 1990s globalisation took off Trade boomed Annual global flows of foreign direct investment FDI including purchases of companies and the construction of new factories rose by a factor of six In 1990 Russia first McDonald opened in Moscow; KFC set up shop a few years later Russian oil companies began directing their exports towards the West Between 1985 and 2015 Chinese goods exports to America rose by a factor of 125Living standards certainly went up The number of people living in extreme poverty has fallen by 60% since 1990 Some formerly closed countries have utterly changed The average Estonian is now only marginally poorer than the average ItalianThe other hoped-for benefit of globalisationpolitical liberalisationhas faltered however Our World in Data a research organisation puts countries into four groups ranging from most to least free: “liberal democracies” such as America and Japan; more flawed “electoral democracies” such as Poland and Sri Lanka; “electoral autocracies” such as Turkey and Hungary; and “closed autocracies” such as China and Vietnam where citizens have no real choice over their leaderClassifying political regimes is not an exact science and involves making assumptions and judgments Our World In Data counts India as an electoral autocracy since 2019 for instance which some other sources do not agree with Nonetheless it helps give an idea of a broader trend: the waning might of liberal democraciesThe share of political regimes that were liberal democracies rose from 11% in 1970 to 23% in 2010 But democracy has retrenched since Most of the 19bn people living in closed autocracies now reside in just one country: China But lesser forms of autocracy are on the rise such as in Turkey where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has consolidated power during his two decades in office see chart 1Using data from the World Bank the IMF and elsewhere we divide the global economy into two We estimate that today the autocratic world ie closed and electoral autocracies accounts for over 30% of global GDP more than double its share at the end of the cold war Its share of global exports has soared over that period The combined market value of its listed firms represented just 3% of the global total in 1989 Now it represents 30% see chart 2China is by far the biggest non-democracy in economic terms with a dollar GDP roughly two-thirds of America making up over half of our group of autocracies But others such as Turkey the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam have also gained in economic clout over the past 30 yearsAutocracies are now an especially serious rival to democracies when it comes to investment and innovation In 2020 their governments and firms invested $9trn in everything from machinery and equipment to the construction of roads and railways Democracies invested $12trn Autocracies received more FDI than democracies between 2018 and 2020 And since the mid-1990s their share of patent applications has gone from 5% to over 60% China dominates patenting but on almost all our other measures the economic power of autocracies has soared even after China is excluded from our calculationsMany autocracies have remained steadfastly mercantilist China for instance opened its domestic markets where it suited it but kept whole sectors closed off to allow domestic champions to rise Nonetheless autocracies have become integrated with democracies to an extent that would have been unthinkable during the cold war Vietnam which has been ruled by a single party for decades for instance has become a pivotal link in the global manufacturing supply chain The kingdoms and emirates of the Middle East are vital sources of oil and gasWe estimate that roughly one-third of democracies’ goods imports come from other political regimes The codependency in some markets is clear Democracies produce about two-thirds of the oil necessary to meet their daily needs The rest must come from somewhere else Half of the coffee that fills Europeans’ cups comes from places where people have weak political rights And that is before getting to precious metals and rare earthsIntegration goes far beyond trade American multinationals employ 3m people outside democracies a rise of 90% in the past decade their total foreign employment has increased by a third Investors from democracies hold over a third of the autocratic world total stock of inward FDI Autocracies have built up huge foreign reserves now worth more than $7trn and often denominated in “free” currencies like the dollar and the euroBroken dreamThis intimacy is now under threat as a third darker period comes into view Even before the war in Ukraine powerful countries were losing interest in a truly global presence Instead they were seeking to rely more on themselves or to dominate their immediate geographical area Their new thinking is becoming increasingly enshrined in strategy and policyThe waning appetite for globalisation has a few causes One relates to greater consumer awareness in the West about human-rights abuses in places such as China and Vietnam Polls in Western countries regularly find that a high share of respondents support boycotting Chinese goods whether they would actually do so is another matter Western companies are being pressed to source goods elsewhere Concerns over the national-security implications of trade and investment including industrial espionage have also risenAutocracies have their own worries One is that too much integration can cause Western culture to seep across borders weakening autocratic rule Deng himself identified the dilemma: “If you open the window for fresh air you have to expect some flies to blow in”Another bigger worry relates to power Being part of global supply chains means being vulnerable to sanctions This was clear from an early stage In 1989 China faced sanctions after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square The next year America placed Cuba El Salvador Jordan Kenya Romania and Yemen under sanctions for various infractions Several rounds of Western sanctions on Russia first in 2014 and then again today bring the message home still more forcefullyAlready there is evidence of a crude decoupling In 2014 America banned Huawei a Chinese tech firm from bidding on American government contracts In 2018 Mr Trump started a trade war with China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what America said were “unfair trade practices” including the theft of intellectual property FDI flows between China and America are now just $5bn a year down from nearly $30bn five years agoRecent policy announcements and trade deals shed some light on the probable direction of globalisation as the world most powerful democracies and autocracies turn away from each other Countries are signing smaller regional trade deals instead; democracies are banding together as are autocracies; and many countries are also seeking greater self-relianceBegin with regional trade deals the number of which is booming In 2020 China signed an agreement with 14 other Asian countries mostly non-democracies In that year the ASEAN group of South-East Asian countries became China biggest trading partner replacing the EU In Africa meanwhile most countries have ratified the African Continental Free Trade AreaCountries with shared political systems are also coming closer The CoRe Partnership an agreement between America and Japan launched last year and is designed to promote co-operation in new technologies from mobile networks to biotech The US-EU Trade and Technology Council the pointed ambition of which is to promote “the spread of democratic market-oriented values” is working on climate change and strengthening supply chainsAutocracies are also forming their own blocs The stock of long-term investment from the autocratic world into China rose by over a fifth in 2020 even as the amount of investment from autocracies into America barely budged Saudi Arabia is reportedly mulling selling oil to China in yuan rather than dollars Long-term investment from autocracies into increasingly illiberal India rose by 29% in 2020Large countries in particular meanwhile are also turning inward A big focus of President Joe Biden administration for instance is “supply-chain resilience” which in part involves efforts to encourage domestic production China turn in 2020 towards a “dual circulation” strategy includes an attempt to rely less on global suppliers It wants to release its rivals’ grip on “chokehold” industries such as chipmaking equipment which it fears could be used to strangle its rise India too has turned towards self-relianceMany of these efforts could come at a price Autocracies are notoriously prone to pursuing their own self-interests rather than banding together History shows that withdrawing from global trade and investment networks carries huge costs In 1808 America came close to autarky as a result of a self-imposed embargo on international shipping Research by Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth College suggests that the ban cost about 8% of America gross national product More recently many studies have found that it was primarily American firms that paid for Mr Trump tariffs Brexit has slowed growth and investment in BritainRussia attempt at self-reliance by pursuing import substitution on a large scale building up foreign-exchange reserves and developing parallel technological networks shows just how hard it is to cut yourself off from the global economy Sanctions by the West rendered much of its reserves useless overnight The economy was struggling even before the war and has since gone off a cliff Unemployment is likely to soar as foreign firms leave the countryThe risk though is that countries draw the opposite lesson from Russia: that less integration rather than more is the best way to protect themselves from economic pain The world would become more fractured and mutually suspiciousnot to mention poorer than it could have been For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Mar 19th 2022,The inflationary consequences of Russia war will spread,LAST SUMMER amid mounting alarm about inflation in America economic advisers in the White House penned a blog post in which they examined historical parallels Although the press was full of comparisons with oil shocks in the 1970s they wrote that a nearer relative was the dislocation after the second world war when supply shortages interacted with pent-up demand It was a well-reasoned argument But the surge in commodity prices over the past month in the wake of Russia invasion of Ukraine gives rise to an unsettling question: is the global economy now seeing a 1970s-style price shock on top of a late-1940s-style supply crunch?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo be sure no serious economist expects inflation in the rich world to reach the giddy double-digit heights of those episodes On March 16th the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 kicking off a tightening cycle that it expects to continue well into next year Moreover the retreat in oil markets in recent days could offer reliefNevertheless surging prices for everything from wheat to nickel threaten to add to inflation And rolling lockdowns in parts of China could exacerbate strains on global supply chains Consumer-price inflation in America already stood at a 40-year high in February at 79% year on year; the rate in the euro area meanwhile exceeded 5%Investors are still far from persuaded that central bankers are on top of the problem The most striking evidence is the inflation expectations that can be found in fixed-income markets in America ICE a financial firm distils a few different numbers including yields on inflation-protected bonds and interest-rate swaps into short-term and long-term indices for gauging expectations In late January the expected rate of inflation over the next year was 35% On March 15th it stood at 54% Expectations in the euro area have seen similar if slightly steeper trends The one-year inflation swap rate rose to 59% on March 8th see chart 2Markets are inherently volatile so deriving inflation predictions from bond yields should be taken with a pinch of salt But the shift in prices is broadly in line with what economists are forecasting Last week Bank of America raised its inflation forecasts for much of the world In America it now expects inflation over 2022 as a whole to average 7% up from its prior forecast of 63% In the euro zone it sees an even bigger increase with inflation averaging 6% this year well above its previous forecast of 44% The challenge is greater for Europe because of its high dependency on Russia which supplies about 45% of its gas importsIn an indication of just how pervasive the pressures are likely to be economists are even ratcheting up their inflation forecasts for Japan where deflation has long been the bigger threat On March 8th S&P a rating agency said that Japanese inflation would average 2% this year more than double its previous prediction So far forecasters expect a relatively modest increase in overall inflation in emerging markets But rising food costs will be especially damaging for their poorest citizensTwo related questions emerge from these forecasts The first is whether the rise in commodity prices today will feed through into lofty inflation in the longer run There is in fact reason for cautious optimism A large body of research shows that the pass-through from higher oil prices into non-energy inflation is quite limited For instance Goldman Sachs a bank calculates that a 10% increase in crude-oil prices leads to a jump of nearly three-tenths of a percentage point in headline inflation in America but to an increase of just about three-hundredths of a percentage point in core inflation stripping out food and energy prices That helps explain why market expectations of longer-term price trends remain more subdued: pricing for inflation five years from now is close to the Fed goal of keeping inflation to an average of 2%The follow-up is what central bankers choose to do about rising commodity prices The received wisdom of the past few decades is that policymakers should avoid over-tightening in the face of oil shocks Indeed surging energy prices can act as a drag on consumption which is a particular concern for EuropeBut with real interest rates deeply negative in both America and Europe central banks still have a long way to go to rein in inflation whatever happens to commodity prices On March 10th the European Central Bank surprised markets by announcing that it would wind down its bond-buying more quickly And according to the Fed projections its quarter-point rate increase is likely to be the first of seven this year Central banks are for now sticking to their pre-war plans For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more of our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis

shipping it to Asia takes 45 Redirecting flows would get even harder if “secondary” sanctions target non-Western firms With Western payment systems out of bounds traders would turn to clunky bartering Better alternatives used by China or others could take years to scale upThis suggests a fair chunk of Russia oil supply could exit the market Other commodities would probably be affected Russia has pledged to respond to a full-blown oil embargo by curtailing gas exports to the West Limits on coal sales would also be painful and would complicate Europe effort to shift away from gas As the quality of its own supply has deteriorated the share of the bloc imports of coal coming from Russia has doubled over the past ten years to 80% In the case of both gas and coal much of Russia's supply would simply not get to market Its gas-storage facilities are almost full It does not have a big enough fleet to ship coal to Asia where it is most in demand it sends coal to Europe by railCall the cartelThe big question is whether an increase in supply from elsewhere could mitigate such losses Start with oil America has already scheduled an increase in oil output of 1m bpd The West could also press members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC to increase supply yielding perhaps another 2m bpd Lifting sanctions on Iran may add another 1m bpd Tapping emergency stocks would help too Last week America and other big oil-consuming countries agreed to release 60m barrels from their stash Hints have been given that they could release moreAll this may increase global supply by 3m-4m bpda lot but perhaps not enough And the extra supply would take too long to arrive OPEC members cannot crank up production fast because they have not invested in new fields for years Restarting American shale wells takes six months;

 Mar 12th 2022,Russia looks to Chinese financial plumbing to keep money flowing,NATIONALIST BLOGGERS in China have a new fascination: global payment systems Vladimir Putin attack on Ukraine followed by Western sanctions on Russia have prompted internet pundits to extol the virtues of the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System CIPS the rails on which Chinese banks transfer and clear yuan-denominated payments around the world Some have also taken to bashing SWIFT the Belgium-based financial messaging system that has started excluding Russian banks from international paymentsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCIPS and SWIFT are far from being household names in China But the sweeping sanctions against Russiaon the use of SWIFT by some of its banks and on its central bankhave shone a spotlight on China homegrown financial networks and the extent to which it can use them to help Russia Three primary Chinese financial channels are in place to assisttwo legitimate one not None is a remotely adequate substitute for the links to the Western financial system that Russia has lostFirst consider the direct connections between the two countries’ central banks which do not require SWIFT messaging to make transactions Russia has about $90bn-worth of mainly yuan-denominated deposits held with the Chinese central bank It also has a 150bn-yuan swap-line agreement with China It can use these funds to finance imports from China in the event that other trade-finance routes in dollars are blocked note analysts at Natixis an investment bankBut this trade will largely remain in yuan limiting what Russia can purchase China regulators are still keen to avoid American “secondary” sanctions Primary sanctions target Russian institutions and American firms that deal with them The secondary sort have yet to be used but would target third parties outside America that interact with Russian firms even if those transactions are permitted by local law Allowing Russia to sell yuan-denominated assets in order to raise dollars could attract scrutiny and go beyond what Chinese officials are willing to do for their friends in MoscowNext there are the several complex and widespread financial networks China has spent decades building Take for example the web of state-owned banks that have cropped up in commercial hubs around the world China banking regulator may have stated on March 2nd that the country would not join Western sanctions but most of its big banks will adhere to them particularly those that interact most with the Western financial system and have legal entities that are domiciled in America These large institutions which conduct the bulk of trade finance between the two countries are unlikely to risk getting blocked from dollar clearing in order to continue doing dollar-denominated business with Russia Maintaining full access to global financial markets is “more valuable than anything Russia can offer” according to Neil Shearing of Capital Economics a consultancyUnionPay China state-owned bank-card firm is another powerful financial network It is set to gain market share in Russia in the wake of the departures of Visa and Mastercard which were announced on March 5th Several Russian banks have announced that they will move to UnionPay which already has a significant presence in the countryThis shift will not come easily however Within Russia UnionPay network is small; many banks have no existing relationship with the company For Russians abroad the problem is that despite being in more than 180 countries UnionPay is a fringe service in America and Europe according to Jason Ekberg of Oliver Wyman a consultancyCIPS meanwhile will not be the miracle solution Chinese bloggers hoped for In order to protect its capital account China allows foreign banks to link to CIPS only indirectly through Chinese clearing banks and using SWIFT messaging notes Edwin Lai of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology That means Western sanctions may still apply to any transfers between SWIFT-barred Russian banks and foreign banksA final route for financial assistance will come through backchannel banks that dodge sanctions China has a long history of turning a blind eye to smaller banks that finance trade with countries targeted by America and the UN These activities usually occur on a small scale And many are caught in the act and hit with sanctions themselves In 2012 Bank of Kunlun was targeted by America for doing business with an Iranian bank Some small Chinese banks may take the risk with Russia but they will be unable to provide the large-scale assistance it needsAll told Sino-Russian financial links appear weaker than Russia might hope The situation is likely to raise questions about the shortcomings in China efforts to build global financial networks For CIPS many of the problems are clear In order to maintain control over capital flows China has not linked the system directly with banks outside mainland China with the exception of Standard Chartered a British bank with long-established links to China CIPS indigenous messaging system works only with Chinese banks To improve it China must continue opening it up and granting more direct links with foreign banks The lack of such links is reflected in the system transaction volumes It processes just 13000 per day around one-twentieth of the number handled by America domestic-payments system known as CHIPSChina President Xi Jinping has referred to Mr Putin as a “best friend” The Russian conflict is laying bare some of China financial vulnerabilities That may make the relationship less amicable For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 12th 2022,Western credit markets are holding up remarkably well,CREDIT IS THE financial system oxygen supply When it flows freely it does so unnoticed When it stops soon enough everything else does as well The hypoxic episode that felled the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 unleashed chaos turning a subprime-mortgage crunch into a global financial crisis Ever since central banks and market pundits have fixed a hawk-like gaze on credit conditions wary of a repeatListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday scramble for safe assets was prompted not by a financial crash but by Vladimir Putin invasion of Ukraine Nevertheless there are similarities Once again the dollar is ascendant as investors flee riskier currencies Hedging costs particularly for the war-adjacent euro are spiking as volatility rises and traders bet that a protracted conflict will continue to favour the greenback A rush into American government debtthe safest asset of allhas pushed Treasury yields down even as inflation expectations have risen Prizing security over returns lenders have driven corporate-bond spreads upThis flight to safety causes plenty of problems on its own A stronger dollar for instance increases the debt burden on countries that borrow in it and dents profits for American companies that earn a lot of their revenues abroad But the greatest threat to financial stability comes from the pressure it exerts on the money market where firms borrow to meet their short-term funding needs This market seizing up is the financial equivalent of a pulmonary embolism quickly forcing otherwise healthy firms up against the wall A dash for dollars is fine if it merely pushes exchange rates up The real trouble comes when it also creates a shortage of themThat happened in 2008 as banks became unwilling to lend to each other and the cost of borrowing for a few months jumped whole percentage points above the overnight rate Events were repeated in a much milder fashion in March 2020 as the world went into covid-induced lockdown On every measure of money-market stress from short-term commercial borrowing costs to the demand for dollars relative to other currencies the impact of Mr Putin war has been milder still see chartThere are two main reasons for this The first is that it follows a flood of liquidity from central banks Since March 2020 the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have issued $91trn 11% of global GDP in new reserves After that deluge notes Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics a consultancy it is almost surprising that there are strains on funding at allThe deeper reason is that money markets are now fitted with a comprehensive ventilation system Permanent swap lines between the Fed and five other big central banks allow them to exchange their own currency for dollars that can be distributed to domestic firms in times of stress A second facility allows a bigger group to simply borrow dollars from the FedMeanwhile banks no longer rely on unsecured loans from each other to plug day-to-day cash shortfalls For funding in dollars the replacement is the repo market where financial institutions and large companies borrow some $25trn from each other every day using Treasuries as security The high-quality collateral makes this market less susceptible to runs making banks and their clients less vulnerable to crises And it is backstopped by the Fed which has acted as lender of last resort since a series of liquidity wobbles in 2019Longer-term credit conditions are also weathering the storm remarkably well Spreads on risky high-yield “junk” bonds have been rising since the beginning of the year but having started at near-historic lows are nowhere near the levels they reached in March 2020For Lotfi Karoui of Goldman Sachs a bank that is unsurprising Around a fifth of the $16trn American high-yield bond market is issued by oil metals and mining firms that are benefiting from rather than being hurt by ballooning commodity prices More generally issuers tend to be sitting on high levels of cash and are using spare revenues to pay down debt keeping their bondholders happy Europe smaller €450bn $496bn high-yield market being geographically closer to the war has been hit correspondingly harder But even there investors are yet to take serious lossesA fortnight into a conflict that could end up being measured in years any claim that credit conditions will remain benign indefinitely would be foolish Mr Karoui points out that central bankers were bound to guard against a money-market shock as that was what led to disaster during the crisis of 2007-09 More dangerous are the risks monetary guardians have less experience with: who can tell for instance if a prolonged war will lead to another much broader gumming-up of global supply chains? Yet for now at least the West financial system is proving vastly more resilient than that of Fortress Russia For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 12th 2022,Our crony-capitalism index offers a window into Russia billionaire wealth,ALTHOUGH BILLIONAIRES have been getting a bad rap for years the sanctions levied at Russian oligarchs have

oligarchs”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe murky money sloshing around the favoured plutocratic playgrounds of New York London and Paris is nothing new In 2014 The Economist devised a crony-capitalism index to measure whether the world was experiencing a new gilded age characterised by the modern equivalent of the robber barons in late-19th-century America In 2016 when we last visited our index we found that crony-capitalists had thrived during the 2000s but were beginning to feel the heat from trustbusters in the rich world and anti-corruption purges in developing countries How has crony capitalism performed since?Rent-seeking entrepreneurs tend to use their relationships with the state to maximise profits Technically speaking an economic rent is the surplus remaining once capital and labour have been paid a market price With perfect competition that surplus would not exist But rents can be artificially elevated if firms win contracts at beneficial prices form cartels to stitch up consumers or lobby governments for favourable rules Most rent-seeking businesses are operating perfectly legallyOur index uses 25 years of data from Forbes annual stock-take of the world billionaires In 2021 the publication listed 2755 individuals with total estimated wealth of $13trn We have classified the main source of each billionaire wealth into crony and non-crony sectors Our crony sectors include a host of industries that are vulnerable to rent-seeking because of their proximity to the state such as banking casinos defence extractive industries and construction We have aggregated the data according to billionaires’ country of citizenship expressed as a share of its GDPRussia crony economy sticks out like a blinged-up Muscovite in the Algarve Some 70% of the 120 Russian billionaires who together hold 80% of its billionaire wealth fall within our crony-capitalist definition Wealth equivalent to 28% of Russia GDP in 2021 came from crony sectors up from 18% in 2016 But many Russian oligarchs will be taking haircuts on their empires as sanctions biteGlobally crony wealth has declined as a share of the total reflecting in part the surge in tech-related wealth Nonetheless it remains entrenched in many places In Malaysia a former prime minister was jailed for corruption in 2020 after $45bn was stolen from the state but crony capitalism still dominates there India share of billionaire wealth derived from crony sectors has risen from 29% to 43% in six years The Philippines has fallen to fourth in our index but crony sectors still account for four-fifths of total billionaire wealthBy contrast around four-fifths of American billionaires accounting for 90% of total wealth operate in non-crony sectors Led by a boom in tech valuations wealth in non-crony sectors rose from 11% to 17% of GDP between 2016 and 2021 But in recent years America has opened investigations into the firms of its behemoth-building billionaires Tech firms do exhibit some of the cosseted characteristics of crony industries: they spend heavily on lobbying to defend their juicy market shares for instance Reclassifying technology firms as crony would increase America crony wealth from 2% to 7% of GDPOver the past decade China has minted new billionaires faster than you can say Yves Saint Laurent In 2010 there were 89 Now there are 714 with a combined wealth of $3trn around 70% of the amount in America The crony-sector share of GDP has changed little in six years though its share of overall billionaire wealth has fallen from 44% to 24% This exposes one of the shortcomings of our index: to some extent all businesses operate in China with the consent of the state Falling out of favour can have grave consequences as Alibaba Jack Ma discovered in 2020 Assuming all Chinese billionaires are cronyistic would place China second in our indexBillionaires in autocratic countries remain vulnerable to the whims of their leaders Mikhail Khodorkovsky was worth $15bn in 2004 but he fell out with Vladimir Putin and his oil firm was expropriated A purge in Saudi Arabia has meant not a single billionaire from the kingdom has appeared on Forbes list since 2017 Billionaires in autocratic countries outside China derive about 70% of their wealth from crony sectors A good chunk of this $750bn is likely to be stashed in Western countries that do not ask too many

 Mar 12th 2022,How oil shocks have become less shocking,THE OMENS are bad for the world economy When oil prices surge growth typically moves in the opposite direction Sometimes the price shock begins with a political earthquake like the Suez crisis of 1956 Sometimes oil producers deliberately create the shock as with the OPEC embargo of 1973 And sometimes the culprit is soaring demand such as when oil prices hit record highs in 2008 The common denominator in all these cases is that America and most other rich countries soon enough faced recessionsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSo it would hardly be surprising if the current surge in oil pricesa doubling in three months fuelled by Russia invasion of Ukraineforeshadows a sharp downturn in growth Pictet an asset manager counts six episodes since 1970 in which real oil prices rose by more than 50% from their previous trend; each preceded a recession As of late February oil prices had already surpassed this 50% threshold and have only climbed higher since thenNevertheless the easily observed relationship between oil and the economy is no iron law There have been times when crude prices soared and yet recessions were averted including the peak of a global commodities boom in 2011 The type of shock matters as does the economic backdrop Moreover much of the world appears to have become better insulated from oil markets over time Old dismal patterns may not perfectly repeat themselvesConsider the mechanics by which rising oil prices hurt growth Energy is an important factor of production so a sharp decrease in its supply or increase in its price may drag down output It may also hurt demand: if people spend more of their incomes on oil less is left over for other things Add to this the possibility that central banks may tighten monetary policy aggressively when higher oil prices push up inflation as the Federal Reserve did following the OPEC crisis of 1973 and the Iranian revolution of 1979Yet no two oil shocks are the same A critical variable is whether the shock stems from the economy supply side or demand side If there is a sudden shortfall in supply as during an embargo that functions as a new tax on production and consumption If however robust demand is the cause rising oil prices reflect economic vitality Lutz Kilian an economist with the Fed branch in Dallas has shown that broad demand strength can for a time outweigh the negative effects of higher oil prices A pure supply shock is by contrast more harmful The period since the pandemic struck has featured a bit of both The quadrupling in crude prices from the spring of 2020 to the start of 2022 reflected growth roaring back from its pandemic-induced slowdown Only the most recent surge is unquestionably a supply shock caused by the Ukraine war and associated sanctionsThree changes in the structure of the global economy may dampen the effects of the price surge Most obviously oil role in growth cycles is not what it used to be In 1973 the world used nearly one barrel of oil to produce $1000-worth of GDP in inflation-adjusted terms By 2019 that was down to 043 barrels with the energy intensity of growth falling annually “in an almost perfectly linear fashion” according to a report last year by the Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University A shift in economic output from industry to services is part of the explanation The world has also become more efficient in using oil Cars for instance go twice as far per gallon of petrol as in the 1970sA related change is the way that governments respond to oil shocks As James Hamilton of the University of California San Diego has observed in the 1970s American officials aggravated economic dislocations with price controls on petrol which resulted in shortages Since 1981 they have steered clear of such controls which has made for more volatile crude prices but smoother market adjustments Some tweaks in behaviour have got easier thanks to the pandemic: if air fares soar why fly to that business meeting when you can log on to Zoom instead?Central bankers may also be less tempted to jack up interest rates simply because of soaring energy prices thereby reducing the risks of a recession There is a debate over whether the pass-through from oil shocks to core inflation is basically nil as argued in a paper for the Fed by Todd Clark and Stephen Terry or small as argued in another Fed paper by Cristina Conflitti and Matteo Luciani However the experts agree that the pass-through has weakened in part because of the diminished energy intensity of growth Even before the war in Ukraine the Fed was set to raise interest rates several times this year in order to rein in inflation The salient point is that according to market pricing investors do not believe that the oil shock will lead to much more aggressive moves by the Fed than previously expectedShale fellow well metA final difference with past oil shocks is the momentous evolution of America status in the global crude industry In the first decade of the 2000s America imported more than 10m barrels of oil per day in net terms With the shale revolution American oil production has soared such that it now meets most of its energy needs from its domestic production In 2020 America became a net exporter for the first time since at least 1949One effect is that oil shocks are now less destabilising for the American economy in aggregate Consumers may dislike rising crude prices but oil producers enjoy them A key question in the months ahead will be the extent to which they expand drilling That would help offset the economic loss from softer consumer spending And for the rest of the world a resilient American economy would provide useful ballast amid all the turbulence The EU must worry not just about oil but also about a much more acute shortage of natural gas Should it join America and Britain in banning Russian imports the price of crude could go much higher still But at oil current

the number of people deemed food-insecure at 800m was at its highest for a decade Many more could soon join them Higher food prices will also stoke inflation adding to the price pressures generated by dearer energyThe fallout from the war will be felt in three ways: disruption to current grain shipments low or inaccessible future harvests in Ukraine and Russia and withered production in other parts of the world Start with shipments In normal times wheat and barley crops are harvested in the summer and exported in the autumn; by February most ships are gone But these are not normal times: with global stocks low big importers of Black Sea wheat chiefly in the Middle East and North Africa are anxious to secure more supplies They are not getting them Ukrainian ports are shut Some have been bombed Inland routes via the north of Ukraine and onwards through Poland are too great a diversion to be practical Vessels trying to pick up grain from Russia have been hit by missiles in the Black Sea Most cannot get insuranceAlternative sources are unaffordable Last week Egypt cancelled its second wheat tender in a row after receiving only three offersat a stomach-churning pricedown from 20 a fortnight before More concerning still exports of corn of which Ukraine accounts for nearly 13% of global exports usually take place through the spring until the early summer Much of it is normally shipped from the port of Odessa which is bracing for a Russian assaultFuture crops are an even bigger worry In Ukraine the war may result in lower yields and area planted Winter crops such as wheat and barley which are sown in October could be smaller because of a lack of fertiliser and pesticides Spring crops such as corn and sunflowers the planting of which would normally start imminently may not get sown at all Leonid Tsentilo whose farm in central Ukraine grows 7000 tonnes of wheat a year says local prices for diesel and plant-protection products have risen by 50% in two weeks Some of his workers have been shipped off to warIn Russia the risk is not curtailed production but blockaded exports Although food sales are not yet subject to sanctions Western banks are reluctant to lend to traders Fear of being fined by governments in the West or shamed by its press is keeping merchants at bay While Ukraine is “unreachable” Russia is “untouchable” says Michael Magdovitz of RabobankMost alarming will be the conflict impact on agriculture worldwide The region is a big supplier of critical fertiliser components including natural gas and potash Fertiliser prices had already doubled or tripled depending on the type even before the war owing to rising energy and transport costs and sanctions imposed in 2021 on Belarus which produces 18% of the world potash as it cracked down on dissidents As Russia which accounts for 20% of global output finds it harder to export its own potash prices are sure to rise further Since four-fifths of the world potash is traded internationally the impact of price spikes will be felt in every agricultural region in the world warns Humphrey Knight of CRU a consultancyAs a result of all this a much greater share of incomes will soon be spent on food see chart This will be felt most acutely in the Middle East Africa and parts of Asia where some 800m people depend heavily on Black Sea wheat That includes Turkey which supplies much of the southern Mediterranean with flour Egypt usually buys 70% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine The latter alone accounts for half of Lebanon wheat imports Many others can hardly do without Ukraine corn soyabeans and vegetable oilMeanwhile higher fertiliser and energy costs will crimp farmers’ margins everywhere Brazil a huge producer of meat and agricultural products imports 46% of its potash from either Russia or Belarus says Cristiano Veloso of Verde AgriTech a Brazilian startup Eventually some of the costs will be passed on to the consumerProtectionism may pour more fuel on the fire National restrictions on fertiliser exports increased last year and could accelerate Limits on food exports or panic-buying by importers could trigger a price spike of the kind that sparked riots in dozens of countries in 2007-08 On March 8th and 9th respectively Russia and Ukraine banned wheat exports Argentina Hungary Indonesia and Turkey have announced food-export restrictions in recent daysThere is no easy fix Some of the 160m tonnes of wheat used as animal feed every year could be diverted for human consumption but substitution may export inflation to other staples Increasing production in Europe and America and drawing on India vast strategic stockpile may yield 10-15m tonnesa substantial quantity but less than a third of Ukraine and Russia combined annual exports Some could come from farther afield but there are bottlenecks: efforts to export more of Australia bumper winter-wheat crop have clogged the supply chains between its farms and ports With corn governments may resort to appropriating some of the 148m tonnes used as bioethanol feed to help plug this year likely shortfall of 35m tonnes Fertiliser shortages are even harder to cover: new potash mines take 5-10 years to buildThe war in Ukraine is already a tragedy As it ravages the world breadbasket a calamity looms For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Mar 7th 2022,The West threat of a ban on Russian oil shakes markets,“WE ARE NOW talking to our European partners and allies to look in a co-ordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil” With that bombshell announcement on March 6th Antony Blinken America secretary of state set global oil markets ablaze In the hours that followed the price of West Texas Intermediate WTI the American benchmark crude shot up by more than 9% Brent crude soared to nearly $140 a barrel double the price on December 1st before dropping to $123 on March 7th There is now speculation that oil could touch $200 a barrel if the war in Ukraine gets uglierThat is the volatile backdrop to the oil industry most important gathering of the year Thousands of energy executives and other grandees including the bosses of Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and America energy secretary have come to Houston for CERAWeek an annual conference put on by S&P Global a financial-information firm This week programme encompasses long-term issues like climate change and the energy transition but recent events ensure that geopolitics will dominate the gabfestOil markets are on a knife edge for three reasons First worries are growing that supply may be inadequate to cover disruptions The balance between demand and supply was already tight last year Fossil-fuel consumption rebounded strongly from the covid-induced slump in 2021 The International Energy Agency IEA an official forecaster even expects global oil demand to return to pre-pandemic levels by year-end With covid in retreat for now Americans are getting their gas-guzzlers ready for the summer “driving season”That says Abhi Rajendran of Energy Intelligence an industry publisher means firms should be building inventories now but they are not The snag is that oil supply has remained constrained as the result of under-investment and covid-related factors The OPEC cartel has not been able to meet its own production quotas Mr Rajendran reckons the market was undersupplied by some 1m barrels per day bpd before the war in Ukraine That had pushed prices towards $100 a barrelThe second reason for prices surging in response to Mr Blinken statement is the fact that Russia with its 45m bpd of crude exports and additional 25m bpd of oil-product exports is the world second-biggest exporter of petroleum If all those exports were cut off as the result of an American-led energy embargo or through Vladimir Putin using export curbs as an economic weapon the world economy would be dealt a severe blowTo soften it the West has turned to buffer stocks The IEA announced on March 1st that its member countries will co-ordinate the release of some 60m barrels of oil from their strategic reserves The only times the IEA has previously done this were during the Iraq-Kuwait war in 1990 Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the Libyan civil war in 2011 But Damien Courvalin of Goldman Sachs a bank argues that this one-off release of strategic stocks is “dwarfed by the potential magnitude of Russia export disruptions” He reckons it would not offset the loss of Russian seaborne exports for longMoreover no other supplier nor any combination of them could produce sufficient incremental volumes of oil quickly enough to replace the loss of all Russian exports James West of Evercore an investment bank reckons that even mighty Saudi Arabia can manage at most an extra 1m bpd of production within a few months Total OPEC spare capacity is not much more than 2m bpd Oil output is growing in Canada Brazil and Guyana but even taken together their growth will be far less than 1m bpd this yearThat is why America energy diplomats are working overtime to find other sources of oil to make up for any Russian shortfall One territory they are exploring is their own shale country Top federal officials from several different cabinet ministries have landed at CERAWeek hoping to woo American oilmen into cranking out more black gold The petroleum lobby is not happy with the Biden administration which it sees as climate-obsessed and vindictive towards fossil fuels so these overtures are likely to prove awkward What is more American shale output is already set to expand by 1m bpd this year Serious supply-chain stresses one oilman complains that the price of sand a vital component in the shale process has tripled of late stand in the way of doubling thatwhich could not happen in less than a year in any caseOne development that would be helpful is a lifting of sanctions on Iran That could potentially increase exports by around half a million bpd within six months and double that within a year Last week it appeared as though a sanctions-easing deal between Iran America and other world powers was close However it was dealt a setback by sudden demands by Russia for guarantees from America that any sanctions over Ukraine would not affect Russian trade with Iran American negotiators are also reportedly negotiating now with Venezuela another country with oil exports restricted by sanctions but Mr Courvalin reckons this could produce only about half a million bpd in extra exports within a yearThe emergence of “self-sanctions” is the third reason energy traders are worried Strikingly Russian petroleum exports have become toxic even before America has imposed any overt ban on them The sanctions imposed thus far on Russia have explicitly avoided targeting its energy sector but Fatih Birol head of the IEA notes that this has not prevented them from curtailing its petroleum exports “There is confusion in many parts of the world about whether buying Russian oil is affected by sanctions or not” he says As a result many counterparties are steering clear of anything RussianThat has sent Russian oil exports into a dive David Fyfe of Argus an energy publisher reckons that some 2m bpd of Russian petroleum is “already off the market one way or another” Western oil majors have come under intense pressure to limit their use of Russian crude and refined products Even firms in China and India normally relaxed about circumventing American sanctions are avoiding doing business with Russian-owned operated or flagged vessels or Russian ports When news surfaced that Shell stood to make a $20m profit trading a discounted cargo of Russian crude after piously withdrawing from several joint ventures in the country the firm suffered a backlash prompting it to announce it would place any profits from Russian oil into a Ukraine aid fundA slippery predicamentThe prospect of a Russian oil embargo poses a dilemma for America On one hand Western leaders want to punish Russia for its aggression without putting troops on the ground in Ukraine and energy is the most powerful of the tools they have not yet used; Russia biggest remaining vulnerability is its massive energy exports On the other hand precisely because its exports are so big cutting them off all at once would risk destabilising the world economy The IMF warned on March 5th that the consequences of the war and the economic sanctions are already “very serious” and if things escalate could become “more devastating”That is why Mr Blinken went on in his statement on March 6th to say that America would only impose a ban on Russian exports with allies or if necessary on its own if it can ensure that “there still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets” Allies’ reluctance to join in may be understandable given that America imports little Russian oil whereas Europe is Russia biggest customer: it imports 27m bpd of crude and 1m bpd of oil feedstocks and products from Russia according to Richard Joswick of S&P Global Commodity InsightsIs Mr Blinken serious? A “shock and awe” ban risks pushing America and Europe into recession That may tempt them into another less dramatic option They could finesse things with graduated sanctions as America did with Iran Imposing energy sanctions that ratchet down Russia permitted exports every few months would give it an incentive to curb its bad behaviour But the creative ambiguity and clumsiness involved in any attempt to finesse an embargo might lead to an oil shock all the same
 Mar 5th 2022,China scrambles to prevent property pandemonium,NOT LONG ago prospective homebuyers in China would find large maps on the walls of property marketing offices On display were not only the housing projects for sale The maps also showed the parcels of government land surrounding the projects and their expected future prices which were often higher than the home units for sale per square metre The implication for the anxious buyer-to-be was clear: buy now or regret it forever Very soon land prices would be far higher next doorListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe maps tell the story of China decades-long build-up in property debts These seemingly endless increases in prices were made possible only because developers had access to almost unlimited credit Ample loans offshore-dollar bonds and deposits from buyers once fuelled bidding wars between them that pumped up land values The winner was sure to turn a huge profit if they held onto the parcel and waited for the price to rise Local governments too happily gorged; land sales contributed 43% of their revenues in 2021Homebuyers are seeing a very different picture now Xi Jinping China president has been fearful of runaway unaffordability and untenable debt He has turned off the tap of easy credit by capping developers’ ratios of liabilities to assets net debt to equity and cash to short-term debt known as the “three red lines” This has pushed China property sector to the edge A dozen developers including Evergrande one of the world most indebted property groups have defaulted on bonds since July 2021 or have come close Companies recently deemed safe bets for investors have suddenly started looking wobbly One of those Shimao missed trust payments on February 24th Zhenro Properties stunned creditors on February 21st when it said it may not repay creditors in early MarchThe implications go far beyond the offshore bond market Construction has stalled in places Some developers are now selling assets to patch up their cash flows Many have stopped buying land causing the value of parcels sold by local governments to crater by 72% in January year on year Home prices are falling in many cities turning off speculators looking for the guaranteed huge gains once advertised on sales-office maps Families looking for flats wonder if they can even be builtWhether the central government holds firmly to its red lines is unclear If it does the property market will be forced to make a monumental adjustment to better match supply with real household demand for homes The annual supply of homes is now three times that of future urban-household formation reckons Rhodium a consultancy Sales must fall from around 15m units per year to about 10mAs the bubble deflates the effects are rippling through the Chinese economy Senior leaders have yet to issue an economic growth target for 2022 but many economists expect them to draw a line at 5% China GDP grew by nearly 6% in 2019 This will be a difficult rate to defend should the property sector which makes up an estimated 25% of GDP continue to crumble A major slowdown in turn would hamper a global economy already hobbled by soaring inflation and geopolitical clashesPolicymakers in Beijing must fulfil three major tasks if they are to avoid catastrophe First they must make sure offshore defaults do not spiral out of control closing out Chinese issuers from the dollar bond market A second task is to ensure firms continue to build homes and families continue to buy them This is crucial for economic growth this year A third daunting challenge is to formulate a long-term plan that brings some stability to the market over the next decadeMr Xi probably did not anticipate such a rapid rise in offshore defaults Altogether some $100bn in debts needs to be repaid this year Evergrande the group with $300bn in liabilities has been the biggest worry It defaulted in December and has become one of the largest restructuring cases in history Investors are tracking the case for reasons to be optimistic The group is now thought to be under a high degree of government control It has promised to deliver a restructuring plan by July State involvement is good because it will help avoid a total collapse says one person involved in the restructuring It also means that stability will be the main priority not speed or efficiencyResources are running low Legal expertise on such cross-border situations involving China is limited and so far many Chinese defaulters have been unwilling to cough up for high-quality advice Accounting firms have abruptly resigned from auditing developers’ books The early restructuring plans for a few Chinese developers have made little room for offshore creditors says a lawyer working on a case Evergrande offshore bonds currently trade at 15 cents on the dollara gloomy signal on what investors expect to get back High-yield dollar bond issuance by Chinese companiesan important source of credit for themhas fallen substantiallyA second task for the Communist Party will be to keep developers building and buyers buying Sales for the 100 biggest firms came down by close to half in February compared to the same month last year Investment in property fell by 14% in December Prices in many cities have declined Domestic sales of excavators nearly halved in January year on yearPolicymakers are fidgety Like global hedge funds they want to avoid ugly incidents at companies such as Zhenro The sudden shocks arise because developers have not been giving a clear picture of their total cash positions They include billions of yuan held tightly in escrow accounts by local governments who want to ensure the money is used to build homes not pay creditors When payments come due the companies cannot access all the cash they say they have Fitch a rating agency downgraded Ronshine another large developer on February 22nd on concerns that it would fail to access such fundsTrapped cash is also halting some construction Many workers have laid down their shovels after going unpaid Evergrande has claimed it can build 600000 homes this yearmusic to officials’ ears Yet on February 16th a court in mainland China froze 640m yuan $101m of the company cash after it could not pay a state-owned construction groupThe central government plans to standardise escrow accounts so that less of the developers’ cash is locked into them But that will not be enough to rescue the sector Investors hope that Beijing blinks and reverses some of its tough policies Some local governments have already flinched The city of Zhengzhou in central China on March 1st said it would make it easier for people to buy second homes In the south the city of Guangzhou cut mortgage-loan rates by 20 basis points on February 22nd Banks in Shanghai have made similar cutsIf more cities follow developers may avoid facing up to the reality that household demand is lower than they wantat least for a bit longer Analysts still have big questions on developers’ true levels of cash and debt Many are thought to have huge off-balance-sheet debts that have gone unreported says Luther Chai of CreditSights a research firm Eight large developers with offshore bonds currently have far less unrestricted cash than short-term debts Evergrande has just 40% of the cash it would need to pay its known short-term debts Another large developer Golden Wheel Tiandi has just 20%Mr Xi loves to say that the Chinese people face “three great mountains” between them and their prosperity Those are education health care and housing The first two are already dominated by the state Housing is still largely controlled by tycoons From the government perspective it would make sense if much more of the property sector eventually became state-run says Robin Xing of Morgan StanleyThis appears to be part of the long-term planthe Communist Party third work in progress The state is already getting involved in two ways The first is through state-owned asset-management companies AMCs that buy up bad debt on command One of those Cinda is already working with Evergrande But others are said to be quietly absorbing bad debts from developers in effect acting as a buffer for the banking system This has ruled out the need for a major state bail-out because the AMCs are drip-feeding support to many companies says a credit investorThe state is also set to take a more direct long-term role in the property market through buying up subsidiaries of private developers Evergrande said on February 25th that it would sell four projects to state-owned companies In late January Sunac once an aggressive private acquirer of property assets sold a 40% stake in a local subsidiary to state-run Huafa Group Regulators are encouraging the trend by asking banks to loosen up on lending for mergers and acquisitions State banks plan to issue about $4bn in bonds to fund property mergers according to Caixin a financial magazine State developers are also buying up swathes of land to help shore up local government finances Given state firms’ reputation for inefficiency the potential for waste is hugeTax could also become a bigger part of future housing policy In theory a housing tax would serve two purposes: discouraging speculation and generating local revenues But experts have noted that those targets conflict A tax that discourages investment will also limit governments’ income A tax pilot in Shanghai is set as low as 04% of the latest sales price This has neither deterred investors nor generated much revenue for local officials There is no neat solution for delinking local revenues from land sales Few local officials want to make a shift away from easy land sales and receive a “sucker payoff” in return says Adam Liu of the National University of SingaporeMore extreme fixes are being floated In January Evergrande former chief economist Ren Zeping said China should bankroll 50m births over the next decade by printing 2trn yuan in new cash for family handouts effectively creating millions of future homebuyers The controversial idea got him blocked from posting on Weibo a Twitter-like platform But it also highlighted the desperate nature of China demographic shortfallsIf policymakers stick to their guns on limiting developer leverage the property market must hew to real demand from families in the coming decade That will mean a much smaller market New housing starts peaked in 2019 at around 18bn square metres doubling from 2008 In a highly optimistic scenario in which 65% of China roughly 170m people currently aged 16-25 eventually live in cities and 90% of those enter the housing market that still only creates demand for about 50m homes over the next decade estimate Allen Feng and Logan Wright at RhodiumEven if each of those new households bought two homes the current rate of building would fulfil that demand in just five and a half years “Supply needs to adjust”

 Mar 5th 2022,War and sanctions means higher inflation,RUSSIA MAY have tried to build a “fortress economy” but it is the West that currently looks financially impervious Compared with the deep economic crisis brought about in the country by Western sanctions the consequences for the rich world have been small Though American stocks fell sharply when the war started on February 24th on March 2nd they closed almost 4% higher than their level the night before the invasion European stocks are about 4% downa big hit but nothing compared with the financial rout under way in Russia where the currency has collapsed and stockmarket trading has been suspended for daysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn part the muted reaction reflects Russia low weight in the global economy: about 2% in dollar terms The country relative poverty and smaller population when compared with the rest of Europe mean that its exporters depend on European demand but not vice versa Goldman Sachs a bank estimates that the loss of exports caused by a 10% fall in Russian spending would cost the euro zone only about 01% of its GDP and Britain still less Financial links are modestYet Russia economic importance vastly outweighs its GDP or financial clout owing to its energy exports It produces nearly a fifth of the world natural gas and more than a tenth of the world oil the price of which drives much of the short-term variation in global inflation Typically 30-40% of the EU gas supply comes from Russia though this has fallen to about 20% in recent months as Europe has increased its imports of LNG from America It does not just heat Europe homes but also powers much of its industrial production Among big economies Italy and Germany are particularly exposedEnergy prices increased dramatically on March 1st and 2nd European natural-gas spot prices are now more than double their level at the start of February So are futures prices for delivery in December 2022 reflecting in part the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany which had been hoped to ease supply this year The oil price is up over 25% to about $115 per barrel The energy squeeze will worsen Europe inflation problem while also hitting its growth JPMorgan Chase a bank has raised its forecast for euro-area inflation at the end of the year by 11 percentage points to 36% while cutting its growth forecast for 2022 by 06 percentage points to 41% As a producer of oil and gas America is mostly insulated from the drag on growth but will feel the inflationary effects of pricier oilThings could get much worse should sanctions expand in scope to cover energy purchases or if Russia retaliates against them by reducing its exports JPMorgan Chase projects that a sustained shut-off of the Russian oil supply might cause prices to rise to $150 per barrel a level sufficient to knock 16% off global GDP while raising consumer prices by another 2% The stagflationary shock would carry echoes of the Yom Kippur war of 1973 which sparked the first of the two energy crises of that decade It greatly worsened an existing inflation problem caused in part by the collapse earlier that year of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates Today much pricier energy would be layered atop the inflation caused by the pandemic and the associated stimulusIf the oil and gas keep flowing the existing increases in their respective prices will still make life uncomfortable for central banks who were anyway raising or preparing to raise interest rates They usually tolerate inflation caused by expensive energy It tends to quickly dissipate or even go into reverse But recently they have worried that the persistence of high inflation since last summer might lead companies to think they should continue to increase prices at a rapid pace and workers to continue to ask for higher wages Inflation in other words may have taken on a momentum of its own Further increases in energy prices can only heighten that dangerwhile adding to the squeeze on growth that higher interest rates bring aboutAt present markets are priced for a fairly conventional policy response Since February 1st investors’ inflation expectations as revealed by the price of swaps have risen sharply at a one-year horizon for Britain America and the euro zone Yet expectations for longer-term inflation as measured by long-dated forward swaps have not changed much see chart Projections of the ECB policy rate at the end of the year have barely changed Investors have priced in another quarter-of-a-percentage-point rise in interest rates this year in both Britain and America On March 2nd Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal reserve indicated that it would still raise ratesThere have however been sharp movements in bond yields at longer horizons In mid-February yields on five-year German government bonds had been in positive territory for the first time since 2018 They have since fallen to about -025% On March 1st and 2nd the yield on an American ten-year Treasury bond fell from nearly 2% to 17% a greater fall than in any two-day trading period since March 2020 before recovering slightly to 19% the next dayIn other words investors are betting that today inflation even once exacerbated by the war in Ukraine will be temporaryand that over the long term interest rates are likely to be a bit lower than on past projections But that hardly means markets are sanguine In recent years some scholars have argued that low long-term real interest rates reflect in part the impulse to hoard safe assets as tail risksrare but highly costly eventsgrow more likely After two years of a pandemic and with war raging in Europe that thesis has never seemed so apposite For more expert analysis of the biggest stories

 Mar 5th 2022,The war in Europe is a triple whammy for emerging markets,EVEN BEFORE Russia invaded Ukraine emerging markets were braced for a testing year The conflict threatens to lengthen a list of woes that already included inflation slowing growth public finances strained by rising interest rates and lingering disruptions from covid-19 In a worst-case scenario the fallout may even top all these concernsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as

economy is mid-weight and only loosely integrated with global supply chains It is not a major market for exports Steps taken by Western banks to reduce their exposure to Russia following its seizure of Crimea in 2014 also limit the risk of direct financial contagion Instead the fallout for the emerging world will come in three indirect waysThe first channel is that of global liquidity conditions which are tightening Though the war does not seem to pose a serious financial-stability threat at the moment markets have grown nervier If worry were to give way to panic the rush to obtain dollars could cause liquidity to dry up and markets to malfunctionrecalling the breakdowns seen in the early months of the pandemic Then it took huge interventions by America Federal Reserve and other central banks to prevent a global financial shock And even with that mighty support most emerging economies faced a rapid and painful adjustment as their currencies tumbled A few were pushed into defaultFor now such disasters seem a distant possibility The invasion has nonetheless prompted investors to flock to assets they deem the least risky Stockmarkets across the emerging world have slipped since mid-February Over the week following the beginning of the war yields on German bunds and American Treasuries traditional safe havens have been down by as much as 03 percentage points Slowly but

short-term unsecured loans and the overnight risk-free rate has risen But the uptick is dwarfed by the spike observed during the wild gyrations of early 2020 to say nothing of the market madness seen during the global financial crisisA flight to safety could raise the cost of borrowing across emerging markets and increase the burden of debt Prices for hard-currency bonds issued by governments and firms have fallen over the past week while the spread between the yield on emerging-market corporate bonds and that on Treasury bonds has jumped by about half a percentage point That too is a modest rise relative to what markets experienced in the spring of 2020 when the spread leapt by four percentage points in the space of a month But higher borrowing costs for governments and firms are less easily managed after two years of rising indebtedness And even in the absence of default dearer credit stands to crimp private investment and further limit governments’ fiscal room for manoeuvreAdverse moves on markets could exacerbate the challenges caused by new macroeconomic headwindsthe second channel of contagion In peacetime both Russia and Ukraine are big exporters of commodities including oil and gas precious and industrial metals and agricultural products Since mid-February prices for many of these have jumped Oil prices are up by more than 25% over the past fortnight The price of wheat has soared by more than 30% Some emerging-market exporters stand to benefit from rising proceeds For Gulf economies the surge in crude prices is an unexpected windfallYet even the biggest commodity exporters are likely to face difficulties when food and energy costs rise above already high levels squeezing household budgets and putting monetary policymakers in a bind Before the war a year-long campaign by Brazil central bank to rein in high inflationin which it raised its benchmark interest rate by nearly nine percentage pointsseemed to be bearing fruit Now food and energy price shocks it can do little about threaten to spoil its fragile achievement Turkey where year-on-year inflation surged to nearly 50% in January is in an even stickier spot On March 1st the Turkish defence minister urged Russia to accept an immediate ceasefire Large importers of wheat and sunflower oil across north Africa and the Middle East most notably Egypt may see the price of staples rocket fuelling popular discontentAs these developments unfold a third force will operate in the background Russian aggression and the West shock-and-awe financial and economic response represent another jolt to a global economy which over the past half-decade has weathered trade wars a pandemic supply-chain disruptions and an increasingly unpredictable policy environment As firms and investors watch the carnage in eastern Europe they may reassess how to price geopolitical risk in foreign markets That could inflate country-risk premiums applied to far-flung assets increasing the cost of funding for emerging markets and reducing investment volumesIn difficult times the saying goes global investors worry less about the return on capital than the return of it Should many of them decide to pack up and go home the war collateral damage will include that suffered by the emerging economies they leave behind For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics

 Mar 5th 2022,South Korea economy threatens to become like Japan,IN 1989 AT the peak of Japan economic and financial heyday few dared suggest the country might one day be supplanted as the richest large nation in Asia Per person South Korea was not even half as affluent But then mighty stock and land bubbles popped in Tokyo kick-starting several “lost” decades for the Land of the Rising Sun Meanwhile South Korea economy boomed By 2018 its GDP per person adjusted for purchasing power topped JapanListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSimilarities between the two economies extend beyond converging income levels Both built their wealth during periods of export-led growth Now South Korea working-age population is shrinking as Japan did after the mid-1990s Most uncanny are echoes between the financial risks which emerged in Japan in the late 1980s and those mounting in South Korea today They too could trap Asia mightiest tiger in the doldrums for decadesSuper-expensive houses have become a major issue in South Korea tight presidential election which takes place on March 9th The two front-runnersLee Jae-myung of the ruling Minjoo Party and Yoon Seok-youl of the centre-right People Power Partyhave clashed over housing policy throughout the campaignThe outgoing government repeated efforts to rein in the property market through tighter loan-to-value restrictions on mortgage-lending and steeper taxes on owners of multiple homes have had little effect Low interest rates and an ageing population seeking rental income as it nears retirement have proved stronger forces In the Seoul metropolitan area home to around half of South Korea 52m people property prices have almost doubled in the past ten yearsThere is no specific threshold beyond which the value of all land in a country relative to the size of its economy suggests asset prices are unsustainable But the ratio for South Korea is both high by international standards and relative to the country recent history It now runs at five times its GDP up from around four times in 2013 At the peak of Japan folly the value of all land rose to 54 times GDP before collapsing through the 1990sPricking South Korea apparent bubble would be less dangerous had liabilities not risen in tandem with asset values South Korean people and firms have been borrowing at a frantic pace In September last year the country household debt stood at 107% of its GDP compared with 58% in Germany and 79% in America Non-financial corporate debt runs to 114% above the average for advanced economiesThis too recalls 1980s Japanand not in a good way Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo warns of a possible “balance-sheet recession” During Japan boom years asset values and liabilities surged together When its land-and-stock bubble burst asset values crumbled but borrowers still had the same liabilities to repay That left them in a state of negative equity As firms and households all rushed to deleverage the economy shrunk “Individually they were doing the right thing Collectively they were destroying the economy” says Mr KooIn 2020 the IMF flagged that South Korea was only one accident away from a damaging balance-sheet recession Although lending to subprime borrowers was limited it noted that about half of South Korea household credit was either linked to floating interest rates or required large lump-sum repayments meaning it would need to be refinanced at potentially higher interest rates It also noted that the country many small- and mid-sized firms dependent on shorter-term bank loans backed by property collateral looked exposedHas the dreaded accident arrived? South Korea was one of the first major economies to raise interest rates during the pandemic and has now done so three times Most analysts expect the tightening to continue: the central bank has said it is concerned about both rising inflation and the financial-stability risk posed by soaring asset values Yet again that has an 1980s flavour: Japan troubles began when the central bank started raising rates rapidly to pop the country asset bubbleThe Bank of Korea policy of “leaning against the wind” as Jeong Woo Park of Nomura calls it is having snowballing effects that may be hard to stop As a result of stricter credit controls introduced to cool down property prices mortgage interest rates are accelerating faster than benchmark ones After surging through pre-pandemic levels they flirted with decade-highs in JanuaryThe parallel has limits Japan financial institutions were famously poorly regulated leaving policymakers constantly surprised by the level of damage done to the financial system as crises popped up repeatedly through the 1990s South Korea unusual Jeonse credit system through which households borrow to fund lump-sum rental payments makes it difficult to assess how risky household debt truly isBut the scary similarities will continue to grow as South Korean politicians central bankers and regulators endeavour to engineer a smooth end to the explosion in asset prices They have the Japanese experience to learn from But understanding the worst-case scenario may prove easier than avoiding it For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Mar 5th 2022,Vladimir Putin Fortress Russia is crumbling,FOLLOWING RUSSIA’S invasion of Ukraine an economic war has begun The West has imposed unprecedented sanctions Investors are dumping Russian assets as fast as they can So far this year the rouble has lost one-third of its value The government may soon default Capital Economics a consultancy expects Russian inflation to hit 15% before long with GDP falling by 5% this yearListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe ructions in Russia markets have taken many by surprise For years President Vladimir Putin had apparently successfully built up Russia economic defences such that it would easily be able to resist whatever Western governments threw at itwhat Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management dubbed the “Fortress Russia” strategy It turns out that the strategy has been a failure “From Fortress Russia to Rubble Russia in a week” says Mr AshFortress Russia was a product of Russia chaotic recent history Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 inflation exceeded 2000% In 1998 Russia defaulted causing the value of the rouble to fall by more than two-thirds Then in 2014 a collapse in oil prices plus international sanctions over Russia actions in Crimea and the Donbas sent the economy into a deep recessionAs Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy show in “Mr Putin: Operative in the Kremlin” a book published in 2015 the Russian president has long wished that his country could be self-reliant Since 2014 however that ideology has gone into overdrive with Mr Putin desperate to ensure that the West could never again exert economic control over his countryThe idea for Fortress Russia went something like this On the economic front Russia would diversify its economy away from oil and gas two volatile commodities It would lessen its dependence on Western technology and trade On the financial front it would reduce external debt It would practise tight fiscal and monetary policy allowing it to accumulate vast amounts of foreign exchange with which it would be able to defend the rouble or that it would channel to favoured companies at times of crisisThere have been some successes Take the economy first Russia is somewhat less dependent on hydrocarbons In 2019 oil profits accounted for about 9% of GDP down from around 15% when Mr Putin took office Oligarchs remain exceptionally powerful controlling a huge share of overall Russian wealth but their influence appears to have stopped growing Between 2000 and 2019 Russia services industry grew by seven percentage points of GDP even if productivity growth in most sectors has been pitifulIn some areas Russia has developed technologies which operate independently of Western ones Mir a Russian payments system accounted for a quarter of domestic card transactions in 2020 up from nothing five years ago The share of Russian imports classed as “high-tech” seems to be falling fast World Bank data suggest In the past decade European exports of whizzy products to Russia have stagnated while growing elsewhereBut the fortress walls have gaping holes Russia remains enmeshed in the supply chain of Western ideas and technologies According to our analysis of bilateral data on stocks of long-term investment control of companies say or the construction of new factories the Russian economy is somewhat more reliant on the West than it was a decade ago About 30% of Russian imports come from G7 countries hardly different from 2014 In some industries such as chipmaking and computers Russia remains wholly dependent on American parts The cards of some Russian banks under sanction no longer work with Apple Pay or Google Pay which on February 28th caused chaos on the Moscow metro as people could not get through the turnstilesThe chaos in Russia financial markets has been an even bigger surprise After all by 2022 Russia had $630bn-worth of international reserves around 40% of GDP the most ever and had diversified away from American dollars It had also greatly reduced its foreign-denominated debt owed to foreigners since 2014But the country remains dependent on foreign investors Their short-term asset holdings including bank loans and stocks relative to GDP are about as high in Russia as they are in other emerging marketsand they have remained steady since 2014 Even without sanctions Russian assets would be under huge pressure as investors run for the exitsAnd Russia always assumed that it would be able to access foreign exchange to defend the rouble It is not completely cut off: Russia energy exports have largely escaped Western bans so it still has some dollars flowing in But because of sanctions 65% of Russia reserves may in effect be worth $0 The other 35% held in gold and yuan cannot be used to defend the currency in the dollar and euro marketsRussia difficulties will only compound over time Being shut out of the SWIFT financial-transfer system will hurt trade; SPFS a Russian-backed rival remains far less popular Russia still needs dollars to pay for a third of its imports a problem when it has suddenly become harder to get hold of them Even in its imports from China where progress has been made on “de-dollarisation” around 60% of transactions still take place using the greenbackA test from GodThe question is whether Mr Putin really cares about all this He may not welcome the prospect of angry oligarchs should some of them indeed dare to raise their voice But according to Ms Hill and Mr Gaddy book a core tenet of Putinism is survivalism where one sees economic warfare as a test of strength The pain is the point “In this narrative Russia constantly battles for survival against a hostile outside world” they say “The one critical lesson from history is that Russia the state always survives in one form or another” Russia faces a deep recession But rather than relent Mr Putin may double down on his attempts to cut Russia off from the outside world Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:How to avoid a

 Feb 28th 2022,The rouble collapse compounds Russia isolation,ON MONDAY as financial markets began trading in Asia the value of the Russian rouble collapsed The cause was harsh Western sanctions introduced over the weekend In effect these freeze Russia foreign currency reserves and begin to lock Russian banks out of the SWIFT network for arranging international transactions The US dollar rose by as much as 40% against the rouble taking the Russian currency from its Friday closing level of around 84 to the dollar to as high as 118 a new recordThe move will be one of the largest one-day slumps in the Russian currency modern history similar in scale to the one-day declines recorded during the worst moments of the country financial crisis in 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt In mid-morning in Moscow the Russian central bank raised its key interest rate from 95% to 20% in an effort to stem the rouble slump and the country finance ministry ordered companies with foreign-currency revenues to convert 80% of their income into roublesThe rouble collapse shows how isolated the government has become Its functional exclusion from international financial markets could do the economy grave harm A plunging currency makes imports of everything from cars to medical products dramatically more expensive External debts much of which are denominated in dollars will be more difficult to service The rouble decline will further reduce the falling quality of life for the Russian middle class and it will harm any company that has to pay for overseas goods and servicesThe country central bank has ordered financial institutions to reject the instructions of foreign clients attempting to sell Russian securities a move that may be the beginning of controls to prevent massive outflows of capital Any ban on foreign investors from getting out their money could sour what little is left of the country reputation as an investment destination Over the weekend Russian citizens queued outside banks to withdraw their money Panic about the stability of Russia financial system could yet lead to bank runsOil prices climbed higher on worries about disruptions to supply possibly because of embargoes On Monday-morning trading in Asia they rose to just short of $100 per barrel up by around 5% compared with their levels at the end of last week As a huge exporter of oil and gas Russia would usually gain from higher energy prices But the plunge of the rouble suggests that the extra revenue from commodity sales is expected to pale in comparison to the damage done by sanctionsThe spillover in other markets was muted in early trading on Monday with benchmark equity indexes in Hong Kong Shanghai and Tokyo not far from their levels at the close on Friday American and European market indices were lower but not drastically so But as investors scramble to work through the knock-on effects of the conflict for assets around the world more frenetic trading activity may yet be to comeThe threat of more severe sanctions has become increasingly real since financial markets closed for the weekend on February 26th The announcement that America Britain and the European Union would target the Russian central bank and its ability to sell its $630bn in foreign-exchange reserves much of which are held in overseas custody could frustrate Russia ability to defend the value of its currency On Monday morning the EU prohibited all transactions with the Central Bank of RussiaRussian banks’ bid-and-ask quotes for US dollarsthe prices at which a dealer will buy or sellwidened dramatically during the weekend demonstrating both uncertainty about what lies ahead and also how keen holders of dollars are to hang onto hard currency Sberbank Russia largest bank quoted a spread of around 22% between purchases and sales of dollars even before Monday enormous move in the exchange rate One week ago the spread was just 5%The Russian government has made efforts in recent years to protect itself from the full impact of any further international sanctions In 2014 the central bank established an alternative financial messaging system to SWIFT called SPFS Last year it boasted that the system message volume exceeded 20% of SWIFT levels in 2020 with around 400 institutions connected to the system including several foreign companiesBut recent international sanctions mean that banks overseas will hesitate to participate in any workarounds that could violate incoming sanctions In 2020 when the American Treasury Department imposed sanctions on political and security figures in Hong Kong even Chinese banks in the territory would not hold accounts for those who had been targeted The reason is that they were fearful of losing access to dollar-denominated payment and settlementDirect exposure between the Russian financial system and the rest of the world is slim but not non-existent Banks based in Russia record $134bn in liabilities owed to institutions abroad according to data from the Bank for International Settlements around 04% of the global total Four-fifths of the country 155trn-rouble government bond market is held domestically That means there is less risk of direct financial contagion from a Russian financial crisisA handful of European banksHungary OTP Austria Raiffeisen France Société Générale and Italy UniCredithave meaningful exposure to Russia or Ukraine according to S&P global ratings a credit-rating agency But there is no obvious current equivalent to Long-Term Capital Management the American hedge fund which collapsed in 1998 as a result of highly leveraged bets on Russian government bonds threatening to take much of Wall Street with itInstead the most important effects of Russia financial distress could flow through real economic channels The rising price of oil will exacerbate inflation which has already surged in most of the Western world And Chicago wheat futures for delivery in May rose by around 7% during overnight trading to a little over $9 per bushel As a staple foodstuff across much of the world more supply disruptions will mean higher food prices too According to Rabobank a Dutch bank Russia and Ukraine account together for 30% of global wheat exports The reaction of the Federal Reserve to the market ructions adds another element of uncertainty Until the conflict erupted expectations that the Fed might signal its intention to whip inflation with a 05 percentage point interest-rate increase were growing Based on market pricing investors still expect the American central bank to raise rates at its mid-March meeting but by a more restrained 025 percentage pointsIf the weakness of the rouble endures and efforts to prevent capital from leaving the country continue the financial damage to Russian businesses and livelihoods could be lasting The diversification of Russia economy away from commodities would have been set back by years Just as Vladimir Putin Russia president has made himself a pariah by invading the country next door so the Russian economy could end up being isolated tooOur recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found

 Feb 27th 2022,How new sanctions could cripple Russia economy,EVER SINCE Russia seized Crimea in 2014 Western sanctions have failed to bite or act as a credible deterrent against Russian aggression The new measures targeting Russia financial system announced by America the EU and other allies on February 26th change that They have come too late to prevent an invasion of Ukraine but they are capable of triggering financial mayhem in Russia because they target its central bank and may lead to the freezing of its $630bn of foreign-exchange reserves This could trigger a run on Russia banks and currency and will cause shudders in global markets and a further spike in energy prices It may also trigger Russian retaliation On February 27th Russia said the sanctions were “illegitimate” and indicated that Russia nuclear forces had been put on a heightened level of alertness in response The West deployment of this economic weapon will also be watched with slack-jawed shock in China which has $34trn of reserves and which will now be rethinking how to resist Western pressure in the event of a war over TaiwanUp until now Western sanctions have been long on macho rhetoric about crushing Russia but short on clout For example the penalties on oligarchs and their offshore wealth have led some tycoons to call for an end to the bloodshed but not changed decision-making in the Kremlin Meanwhile limits on Western technology and industrial exports to Russia will take months or years to have an effect Even American sanctions announced on February 24th against Sberbank and VTB Bank which together hold 75% of the Russian banking industry assets were a serious but not killer blow particularly since energy transactions were exempted Russia “fortress” financial system looked capable of withstanding the economic weapons that the West dared to useThe salvo on February 26th goes much further Many of the headlines in America and Europe have dwelled on the decision to cut off some Russian banks probably Sberbank and VTB from SWIFT the global cross-border payments messaging system In fact the SWIFT decision is incremental rather than a game-changer It will make all counterparties not just Western ones wary of dealing with these firms If they choose to do so they will have to resort to using email and phone to communicate adding a layer of hassleInstead the really big step is to target the institution at the heart of Russia fortress economy the central bank It holds $630bn of foreign reserves equivalent to 38% of Russia GDP in 2021 the sanctions may also cover other government-run funds Officials in the Biden administration say that they acting with Europe will prevent the central bank from using these reserves to undermine the impact of sanctions As part of the fortress strategy Russia has shifted the composition of its reserves away from dollars: as of June 2021 it held only 16% in greenbacks versus 32% in euros 22% in gold and 13% in Chinese yuan However it is likely that the majority of its holdings of securities bank deposits and other instruments regardless of the currency they are denominated in are held in accounts with financial institutions or in jurisdictions that will enforce Western sanctions That means some or even much of Russia national war chest can be frozen Responding to the new measures the central bank said on February 27th that it had all necessary resources and instruments to maintain financial stability But the implications are daunting If the central bank does not have instant access to the reserves it will be hard for it to intervene in the currency market by using foreign cash to support the sagging rouble as it has done in the past few days The central bank may be unable to offer foreign-currency liquidity to banks that are under sanctions in turn increasing the probability that they may default on their foreign-currency obligations to counterparties And it will be unable to act as a middle-man for such banks making or receiving foreign payments with foreign counterparties on their behalf which is one theoretical way of evading sanctionsThat all points to an intensifying panic in Russia financial system So far the damage from the war has been severe but tolerable The currency has fallen by 10% year-to-date the stockmarket by 35% and the share prices of the biggest banks by over 50% As of February 25th the cost of insuring against a Russian government default was on a par with Turkey Now the pressure is likely to intensify Ordinary Russians may lose confidence in the banking system although providing their withdrawals are denominated in roubles the central bank can offset this by offering rouble loans to the banks Thanks to its oil earnings Russia runs a current-account surplus earning more from abroad than it buys from abroad But if there is panic and capital flight without access to its reserves it could be forced to introduce tight capital controls to prevent a currency collapse It may also choose to temporarily close the financial markets short-selling of shares has already been bannedSo far while there have been some signs of Chinese banks steering clear of dollar-denominated transactions with Russian firms there has been little sign that China or many other Asian countries intend to enforce Western sanctions But now with a higher risk of default on foreign-currency obligations by Russian banks firms and the government all of their counterparties not just Western ones will be more wary of them The new measures are sufficiently severe that they may be treated by Russia as something close to an act of war and lead to it retaliating On February 27th it said that it had put its nuclear forces on a “special regime of duty” which means a heightened level of alertness This is designed to signal that the Kremlin does not believe that there is a neat boundary between economic and conventional warfare The West may now have to alter its nuclear posture in response There are other ways for Russia to retaliate One path is intensifying cyber-attacks on Western institutions Another is for it to limit gas supplies to Europe Up until February 25th the supply of gas from Gazprom through Ukraine had been boosted back to normal levels according to Bloomberg But Russia could now taper down supply This would have only a moderate financial impact on Russia oil exports are far more important to its economy but would lead to higher energy prices and consumer bills in Europe In this scenario the West would still have other economic weapons with which to escalate including blocks on consumer internet services or sanctions on Russian oil Whether the West newfound resolve succeeds in inflicting a devastating blow on Russia economy before Russia inflicts a devastating military blow on Ukraine remains to be seen But the new measures will inflict heavy damage on Russia And they also represent a rubicon that will fundamentally alter how sanctions and the global economy work That is because plenty of other countries that pursue foreign policies that America does not agree with hold large sums of reserves The largest of all is China much of whose vast savings are held in Western financial instruments or through Western firms It will be watching and learning from Russia financial squeeze and how Russia retaliates and trying to assess how it can avoid becoming crushed by the West financial vice Our recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found hereFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories

 Feb 26th 2022,America tariff wall on Chinese imports looks increasingly like Swiss cheese,“AN EASY WAY to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA It very simple!” In the days when Twitter was the main medium for presidential proclamations that was what Donald Trump recommended to companies using China as a manufacturing base He was half right: avoiding tariffs has proved to be quite simple What he failed to see though was that avoidance is an eminently viable strategy for companies staying put in ChinaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe scale of avoidance is to use a non-technical term huge A giant discrepancy that has opened up between Chinese and American trade data provides a window onto the tariff-dodging that has occurred over the past three years since America slapped duties on Chinese products Much of it involves importers taking advantage of legal loopholes; some of it appears to be outright evasion with companies lying to customs inspectorsThe numbers add up quickly: the total value of made-in-China goods entering America and dodging tariffs may have surpassed $100bn in 2021 according to calculations by The Economist Taken alone these goods would be equivalent to America fourth-largest source of imports even outstripping its purchases from Japan and Germany Moreover if all these goods were counted properly America bilateral goods-trade deficit with China would have smashed its annual record in 2021a damning indictment of the use of tariffs as a way to narrow the trade gap with ChinaTo understand the discrepancy start with the official American trade data According to figures released on February 8th America bought $506bn of goods from China last year That was up by 16% from 2020 a reflection of America booming consumption but still below its import peak reached in 2018 The Chinese trade data are starkly different They show that America bought $576bn of goods from China last year up by nearly 30% from 2020 far and away the most on recordThis gap is particularly striking because the historical pattern is for China to systematically underestimate its exports to America by roughly 18% One reason for the historical underestimate is that China classifies many products shipped via Hong Kong as exports to Hong Kong whereas America counts them as imports from China If the 18% underestimate rule of thumb still applies China exports to America may have reached as much as $680bn last year $174bn more than reported by AmericaThe obvious question to ask is why anyone should privilege China data with its reputation for manipulation over American data In other words perhaps America has counted its purchases from China correctly while China has overstated its sales to America Last year two economists then with the Federal Reserve Hunter Clark and Anna Wong explored this possibility trying to account for the data discrepancyPart of the problem they found did indeed stem from the Chinese side To blunt the impact of the trade war with America China dramatically increased tax rebates for its exports which in turn encouraged exporters to declare more overseas shipments But in working through the trade data for 2020 their conclusion was that the tax changes explained just about 14% of the discrepancy while tariff avoidance explained 62% it was hard to pin down a specific reason for the remainder If the same proportions applied to the trade data for 2021 tariff avoidance would have reached $108bn nearly double the amount in 2020 And there is reason to think it may be even higher: in 2021 China actually decreased some of its tax rebates for exporters whereas those trying to get around America tariffs will only have become more adept at doing soWhat are the tricks of the trade? One approach is to exploit what is known as the “de minimis” rule According to this countries neither charge duties on nor collect full data on imports below a certain value Most developed countries set the threshold at around $200 In 2016 eager to focus scarce customs resources on high-value shipments America lifted its bar to $800 providing importers with ample scope to avoid tariffs Over the 12 months to September 2021 American customs officials counted that 7715m de minimis packages entered the countrya fifth more than during the previous periodwith no estimate of their actual value Some logistics companies now offer services to American importers letting them make bulk shipments to Mexico or Canada and then break them into smaller packages for tariff-free entry into AmericaSome firms may also be evading tariffs by presenting false information to customs inspectors In their paper Mr Clark and Ms Wong noted that American importers could use “low-ball invoices supplied by their Chinese suppliers” There also appears to have been an increase in goods produced in China but falsely labelled as originating from other countries Since 2016 the Customs and Border Protection a federal agency has published a record of its investigations into potential evasions of anti-dumping duties Over the past two years it has launched 37 such investigations up from 24 over the previous three years Virtually all have targeted products from China In January for example customs investigators determined that Simpli Home a furniture company had imported quartz products from China but incorrectly claimed they were from Vietnam In December they found that A&A Pharmachem a supplier of drug ingredients had trans-shipped China-produced xanthan gum through India to avoid tariffsWith tighter rules and closer checks at the border America could stop some of this tariff avoidance Earl Blumenauer a Democratic congressman from Oregon introduced a bill last monthaimed squarely at Chinathat would prevent companies from non-market economies from using the de minimis loophole If customs agents were to open more shipping containers and sift through them carefully they might identify more understated invoices and more mislabelled countries of origin But doing so would require expertise and timeall the more difficult when ports are suffering from backlogs Officials want to speed shipments up not slow them down with yet more inspectionsIndeed America can be at least somewhat grateful for all of the tariff avoidance Duties at the border ultimately act as a tax on American consumers pushing up prices for imported products At a time when inflation is running high tariff-dodging helps to keep costs down For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 26th 2022,The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine,OVER THE past decade intensifying geopolitical risk has been a constant feature of world politics yet the world economy and financial markets have shrugged it off From the contest between China and America to the rise of populist rulers in Latin America and tensions in the Middle East firms and investors have carried on regardless judging that the economic consequences will be containedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRussia invasion of Ukraine is likely to break this pattern because it will result in the isolation of the world 11th-largest economy and one of its largest commodity producers The immediate global implications will be higher inflation lower growth and some disruption to financial markets as deeper sanctions take hold The longer-term fallout will be a further debilitation of the system of globalised supply chains and integrated financial markets that has dominated the world economy since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991Start with the commodity shock As well as being the dominant supplier of gas to Europe Russia is one of the world largest oil producers and a key supplier of industrial metals such as nickel aluminium and palladium Both Russia and Ukraine are major wheat exporters while Russia and Belarus a Russian proxy are big in potash an input into fertilisers The prices of these commodities have been rising this year and are now likely to rise further Amid reports of explosions across Ukraine the price of Brent oil breached $100 per barrel on the morning of February 24th and European gas prices rose by 30%The supply of commodities could be damaged in one of two ways Their delivery might be disrupted if physical infrastructure such as pipelines or Black Sea ports are destroyed Alternatively deeper sanctions on Russia commodity complex could prevent Western customers from buying from it Up until now both sides have been wary about weaponising the trade in energy and commodities which continued throughout the cold war Sanctions after the invasion of Crimea did not prevent BP ExxonMobil or Shell from investing in Russia while American penalties on Rusal a Russian metals firm in 2018 were short-lived Germany decision to mothball the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline on February 22nd was largely symbolic since it does not yet carry gas from Russia to the WestNonetheless the prospect now is of more Western restrictions on Russia natural-resources industry that curtail global supply Russia may retaliate by deliberately creating bottlenecks that raise prices America may lean on Saudi Arabia to increase oil production and prod its domestic shale firms to ramp up outputThe second shock relates to tech and the global financial system While the trade in natural resources is an area of mutual dependency between the West and Russia in finance and tech the balance of economic power is more one-sided America is thus likely to put much tougher Huawei-style sanctions on Russian tech firms limiting their access to cutting-edge semiconductors and software and also blacklist Russia largest two banks Sberbank and VTB or seek to cut Russia off from the SWIFT messaging system that is used for cross-border bank transfersThe tech measures will act as a drag on Russia growth over time and annoy its consumers The banking restrictions will bite immediately causing a funding crunch and impeding financial flows in and out of the country Russia has sought to insulate its economy from precisely this: the share of its invoices denominated in dollars has slumped since its invasion of Crimea in 2014 and it has built up foreign-exchange reserves Still it will hurt Russia will turn to China for its financial needs Already trade between the two countries has been insulated from Western sanctions with only 33% of payments from China to Russia now taking place in dollars down from 97% in 2014Western banks appear to have fairly low exposure to Russia Nonetheless since the modern era of globalisation began in the 1990s no major economy has been cut off from the global financial system and the risk of broader contagion across markets while apparently low cannot be ruled outWhat does all this mean for the global economy? Russia faces a serious but not fatal economic shock as its financial system is isolated For the global economy the prospect is of higher inflation as natural-resource prices rise intensifying the dilemma that central banks face and a possible muting of corporate investment as jittery markets dampen confidenceThe longer-term impact will be to accelerate the division of the world into economic blocs Russia will be forced to tilt east relying more on trade and financial links with China In the West more politicians and firms will ask if a key tenet of globalisationthat you should trade with everyone not just your geopolitical alliesis still valid not just for Russia but other autocracies China will look at Western sanctions on Russia and conclude that it needs to intensify its campaign of self-sufficiency The invasion of Ukraine might not cause a global economic crisis today but it will change how the world economy operates for decades to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterOur recent coverage of the Ukraine crisis can be found here
 Feb 26th 2022,How to avoid a fatal backlash against globalisation,IN 1920 JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES reflected on the Britain he knew before the outbreak of the first world war “The inhabitant of London” he wrote “could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth” Keynes Londoner “regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent” and not long ago the globalisation of the present age seemed a similarly inexorable force A new world war remains unlikely but the uncomfortable echoes of the past in recent history suggest that a closer look at the rise and retreat of 19th-century globalisation might yield valuable lessonsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA work of economic history published in 1999 provides a great starting point “Globalisation and History” by Kevin O’Rourke and Jeffrey Williamson hit shelves at a time of growing unease about the effects of deepening economic integration Then anti-trade activists swarmed meetings of the World Trade Organisation while a few economists began to draw attention to the occasionally troubling distributional effects of globalisation It roared on nonetheless over the first decade after the book publication But in the years since economic nationalism has become a potent political force and the book has come to seem eerily prescientNineteenth-century integration began in earnest around mid-century after decades of instability and insularity Liberalised trade rules helped; Britain repealed its Corn Lawstariffs on imported grainin 1846 But the integration of markets was supercharged by improvements in communication and transport technologies which allowed for faster cheaper and more reliable movement of people goods and information The telegraph steamships and railways brought the economies of Europe and the Americas into close contact with profound consequences In the new world land was abundant and cheap and wages were high The reverse was true in Europe where workers were plentiful and landowners collected fat rents As these markets integrated prices converged In 1870 British wheat prices were 60% above those in America; by 1890 the gap had mostly closed When telegraph cables connected distant financial markets differences in the pricing of various securities vanished almost immediatelySimple trade theory predicts that as differences in the prices of traded goods shrink the cost of factors of production like land and labour should likewise converge Experience in the 19th century bore this out As waves of American grain spilled into European ports land prices in Europe tumbled toward those across the pond In America the real price of land tripled between 1870 and 1913 while in Britain it dropped by nearly 60% Real wages converged as well although the authors note this owed more to migration than trade Nineteenth-century migrant flows were unlike anything in recent memory Between 1870 and 1910 they reduced Sweden labour force by 20% relative to what it otherwise would have been and increased America by 24% These flows transformed labour markets Real wages earned by unskilled labourers in Ireland rose from roughly 60% of the British level in the 1840s to 90% in 1914 thanks entirely to Irish emigrationHow much can really be learned from such a different world? Today migration matters much less than it did in the 19th century Skilled workers account for a far larger share of rich-world workforces and are protected by modern regulations and social safety-nets Trade consists not only of bulk commodity shipments but of components imported and exported multiple times along complex supply chains Forget telegraphs; in meetings today people chat face-to-face with colleagues on other continentsYet a number of lessons appear relevant Start with the issue of convergence in incomes across countries Much of modern theorising about convergence focuses on the role of capital accumulation and technological progress Poor countries grow rich in these models because they invest more and adopt more sophisticated technologies But in the 19th century the integration of markets drove convergence: a force which has also been at work in recent decades The narrowing gap between American and Chinese wages is in part a story of Chinese technological progress Yet it is also one in which hundreds of millions of Chinese workers began participating in a global economy making low-skilled labour more abundant globally and contributing to weaker blue-collar wage growth and higher inequality in rich countriesSecond people in the 19th century generally understood the effects that trade and migration had on their economies and those on the losing end sought political solutions to their troubles Then as now training and education were touted as answers to the problems of unhappy workers But moves to improve schooling were accompanied by a broad shift towards protectionism From the 1870s European economies with the notable exception of Britain began raising tariff rates Over the same period migration policy in the Americas became ever more restrictiveDon’t spoil the endingSo it has gone this time too Work by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and three co-authors found that American counties which were more exposed to imports from China became more likely to vote Republican in presidential elections for example: a shift which in 2016 helped to elect a trade-warring presidentAnd yet third and most important it was not higher tariff barriers or restrictions on migration which plunged the world into the deep and destructive insularity that took hold after 1914; it was war But for war the retreat of globalisation a century ago may have remained modest and short-lived The same may be true today If inattention to the distributional effects of trade can prompt a backlash then a greater commitment to sharing the bounty generated by openness might permit a renewal of economic integrationif the world remains willing to learn from the past Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:A new history of sanctions has unsettling lessons for today Feb 19thThe promise of former eastern-bloc economies is mostly unfulfilled Feb 12thChina may soon become a high-income country Feb 5thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 26th 2022,The many virtues of the yen the rich world cheapest currency,THE LAST shall be first and the first last An emerging theme in capital markets is that securities that generated bumper returns in the era of low inflation sluggish demand and zero interest ratesthink American tech stocksare under pressure while assets that fared horribly in the 2010s oil mining and bank stocks are holding up well If it is cheap inflation-proof and formerly unloved capital is now increasingly drawn to itListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis brings us to the yen the forgotten currency of the least inflation-prone big economy JapanIt once had a solid reputation as a haven like the Swiss franc or the American dollar Whenever a storm blew up the yen rallied But not recently In the volatile weeks since the start of 2022 the yen has mostly moved sideways against the dollar Even Russia invasion of Ukraine did not immediately change its course The yen is a cheap currency that keeps on getting cheaper Its cheapness now looks like an obvious virtueJapan remains the world largest creditor Its net foreign assetswhat its residents own abroad minus what they owe to foreignersamount to around $35trn almost 70% of Japan annual GDP Some of those assets are fixed investments such as factories and office buildings But a chunk is held in bank deposits and in shares and bonds which can be liquidated quicklyIn past periods of high stress such as during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 capital was pulled back into Japan by nervous investors The upshot was an appreciating yen In some instances the effect was dramatic In October 1998 as the crisis surrounding LTCM a busted hedge fund came to a head the yen appreciated from 136 to 112 against the dollar in a matter of days It is rallies such as this that gave the yen its safe-haven reputation When trouble struck you followed the Japanese moneyThis has not worked so reliably lately An important change came with the re-election of Abe Shinzo as prime minister in December 2012 and the subsequent appointment of Kuroda Haruhiko as governor of Japan central bank A key goal of “Abenomics” was to banish Japan chronic deflation through the use of radical monetary policy including huge central-bank purchases of bonds and equities A result of all the sustained money-printing was a much weaker yen but not much stronger inflation The yen safe-haven status wore off says Peter Tasker a seasoned observer of Japan economy and marketsMight it be restored? In a world in which inflation is a serious concern there is a lot to be said for a currency which holds its purchasing power The yen is now very cheap in real terms against a broad basket of other currencies On a measure calculated by the Bank for International Settlements the yen is now more competitive than at any time since the series began in 1994 The Economist Big Mac Index a light-hearted gauge of purchasing power tells a similar story The exchange rate required to equalise the price of a Big Mac in Tokyo and New York is 67; but the yen currently trades at 115 to the dollar On this basis the yen is undervalued by 42% Even if the yen continues to trade sideways it is likely to become cheaper in real terms Japan inflation rate is currently just 05% America is 75%In the near term risk aversion and rising interest rates in America will support the dollar But the more the Federal Reserve has to do to contain inflation the greater the risk of a hard landing for America economy The dollar might eventually find itself at the centre of a storm In such a scenario the yen would rally strongly Kit Juckes of Société Générale a French bank sees a risk that dollar-yen falls below 100 in the next year or two Traders might wait for signs of trouble in America economy before buying For those who want exposure now Japan stockmarket has appeal It too is cheap: it trades on 136 times expected earnings And for cautious souls looking for a cheap segment of a cheap market in a cheap currency Japan banks offer a dividend yield of 4% and trade on a single-digit multiple of expected earningsThe tides are shifting Not so long ago many investors were fearful of “Japanification” in which economies got stuck in too low a gear to stop prices and bond yields from falling But now inflation is roaring back and interest rates are on the rise In a world turning upside-down the yen old-fashioned virtues ought to jog the memoryRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Are financial crossbreeds monstrosities or labradoodles?

 Feb 25th 2022,The battle to modernise Italy's corporate governance,TWENTY YEARS ago Mediobanca was the epicentre of the salotto buono the “fine drawing room” a group of old-fashioned firms whose web of cross-connections dominated Italian business Times have changed Today the Milanese bank is in the modernising camp in a fight with two super-seniors over the future of 190-year-old Generali Italy biggest insurer Its outcome could decide whether Italy corporate governance is at last thrust into the 21st centuryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe power struggle pits Alberto Nagel boss of Mediobanca against Leonardo Del Vecchio the 86-year-old founder of Luxottica an eyewear giant and Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone a 78-year-old construction tycoon Both sides own big stakes in Generali: Mediobanca controls 17% while the pair together own 14% At stake is the future direction and governance of one of Italy biggest firms Mr Nagel thinks Generali is on the right path under the stewardship of Philippe Donnet the group French CEO whose mandate is up for renewal at the annual general meeting AGM in April Messrs Del Vecchio and Caltagirone are agitating for regime change at the venerable Trieste-based insurerExactly why is not clear They have not come up with a business plan or an alternative candidate for CEO They seem unhappy with Generali mergers-and-acquisitions strategy which they consider too timid The firm recent takeover of Cattolica a parochial rival was not the kind of deal they want to see which is big and international They complain that Generali should do more to digitise its operationsIn fact Mr Donnet seems to have done a good job at Generali He has strengthened its capital position through the sale of peripheral businesses and improvements in profitability He has lowered its debt burden and changed its business mix away from products that eat up too much capital such as guaranteed life-insurance contracts to fee-paying ones such as property and casualty policies In recent months he has led acquisitions that increased Generali share in core European markets And Generali has pioneered software that writes insurance contracts on its ownWhat more Generali has become a cash machine that makes institutional investors happy says Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research When Mr Donnet presented his three-year plan in December he promised cumulative dividends of almost €6bn $68bn forecast an annual rise in earnings per share of 6% to 8% and announced a €500m buybackSo what motivates the dissident duo? A loss of influence perhaps In the old days of the salotto the CEO of Generali would dine with important shareholders before announcing strategic decisions or new board members Those days are gone as the insurer continues to bring its governance in line with European norms Under rules Mr Donnet introduced in 2020 the outgoing board last month recommended new directors for the ten-strong bodyas is the case at some continental blue-chips The duo dislike the new rulesOn the face of it they scored a victory on February 18th when Gabriele Galateri di Genola Generali chairman said he would step down at the end of his third term in April But Mr Galateri did not leave because the duo pushed him out He left because he supports Mr Donnet drive to modernise Generali: under the new governance rules three terms is the maximumIt is likely in fact that Mr Donnet will still be in his job after the AGM on April 29th Analysts assume that Mr Nagel and investors who represent 35% of shares will prevail This may upset the silver-haired rebelsbut there is a silver lining too As top shareholders they stand to pocket giant dividends in the coming years

 Feb 19th 2022,Will prediction markets live up to the hype?,THE LINE between investing and gambling has always been thin This is especially true for prediction markets where punters bet on events ranging from the banal “will average gas prices be higher this week than last week?” to the light-hearted “who will win best actress at the Oscars?” Prediction markets have something of a cult following among finance types who rave about the value of putting a price on any event anywhere in the world Such prices capture insights into the likelihood of something happening by forcing betters to put money where their mouths are But critics argue such markets will fail to grow beyond a niche group reducing the value of their predictions in the processListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe debate has been reignited by a new “event contract” exchange–a market where traders can buy and sell contracts tied to event outcomesrun by Kalshi a New York-based startup The firm has made headlines because it earned approval to run America first such exchange without regulatory limits on the scale of activitya feat that has long eluded its predecessors PredictIt one of the most popular American prediction markets operates as a non-profit research project limited to 5000 betters for each event The size of bets is capped too at $850 per person per question Kalshi overcame such hurdles by consulting American regulators for two years to earn their trust says its boss Tarek Mansour He believes this could make event contracts a real asset class like optionsThat may be why the startup has attracted so much interest It counts big names from Sequoia Capital to Charles Schwab as backers A former member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Kalshi regulator has joined the firm boardKalshi timing is also opportunistic Retail traders have ventured far beyond blue-chip stocks to assets such as options and cryptocurrencies The firm sees event contracts as a natural extension of that curiosity And Kalshi specifically looks for events ripped from headlines says Luana Lopes Lara one of its co-founders For instance it launched markets on US Supreme Court cases in December 2021In the longer run it hopes to attract more sophisticated investors Why might they join a seemingly game-like platform? For one they could make money off less-informed amateurs They may also use it to hedge against risks An investor with stock in the American construction industry for instance might have bet against President Joe Biden infrastructure bill to cushion its losses if the bill had failedBut there are several barriers to broader adoption One is that there is a fundamental difference between betting on events and betting on stocks Public companies generally engage in profitable projects so shares tend to have positive returns; over a long enough period investors would make money even if they picked stocks at random That draws in more participants In prediction markets by contrast the game is zero-sum says Eric Zitzewitz an economist from Dartmouth College The pay-out of one trader is the loss of whoever takes the other side of the betA bigger turn-off may be lack of liquidity Sophisticated investors will be reluctant punters if they cannot make large trades with ease In 2002 Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs two banks launched a market for trading event contractssimilar to what Kalshi now offers though only open to large investorson major macroeconomic data releases such as employment numbers It closed some years later most likely because investors who wanted to trade on such data stuck instead with bets on the entire stockmarket using options and share indices; traditional assets had much larger volumes and were therefore easier to trade In many cases liquidity matters more than having a perfect hedge says a trader at a large investment bankLooking abroad offers a clue to where volume might come from Smarkets a popular betting exchange in Britain where regulations are lighter than America has seen the most activity on major political events The American presidential election in 2020 was its largest market to date with more than £20m $27m traded says Matthew Shaddick of Smarkets Kalshi political markets are also finding some success: its most popular to date was on whether Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell would be replaced by December 2021 Markets on elections however have yet to be approved in America Mr Mansour says Kalshi is “working with regulators” to change this Perhaps prediction markets should open a market on their own success For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 19th 2022,Labour v capital in the post-lockdown economy,“A GOOD COMPROMISE” the saying goes “is when both parties are dissatisfied” Dissatisfaction rages in the post-lockdown economy Households say that price-gouging companies are jacking up prices contributing to an inflation rate across the rich world of 66% year on year Companies bat such accusations aside believing that they are the truly wronged party They complain that staff have become work-shy ingrates who demand ever-higher wages Earlier this month Andrew Bailey the governor of the Bank of England courted controversy by suggesting that workers should moderate their wage demandseven as he failed to tell companies not to raise their pricesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA “battle of the markups” between higher wages and higher shop prices is under way And there can only be one winner all else being equal Broadly speaking economic output must flow either to owners of capital in the form of profits dividends and rents or to labour as wages salaries and perks Economists refer to this as the “capital” or “labour” share of GDP Which of the two has the upper hand in the post-lockdown economy?The Economist has compiled a range of indicators to answer this question First we calculate a high-frequency measure of the capital-labour share across 30 mostly rich countries In 2020 the aggregate labour share across this group soared see chart 1 This was largely because firms continued to pay people wageshelped in large part by government-stimulus programmeseven as GDP collapsed Advantage labourMore recently however the battle seems to have shifted in favour of capital Since reaching a peak in 2020 the rich-world labour share has fallen by 23 percentage points Frustratingly the data only go up to September 2021and most economists anyway argue that labour share is not a perfect gauge of economic fairness since it is devilishly hard to measure The evidence since then suggests that countries fall into one of three buckets depending on how the battle of the markups is playing outIn the first camp is Britain There underlying wage growth is in the region of 5% a year unusually fast by rich-world standards But corporations seem not to have a great deal of pricing power meaning that they are struggling to fully offset higher costs in the form of higher prices Digging into Britain national accounts we estimate that the nominal profit in pounds per unit of goods and services sold is only roughly as high as it was in early 2019 even as unit labour costs are rising by about 3% per year Labour seems to be winning out at the expense of capital Perhaps Mr Bailey has a pointThe second group consists of most other rich countries outside America There neither labour nor capital seems able to triumph After correcting for pandemic-related distortions Japan pay growth appears to be slowing to below 1% a year suggest data from Goldman Sachs a bank Pay settlements in Italy and Spain are treading water while wage growth in Australia France and Germany remains well below where it was before the pandemic Workers in these places are not really joining in with the inflationary partyBut businesses are not soaring either In Europe pre-tax profit margins as measured in the national accounts have risen in recent months but remain below where they were just before the pandemic In Japan the “recurring” profits before tax of large and medium-sized companies recently returned to pre-pandemic levels The profits of smaller companies remain well below howeverIn the third group sits America Here wage growth is rapid at about 5% a year But as shown in their most recent financial results big listed American companies are doing a better job of protecting margins than analysts had expected A series of unusually large stimulus payments may mean that households are able to absorb the higher prices that companies impose In early February Amazon said it would increase the price of its Prime membership package by 17% in its home marketeven as it chose not to announce price rises in other parts of the worldSome firms are increasing their margins despite soaring costs Tyson an American meat producer reported an 18% jump in the costs of its inputs in the most recent quarter compared with a year earlier a 196% increase in its average selling prices and a 40% rise in its adjusted operating profits It says that rising meat prices have not slowed demandAn economy-wide measure of corporate margins is rising fast Dario Perkins of TS Lombard a financial-services firm breaks down America rise in unit prices since the start of the pandemic into companies’ labour costs non-labour costs and profits Wages are rising but nonetheless markups are responsible for more than 70% of inflation since late 2019 he finds see chart 2 In a recent report analysts at Bank of America argue that greater pricing power helps explain why American equities have a higher price-earnings ratio than European onesGood you’re all unhappyThe story is not over yet Some economists wonder if workers will before long demand even higher wages to compensate for higher prices in the shops There is some evidence of this in America and Britain where wage growth seems to be accelerating Businesses’ expectations for future wage settlements remain fairly conservative though that could soon change If wages do start to grow more quickly the cycle of price rises and compensating wage demands might start up all over again Before long the post-lockdown economy could look like the ultimate compromisewhere nobody is satisfied For more expert

 Feb 19th 2022,Citigroup is disposing of its international retail network,THE “DILLY-DALLYING” to use the term put forward by Jane Fraser soon after taking over Citigroup in early 2021 is almost over Outside America and a few international centres the distinctive blue branches that were once common features of big cities around the world will soon be vestiges of another era much like black yellow and red Kodak signs The New York-based bank which built a reputation over decades as a global consumer giant is in retreat From now on it will focus primarily on commercial banking and wealth management serving large and medium-sized businesses and millionaires The retail branches it retains will mostly be concentrated in a few domestic markets such as New York and CaliforniaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA series of announcements have already been made: in August the sale of the Australian retail operations to National Australia Bank; in October the wind-down of those in South Korea; in December the sale of its Philippine business to UnionBank of the Philippines; in January a disposal of Indonesian Malaysian Thai and Vietnamese branches to Singapore United Overseas Bank UOB whose chief executive Wee Ee Cheong remarked that in a single deal his institution had added what it had taken “even Citi” half a century to build; and also in January the sale of Citi consumer business in Taiwan to DBS another Singaporean bankThe remaining announcements are expected to come soon One of the most important will be about India where Citi has long had an outsized influence; Axis Bank India third-largest private-sector lender is rumoured to be close to picking up the business for around $25bn Operations in China Russia Poland and Bahrain are still in play Added to the disposal list recently has been the wholly owned Banamex Mexico third-largest bank Delay would only erode whatever value remains in these operations as employees and customers look for a stable homeCiti retreat is not unique HSBC which came closest to having Citi-like global ambitions in retail banking has pared backthough not as dramatically at least in part because its core market Hong Kong is much smaller than Citi Australia ANZ gave up on a pan-Asia strategy six years ago Like Citi these banks have kept offices around the world for corporate business from lending to treasury servicesAs a result it is tempting to view Citi retreat as just another failed attempt at world domination in consumer banking But it differs from past failures in two respects: the sheer ambition behind the initial expansion and the legacy it leaves in retail-banking markets around the worldImportant to ReedThe expansion was premised on rethinking global finance with a vast network serving everyone everywhere in every way As with many ambitious plans Citi global push was in response to problems at home In the 1970s regulatory restraints resulted in a retail-branch network that was limited to New York City unprofitable and unable to provide the funds Citi wanted for its lending business While on holiday John Reed a senior executive wrote a seven-page “memo from the beach” arguing that one option would be for Citi to dump retail banking altogether a path later taken by Bankers Trust now part of Deutsche Bank Bank of New York and Boston State Street among other institutions The other option was to go very bigMr Reed posited that rather than thinking about retail banking as deposits and loans Citi should answer the expansive financial needs of families whatever they may be Through “success transfer” as the bank dubbed it solutions developed in one market could be rolled out in others creating economies of scale where they would not exist in a self-contained local institution The bank came up with a clever slogan to fit: “Citi Never Sleeps”Years of heavy losses were incurred to create a new form of retail banking components of which are now so familiar that it is hard to imagine they once didn’t exist These included ATMs Citi was the first big American bank to introduce customer-friendly machines at scale credit cards of which it went on to become the world largest issuer and electronic payments which it was one to the first to offer to retail customersCiti reputation as a driving force in financial technology stretched into the 1990s when more than a million customers received floppy disks biannually with software updates enabling proto-internet banking Aware of the identification challenge that existed in a transition from human contact in branches the bank experimented with the retina-scanning technology that along with facial recognition is only now becoming commonThese innovations helped drive international expansion Mr Reed became the bank chief executive in 1984 and an ever-wider array of markets were opened extending from Nigeria and Sweden to via a Hong Kong acquisition Thailand as well as particularly swanky efforts in London and Geneva The bank opened a representative office in Beijing too Augmenting the branches were call processing and innovation centres in numerous places including Silicon Valley the Philippines and perhaps most importantly India where they played a critical role in germinating the country vibrant technology-outsourcing industryThe bank drive was a magnet for bright people Alumni included a former prime minister and the current finance minister of Pakistan a former central-bank governor of the Philippines and the future leaders of innumerable financial institutions including the largest private-sector bank in India in terms of assets HDFC Bankwhose market capitalisation alone is more than 90% of Citiand DBS whose present chief executive came to the bank after being a star at CitiIn many ways this reflected Citi success but it also illustrated its vulnerability “Success transfer” ultimately meant creating capable competitors Local regulators created their own obstacles limiting the rights of foreign banks to open branches or link international accounts thereby undermining economies of scale Technological innovation dimmed after Mr Reed departure in 2000 Rivals including those run by former Citibankers copied Citi innovations sometimes improving on them or offering them more cheaplyThen came the global financial crisis in 2007 After incurring huge losses on over $300bn of risky assets Citi required a bail-outrevealing that in a pinch it was an American not global institution This was underscored by stringent new domestic regulations complicating when not blocking international transactionsThat began a long period of contraction Early to go was the German retail operation for $77bn then others in Turkey Brazil Egypt and over a dozen other countries It was as if the United Nations of banking was being unwound The Asian and Mexican operations remained each in different ways offering much potential But Ms Fraser who joined the bank in 2004 and was less tied to the old strategy concluded that the bank lacked the scale needed to compete in many of its marketsA striking feature of the final reckoning has been how little the Asian operations really mattered to Citi results Their presence vastly exceeded their financial relevance: the Asian businesses that are being sold accounted for only 16% of group earnings in 2021 This helps explain the paucity of bidders None of the businesses have been bought by Standard Chartered or HSBC and their own far-reaching operations are now questioned Years ago JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon formerly of Citi considered replicating its global network only to conclude that building a retail business market by market wasn’t viable It is also striking that Chinese banks the new Goliaths have made barely any effort to build foreign retail operationsBuyers of Citi Asian assets to the extent they have emerged are fully or somewhat local True Singapore DBS and UOB have been willing to acquire abroad but Taiwan and Vietnam are hardly far-flung especially for banks whose home market is small and serves as a hub for Asian finance Local and regional consolidation would seem to be more reflective of the timesSystemic rewardsAs Ms Fraser pushes on with the dismantlement there will doubtless be gnashing of teeth within an institution that looks to many outsiders like a shadow of its former self It may be some consolation to current and former Citibankers that the technological components of Mr Reed vision have been taken up both through interlinkages in the global financial systemATMs and credit cards have long been ubiquitousand through fintech operators such as Grab in Singapore Ant Group in China and Wise in Britain that enable electronic payments and remittances Citi experience in short suggests that the benefits of globalised finance can be more easily enjoyed by the system as a whole than by any single institution For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign

 Feb 19th 2022,The true cost of empty offices,CITIES HAVE often bounced back from crises From pandemics and earthquakes to floods and fires the world urban powerhouses have emerged stronger when faced with adversity After the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the city in 1666 a raft of fire-safety regulations were ushered in Builders swapped timber for brick or stone Walls were made thicker Streets became wider When cholera tore through America in the 1850s New York and other cities introduced sewage systems and public parks As the disease spread to Paris authorities there too introduced

support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday urban areas face a challenge of a different sort With the mass return to office work still uncertain the pandemic has sharpened debate about what the future holds for their commercial hubs Key business districts such as Manhattan the City of London Tokyo Marunouchi and La Défense in Paris have borne the brunt of the office exodus Before lockdowns the 21 largest business districts in the world housed 45m workers and around a fifth of the headquarters of Fortune Global 500 companies according to EY and the Urban Land Institute When covid-19 emptied offices around the world most professional work shifted to home offices or kitchen tables As the pandemic stretches into a third year the fate of urban business districts remains unclear Can they continue to attract investment and talent or will new work patterns jeopardise their commercial dominance?On the face of it things could have been worse for the owners of gleaming city office towers Unlike the retail and hospitality sectors office tenants have mostly continued to pay rent and analysts have retracted many of their worst projections Leasing activity even picked up in cities like London towards the end of 2021The reality however is far from rosy Home-working has hit demand for office space with vacancy rates rising faster in business districts than anywhere else Globally unoccupied offices make up 12% of the total up from 8% before covid Across London 18% of offices are vacant In New York the share is nearly 16% More than one in five offices in San Francisco are empty In Hong Kong where downsizing has become common net effective rent which is adjusted for abatements or incentives dropped by more than 7% in 2021 after falling by more than 17% in 2020Rather than lowering rents landlords are offering more freebies than ever to retain tenants or attract new ones In Manhattan cash gifts for tenantstypically used for kitting out new office spacehave more than doubled since 2016 Across America the average number of rent-free months has risen to its highest since 2013 Some property developers remain optimistic betting that demand for office space will eventually bounce back But with each new variant of covid-19 plans for a wide-scale return to the office have been delayed and delayed again And changing patterns of attendance look set to reduce the overall demand for spaceFinancial markets reflect the darkening mood Offices particularly in business districts are rapidly losing ground to better-performing areas of property such as warehouses and apartments Having traditionally formed the core of commercial-property portfolios in America offices accounted for less than a fifth of transactions in 2021 Globally investors spent more on apartments for the first time Foreign investment into offices also fell below the pre-pandemic average in countries such as America and Australia in 2021 By contrast foreign investment in warehouses more than doubled in these marketsValuations mirror the uncertainty too Prices of buildings in business districts have taken a hit even as commercial-property prices have boomed in other parts of cities In San Francisco Financial District for example property prices have slumped by nearly a fifth since the end of 2019 according to the latest figures Across the broader metropolitan area they have increased by more than 5% In Manhattan they have fallen by around 8% since the start of the pandemic Asian cities have fared better Office prices across Seoul for instance have risen by more than a third since the end of 2019 In Singapore they are up by more than a tenthMost investors take a long-term view so capital allocated to offices will be locked in for years But sentiment is shifting away from cities with a large concentration of offices and towards smaller markets with a broader mix of buildings A survey of investors with assets under management of more than $50bn by CBRE a property firm showed a preference in 2021 for markets like Phoenix and Denver over New York and Chicago The biggest business hubs will no doubt continue to attract large sums: London offices are forecast to attract £60bn $81bn of overseas capital over the next few years according to Knight Frank But deserted office blocks in dense commercial districts will continue to cast an ominous shadowLandlords insist concerns are overblown Despite many buildings remaining stubbornly empty they maintain that demand for the best space is holding up True some prime properties still attract plenty of suitors Tenants are increasingly swapping ageing office blocks for modern greener workplaces with better air-filtration systems and higher-quality amenities But these high-end properties represent 20% or less of buildings in most cities They do however make up a disproportionate share of investment activity: in New York just nine out of 69 office transactions accounted for 80% of the total amount invested in 2021The gap between the best assets and the rest of the market will widen further Refurbishments may rejuvenate some tired-looking buildings For many older assets however inflation shortages of labour and materials in the construction industry and the high cost of upgrading buildings to meet tougher environmental standards will make it harder to justify the expenseThe consequences for business districts could be far-reaching The mass departure of bankers lawyers and other professionals also hurts the cafes restaurants and other small businesses that serve them Many were already struggling with supply-chain disruptions labour shortages and rising costs Lockdowns cost Sydney economy an estimated A$250m $178m a week and 40000 jobs Across New York City more than a third of small businesses closed during lockdowns; before the pandemic the sector accounted for over half of private-sector jobs in the cityCivic

passenger numbers are projected to leave a £15bn hole in the finances of London transport authority by 2024 New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority which runs the city subway is forecasting a $14bn deficit in 2025 as federal aid is phased outBusiness districts are taking defensive measures A common approach has been to make them more vibrant a trend that was already under way before the pandemic The City of London is proposing more “all-night cultural celebrations” traffic-free streets on weekends and at least 1500 new apartments by 2030 while Canary Wharf has added bars restaurants and pleasure boats to draw in younger crowds Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority concedes it may need to rethink the mix of buildings in the downtown district in addition to planning more cycle

 Feb 19th 2022,A new history of sanctions has unsettling lessons for today,JUST AFTER the end of the first world war and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary one observer noted that “every clock in Prague [was] gone melted for the metals” Another in Vienna saw children “wrapped in paper for want of sheets and blankets” At the time much of Europe was under strict economic sanctions as western powers tried to hold the post-war peace and restrain communism It was the first time that the “economic weapon” the title of Nicholas Mulder new book had been used but by no means the last By the 2010s a third of the world population lived under sanctions Prominent among the current targets is Russia which will face further sanctions if it invades Ukraine Mr Mulder of Cornell University looks at sanctions over the three decades after the first world warand reaches unsettling conclusionsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the

troops launched countless brutal sieges against French garrisons often starving them into submission Blockades were an important part of the toolkit of the naval wars of the 18th century Sanctions were and are different Rather than being imposed by one country on another they often involved groups of countries coming together to punish rogue states The formation of the League of Nations in 1919-20 made co-ordinated action easier And rather than being seen as an act of war sanctions were often supposed to prevent itSanctions were also the product of the first great wave of globalisation In the 70 years to 1914 trade flows rose from 5% of global GDP to 14% then an all-time high With economies ever more integrated like-minded governments had many points of leverage over renegades whether by denying them the supply of crucial raw materials or by refusing to buy their goodsThe role of finance truly distinguished sanctions from previous economic warfare In 1870-1914 annual capital flows averaged 4% of global GDP The Allied powers controlled the world main financial centres Economists as well as traditional military types thus helped design sanctions They aimed to hit aggressor states where they were weakest: in their financing requirementsMr Mulder book is filled with anecdotes of how sanctions worked in practice As signs of impending war grew in 1935 Italian companies such as Pirelli tyres Fiat cars and Montecatini chemicals were denied financing for their import needs by the Bank of England By August 1941 expansionist Japan was cut off from the rest of the world economy having lost 90% of its foreign oil supply and 70% of its trade revenues Enforcing sanctions required a great deal of effort in a world of increasing financial ingenuity In the late 1910s Banco Holandés de la América del Sud a Buenos Aires subsidiary of a Dutch bank used five different names to undertake transactions for various Latin American subsidiaries of German banksWilliam Arnold-Forster a British administrator argued that sanctions could “make our enemies unwilling that their children should be born” Indeed they could have horrific effects Of the three main weapons targeting civilians during the periodair power gas warfare and economic blockadeblockade was by far the deadliest Mr Mulder argues “Pens seem so much cleaner instruments than bayonets” Arnold-Forster wryly notedWhether sanctions achieved their objectives was another matter Small countries could be bullied into obedience such as on two occasions in the 1920s when the threat of sanctions stopped skirmishes in the Balkans from escalating into wider war Bigger powers were tougher nuts to crack Overall “most economic sanctions have not worked”the first lesson of Mr Mulder book Most significantly they did not stop Germany from choosing warSanctions sometimes failed because of insufficient political will For a long time American opinion had it that sanctions were fundamentally un-American an anachronistic form of European-style imperialism In other cases financial globalisation constrained rather than widened sanctioners’ room for manoeuvre Britain refrained from imposing a severe financial blockade of Nazi Germany in the mid-1930s in part because British banks held huge amounts of German debt In the event of sanctions the Reich would stop servicing this debt and British financiers worried that the City would face a solvency crisisThe second lesson of Mr Mulder book is that sanctions can have unintended consequences By the 1930s global politics and economics had radically changed from the 1920s The Great Depression had sent many governments down a protectionist route Global trade was in a long slump Fascism was on the marchDoom loopSanctions Mr Mulder shows added fuel to the fire Governments that believed themselves vulnerable to sanctions withdrew even further from the global economy in order to secure strategic independence In the 1930s Japan sought to develop a “yen bloc” an economic zone including Korea and Taiwan so as to reduce dependence on the Allied powers In the mid-1930s Germany gunned for “raw-materials freedom” in part via the construction of massive capacity for the synthetic production of oil Anyone witnessing Russia efforts in recent years to wean itself off Western finance may conclude that nothing much has changed It also necessitated conquest “I need Ukraine” said Adolf Hitler in 1939 “so that they cannot again starve us out like in the last war”In that sense the international search for effective sanctions and the ultra-nationalist search for autarky “became locked in an escalatory spiral” Sanctions did not work in a deglobalising world and contributed to its continued fracturing in turn setting the stage for the second world war Mr Mulder is too careful a historian to labour the parallels between what happened in the inter-war period and today when geopolitics is once again fractious and globalisation is in retreat But the lessons are sobering For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Feb 12th 2022,Asia is not feeling the same price pressures as the West,INFLATION HAS shot to multi-decade highs in much of the rich world during the past year with the effect of supply constraints covid restrictions and a burgeoning economic recovery all helping to drive consumer prices higher In Asia however pressure on prices is much weaker Why?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn much of the regionin China Hong Kong India Indonesia the Philippines and Vietnaminflation is in fact below average levels over the decade before the pandemic notes Abdul Abiad director of macroeconomic research at the Asian Development Bank Where it is higher than the average for 2010-2019in Malaysia Singapore South Korea Taiwan and Thailandit is by around two percentage points or lessThe divergence between East and West is the result of several factors Some of the disparity with the booming prices seen in North America and Europe as well as many non-Asian emerging markets comes down to food Whereas prices of food globally have surged Mr Abiad notes that the effect has been uneven Maize and wheat prices rose by 18% and 20% respectively in the 12 months to the end of January In contrast the price of rice fell by around a fifth in the same period In a country like the Philippines rice makes up a quarter of the food share of the consumer-price index and one-tenth of the entire index In China in particular average wholesale pork prices dropped by more than half in the 12 months to January as the African swine fever epidemic that has raged through the country since 2018 began to abateThe impact of food prices is most obvious in developing economies but there are reasons why Asia richer countries have recorded lower inflationary pressure too For one supply-chain bottlenecks are not as severe as they are in the West The cost of shipping a 40-foot container from Shanghai to Rotterdam has risen by around 60% in the past year to $13686 according to Drewry a supply-chain consultancy In contrast the price for the return journey is little more than a tenth of that at $1445 a figure which has dropped by 1% in the past year Surveys of purchasing managers suggest that supplier delays are still worsening in most of Europe and America but falling in China India Indonesia Thailand and VietnamThe different ways in which countries have emerged from the pandemic matter too Researchers at Capital Economics another consultancy note that Asia “reopening” inflation in consumer services remains low The rise in prices for recreation and cultural services in Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore South Korea and Taiwan is half or less of the American year-on-year rate of around 4% The difference may be caused by more gradual loosening of restrictions as well as a dearth of international touristsNot all forms of inflationary pressure can be avoided Energy prices are more influenced by global trends than those for most other goods and services Rising energy costs have been the biggest contributor to the inflation surge in Asia making up as much as a third of the total increase recently according to analysts at Goldman Sachs a bankMany economies in the region may face higher interest rates despite their milder inflation Potential interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year raise the threat of a stronger dollar which would bring imported inflation to Asia Monetary policymakers in Indonesia Singapore and South Korea have already announced small steps to tighten monetary policy They are unlikely to be the last 
 Feb 12th 2022,Who buys the dirty energy assets public companies no longer want?,THE FIRST law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed just transferred from one place to another The same seems to apply to the energy industry itself Pressed by investors activists and governments the West six biggest oil companies have shed $44bn of mostly fossil-fuel assets since the start of 2018 The industry is eyeing total disposals worth $128bn in the coming years says Wood Mackenzie a consultancy Last month ExxonMobil said it would divest its Canadian shale business; Shell put its remaining Nigerian oilfields on the block But much of the time these outmoded units are not being closed down Instead they are moving from the floodlit world of listed markets to shadier

multitaskOKMany are ending up in the hands of private-equity PE firms In the past two years alone these bought $60bn-worth of oil gas and coal assets through 500 transactionsa third more than they invested in renewables see chart Some have been multibillion-dollar deals with giants such as Blackstone Carlyle and KKR carving out huge oilfields coal-fired power plants or gas grids from energy groups miners and utilities Many other deals sealed by smaller rivals get little publicity This sits uncomfortably with the credo of many pension funds universities and other investors in private funds 1485 of which representing $39trn in assets have pledged to divest fossil fuels But few seem ready to leave juicy returns on the tablePE love affair with oil is not new Between 2002 and 2015 rising global demand for the fuel pushed its price above $100 a barrel prompting funds focused on “upstream” assetsexploration and production especially fracking wellsto mushroom But then Saudi Arabia and its allies eager to crush American shale flooded the market causing drilling firms to go bust and deals to sour Buyout funds targeting fossil fuels posted ten-year internal rates of return IRRs of -07% at the end of June 2021 reckons Preqin a data firmBut the wind has shifted As demand for oil and gas persists while dwindling investment in production limits supply prices are rising again boosting producers’ profits BP for instance raked in $128bn last year the most since 2013 Shell predicts IRRs of 20% for investments in upstream projects against 10% for renewable ones Buyout funds which often have a ten-year life can hope to make their money back in half the time most of it from the operating cash flows the acquisitions generate rather than from reselling assets They can source capital cheaply: in contrast to the majors which have an annual cost of equity of about 10% they typically finance energy deals with 80% debt at interest rates of 4-5% And discounts imposed on “brown” assets by the stockmarket linked to sustainability factors rather than financial ones are causing a lot of mispricing on which private funds thrivePE managers have also been canny in changing their strategies Many are no longer marketing energy funds except those with a focus on renewables Instead upstream assets are being lumped with others into funds labelled “growth” or “opportunistic” which cover a range of industries Private-debt funds snap up oil and gas loans from banks The biggest shift has been a swoop on “midstream” assets chiefly pipelines by private-infrastructure funds Because their revenues are contracted and paid for by big clientsenergy majors and utilitiesthey are deemed very safe while also generating attractive IRRs in the high teens Some firms do everything In June a fund manager owned by Brookfield which is based in Canada acquired joint ownership of the entire portfolio of North American oil and gas loans of ABN AMRO a Dutch bank In July Brookfield agreed to pay $68bn for Canada fourth-largest pipeline companya day after touting a $7bn fundraising round for a green “transition” fundPE firms say they can be trusted to manage those assets well Because they own controlling stakes and escape the constant gaze of public markets they see themselves as being in a unique position to improve efficiency and reduce emissions But the incentives to pocket dividends first and worry about the rest later are growing Global private-capital “dry powder”money raised by funds that has yet to be spenthas hit a $33trn record With so much to spend managers want to do a lot of deals which in turn means many don’t have time to craft considered decarbonisation plans for assetsInvestors seem in no rush to tighten the taps A recent survey by Probitas Partners which helps private firms raise funding vehicles shows investors have almost no appetite for oil funds today But few have policies that exclude case-by-case transactions by broader funds Using data from PEI Media The Economist has looked at eight PE firms that have closed fossil-fuel deals in the past two years The investors in some of their latest energy-flavoured vehicles include 53 pension funds 23 universities and 32 foundations Many are from America such as Teacher Retirement System of Texas the University of San Francisco and the Pritzker Traubert Foundation but that is partly because more institutions based there disclose PE commitments The list also features Britain West Yorkshire Pension Fund and China LifeOver time some investors may decide to opt out of funding their portion of fossil-fuel deals But a third yet more opaque class stands ready to step in: state-owned firms and sovereign funds operating in the shadows Last month Saudi Aramco the Kingdom national oil company acquired a 30% stake in a refinery in Poland and Somoil an Angolan group bought offshore oil assets from France Total In 2020 Singapore GIC was part of the group that paid $10bn for a stake in an Emirati pipelineCould banks act as a restraining force? Big lenders in Europe are soon to face “green” stress tests; many have announced net-zero targets Their appetite for upstream deals is “diminishing rapidly” says a Wall Street banker Yet for big deals bond markets remain open Smaller deals can tap private-debt markets And although Western banks shun loans to midstream projects Asian ones do not Liquidity still abounds Last month a group of investors led by EIG an American buyout firm hired Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to help it refinance the $11bn loan it took in June to buy Saudi pipelines No matter how deep you dig into the capital structure the laws of thermodynamics still seem to apply For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Feb 12th 2022,The promise of former eastern-bloc economies is mostly unfulfilled,WHETHER OR NOT Vladimir Putin sends Russian troops into Ukraine increasingly icy relations between East and West may signal a coda to the era of increasing global economic integration which began with the collapse of communism In the mid-1980s scarcely a quarter of the world population lived in economies which could be considered open to foreign trade and capital flows according to an estimate published in 1995 by Jeffrey Sachs Andrew Warner Anders Aslund and Stanley Fischer Less than a decade later the figure had jumped above 50% and a three-decade burst of rapid globalisation was under wayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe era of openness has been good for much of the world Yet the performance of the countries of the former eastern bloc has been decidedly mixed While some like Poland and Latvia grew faster than the emerging world as a whole between 1992 and 2019 Russia did little better than the far richer American economy and Ukraine did worse Thirty years on the question of why some succeeded while others failed remains difficult to answerIn the critical early years transitional governments faced huge challenges Their economies lacked functioning labour and capital markets and were burdened by uncompetitive manufacturing sectors and a forbidding macroeconomic picture In the early 1990s inflation exceeded 1000% in Estonia Latvia and Lithuania and 2000% in Kazakhstan Russia and Ukraine Economists broadly agreed on what should be done: economies needed to be opened to trade and market forces state enterprises sold off and new institutions built They differed though on how fast to do it Some including Mr Sachs argued for a speedy transitionan approach dubbed “shock therapy”reckoning that rapid reform would reallocate capital faster and put food on shelves sooner Critics reckoned that a slower pace would accommodate more institutional reform and win more political supportIn practice most governments wasted no time opening to trade and confronting macroeconomic challenges Strategies diverged with respect to privatisation Some like Estonia moved relatively slowly matching buyers to enterprises one at a time Others like Russia favoured rapid privatisation through schemes which transferred shares to existing managers and employees though the Russian state retained stakes in critical industries like oil and gas Building new institutions took longest of all Early results were mostly disappointing A few countries notched up healthy growth: in Poland GDP per person on a purchasing-power-parity basis rose at an annual average pace of nearly 8% in 1992-98 Most did not The core of the former Soviet Union experienced a collapse in incomespunctuated in Russia by a financial crisisBy the 2000s some economists were calling for a reconsideration of the fast-versus-slow debate In 2006 Sergio Godoy and Joseph Stiglitz argued that faster privatisations had in fact been associated with slower economic growth and that persistence in developing high-quality legal institutions paid dividends Similarly work published by Jan Svejnar in 2002 credited thorough reforms in places like Poland and Hungary for lifting growth by securing property rights and encouraging good corporate governanceWhile economists reassessed the facts on the ground changed From 1998 to 2013 all of the post-communist world enjoyed a boom Per-person annual GDP growth accelerated to 7% in the Baltic states and Ukraine 8% in Russia and 13% in Turkmenistan Russia resurgence enabled it to recapture some geopolitical stature And the robust growth of emerging markets as a whole led by China forced economists to reassess the importance of democracy and the rule of lawYet in recent years a different picture has come into focus From 2014 the long boom in commodity prices ended and the fortunes of economies which had hitched their wagons to resource exports turned From 2013 to 2019 GDP per person in Turkmenistan shrank while growth in Russia and Kazakhstan decelerated sharply As economies stalled living standards stagnated and corruption and inequality became harder to ignore Frustrations exploded onto city streets in Kazakhstan in JanuaryYou don’t know how lucky you areAmong the economies which joined the EU in contrast growth remained strong In 2016 GDP per person in Romania overtook that in Russia While much of the former Soviet Union remained dependent on exports of grain gas and gold central Europe and the Baltics became deeply integrated with European labour and financial markets and tied into European supply chains Sailing has not been entirely smooth; over the past decade populist governments in Poland and Hungary have weakened democratic institutions But such systems remain miles away from the authoritarian regimes common across most of the post-Soviet worldThese divergent experiences raise difficult questions: did the quality of institutional reform determine the economic and political avenues available for example or did other factorslike natural-resource endowments or the prospect of closer ties with the EUaffect how robust reforms were? Certainly the literature on transitional economies suggests that countries faced different internal constraints as they reformed An analysis of Russia experience in 1993 by Maxim Boycko Andrei Schleifer and Robert Vishny reckoned that the country privatisation scheme favoured insiders because management and employees enjoyed outsized influence within the Russian parliament without whose support privatisation could not proceed to take one exampleAnd yet external forces do influence internal politics Western Europe attractions surely shaped decisions taken in Warsaw and Budapest and continue to in places such as Belgrade Tiranaand Kyiv The lure of close ties with the rich West can be a powerful inducement to reform and a spur to growth and democratisation: a fact Mr Putin seems to recognise all too well Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:China may soon become a high-income country Feb 5thEconomists are revising their views on robots and jobs Jan 22ndWill remote work stick after the pandemic?

You want a financial system that can absorb corrections”The last big correction in March 2020 was a weird one Caused by an exogenous shockthe pandemicit was easy for policymakers to justify intervention The last crash caused by endogenous financial risks was that of the global financial crisis Since then the financial system has undergone a period of unusually rapid technological and regulatory change which has fundamentally altered its structure It is hard to know how a correction would rattle through this new systemThe financial landscape has been altered in three main areas: who owns financial assets; which firms intermediate markets; and how transactions are settledStart with the owners of assets A smaller share of these is now held on bank balance-sheets In 2010 just after the crisis banks held $115trn-worth of global financial assets Other kinds of financial institutions such as pension funds insurers and alternative asset managers held roughly the same amount But non-banks’ slice has swollen far more quickly since By the end of 2020 they held $227trn 26% more than the banks did The share of American mortgages that originated in banks many of which they held on to was around 80% before the financial crisis Today around half originate outside the banking system and most of these are sold on to investorsA post-banking worldThe composition of non-banks has also changed In the past most individual investors held their financial assets indirectly through pension funds In the early 1990s around a quarter of the wealth of American households came from claims on defined-benefit pensions and just 10% was in equities directly Today households hold 27% of their wealth directly in stocks the highest-ever share Just 15% comes from pension claimsIt was a lot harder for those individuals to move in and out of investments before the financial crisis than it is today Thanks to the rise of low-cost retail brokerages it is now trivially easy for people to buy or sell stocks or bond funds on a smartphone The ease with which the little guy can trade has made it far easier for there to be a run on the investment industry And the investment industry does not have the same backstop that banks enjoy through deposit insurance and central-bank supportNext consider the intermediaries Bank trading desks have long been outcompeted by specialist high-frequency trading firms like Citadel Securities with whizzy algorithms which automatically match buy and sell orders But increasingly over the past decade there has also been a retreat from bank intermediation of Treasury and corporate bonds owing to both technological and regulatory changes including new rules that deter banks from holding trading assetsBroker-dealers’ gross inventory positions of Treasury securities fell from 10% of outstanding bonds in 2008 to just 3% in 2019 The share of corporate bonds held by dealers has fallen even further to less than 1% down from 8% in 2007 This hampers their ability to act as middlemen in markets in times of trouble It can also amplify the impact of the failure of a fund “Twenty-five years ago if a bank had a client that could not make a margin call the bank could bid [buy] that position itself and absorb it on its balance-sheet But now banks don’t have that balance-sheet So they just hang out a For Sale sign and everybody sees it and it just drives the market down further” says Robert Koenigsberger of Gramercy Funds Management an asset-managerAt the same time as capacity to intermediate has dropped the supply of bonds has grown in part driven by a deluge of government supply and in part because corporate borrowers rely more on debt issuance than bank loans And the demand to trade bonds has been fuelled by the growth in exchange-traded funds ETFs built by the likes of BlackRock the world largest asset managerIt used to be hard to buy bonds in small increments Now thanks to ETFs it is much easier Some of the fixed-income ETFs offered to individuals by BlackRock might have 8000 or more different bonds in them If demand for units of the fund rises or falls it begins to trade above or below the fair value of its component bonds That incentivises market-makers to intervene either creating units by buying up a portfolio of similar bonds or destroying them by selling a portfolio Much of this activity is automatedProblems can arise in times of stress ETFs trade far more frequently than their component bonds In March 2020 as volatility shook markets BlackRock biggest investment-grade corporate-bond ETF traded 90000 times a day while the top five holdings of the fund traded just 37 times Some argue that this makes bond prices more accurate But it can also reveal just how volatile prices are in times of stress and could encourage a runThe problems can be most acute with investments like emerging-market bond funds In times of stress liquidity dries up If funds need cash to meet redemptions they have to sell their most liquid assets like Treasuries instead of their emerging-market bonds These dynamics contributed to the pressure on liquidity in the Treasury markets in March 2020Stop this correction I want to get offFinally think about the settlement layers In the past banks often settled complex trades like derivative contracts or interest-rate swaps bilaterally But during the financial crisis this meant that they could only see the trades they had with each bank not the full picture Each had no idea whether there were mitigating or exacerbating trades with others Fearful their counterparts were insolvent banks stopped lending to each otherInternational regulators decided to try to fix these issues by forcing more derivatives trading through central clearing houses which settle trades between a wide range of members Positions are transparent and netted off To join a clearing house a member must post an “initial margin” in case it defaults on its trades and that margin can climb if markets move against it There are now a handful of major clearing houses worldwide including LCH in London which clears most interest-rate swaps; ICE in Atlanta which settles credit default swaps; and the DTCC in New York which clears and settles American sharesIn sum these changes have reduced the role of banks: they own and intermediate less than ever before while settlement is now carried out by centralised institutions In many ways this seems like an improvement over the old system in which banks whose failure could rock entire economies were highly leveraged and exposed to swings in asset values But it comes with its own potential perilsOne risk is that although leverage has fallen in banks it has grown in some non-banks from insurers to hedge funds A stark illustration of this was the blow-up of Archegos Capital Management a previously low-profile family office in March 2021 The case also showed that banks can remain dangerously exposed even when it is non-banks taking the craziest risks Archegos collapse caused banksmostly those that had served it as prime brokersmore than $10bn of lossesHow might this high-tech bank-light financial system fare under severe stress? Some insight can be drawn from recent mishaps In 2019 as the Fed cut its holdings of Treasury bonds interest rates in the overnight repurchase market where banks and investors swap Treasuries for cash spiked as high as 10% In March 2020 the Treasury market went into spasms when a flood of sellers spooked by illiquidity elsewhere and desperate for cash all tried to offload bonds at once Market-watchers like Mohamed El-Erian an adviser at Gramercy think the short-squeeze in GameStop wiped as much as 5% off the S&P 500 as hedge funds with open short positions were forced to deleverage their portfoliosIn the first two cases the Fed ultimately saved the day by buying assets and creating liquidity During the GameStop saga the clearing system imposed such high capital calls on Robinhood and other brokerages that they were forced to suspend trading halting the squeeze Had it been allowed to continue it could conceivably have bankrupted enough funds and caused them to fail to deliver enough GameStop shares that the retail brokerages would have been forced to buy the required shares at any price That could have caused them to go bust tooIt is possible to imagine such an event causing havoc Instead of retail traders and other investors buying the dip as has been their habit markets continue to slide Moves are big and wild because market-making capacity is reduced Margin calls go out to a slew of hedge funds some of which fail to meet them because they are more leveraged than anyone anticipated Bond and equity funds suffer overwhelming outflows To meet redemptions managers sell their most liquid assets like Treasuries or blue-chip stocks causing yields to jump and equities to fall further Retail investors use their brokerage apps to bale out of their investments tooEven if this does not trouble the banks much such an event could upset the wider economy “Ownership has widened significantly” says Mr El-Erian “That is a good thing long-term but in the short term it might amplify household financial insecurity People with less income and less of a wealth buffer now have a greater proportion of wealth subject to volatility”In some ways this would mark a return to form In the 1990s people would go out shopping on the back of wiggles in the Nasdaq because they felt suddenly richer That connection seems to have returned especially for moves in cryptocurrencies and popular stocksIn extremis volatile markets could prompt bankruptcies of enough leveraged investors or funds to wipe out a member of a clearing houseperhaps a smaller weaker bank or insurance fundwhich might in turn wipe out the clearing house default fund This would send margin calls around all of the banks If they weakened by the same defaults that felled the other member failed to meet these the clearing house itself could be jeopardised Paul Tucker a former deputy governor of the Bank of England has written that a clearing house that could not withstand a member default could be a “devastating mechanism for transmitting distress across the financial system”Both pedals at onceThis scenario is speculative fiction At some point central bankers would step in The advantage of market-based finance is that intervening by buying assets is often enough to quell dysfunction But it is harder for central bankers to intervene if their financial-stability objectives and inflation mandates are pulling them in different directions as they would be at present with inflation well above target in many advanced economies “You’d be sort of stepping on the brake while trying to keep one foot on the accelerator” says Sir Jon “It not impossible but it could be difficult”The big vulnerability of the new financial system is that chaos can be self-fulfilling: more participants are exposed to market swings and those swings have become potentially more violent The banks themselves are certainly much more resilient than they were before the global financial crisis Yet it is difficult to know whether the high-tech market-based financial system that has been created is sturdier than the more bank-based system of 15 years ago Those still in for the ride may not have to wait long to find out

Don’t be too sure A lot of venture capital has been raised from investors Around $750bn was committed waiting to be deployed at the end of 2021 The most gilded startups might be hard pushed to notice any shift Their big funding cheques are likely to keep coming In the rest of the startup market any mark-down to more sober valuations will happen with a delay For now at least the wall of venture money militates against a big resetThe world of VC has changed a lot in the past decade or two It used to be a cottage industry based around San Francisco But as interest rates slumped other kinds of investors were pushed into taking VC risk to generate sufficient returns The lower interest rates are the less investors care about whether they receive a dollar today or a dollar tomorrow It is a perfect climate for funding startups whose pay-off may be years away The cottage industry soon faced competition from private-equity and hedge funds especially in the funding of mature “late-stage” startups These “macro” investors look at a portfolio of pre- IPO firms much like a portfolio of listed stocks says Ajay Royan of Mithril a VC firm based in Austin Texas Their instinct now is to write smaller cheques for startups to reflect the heightened risks to IPO pricingBut competition from rivals makes this harder than it sounds A VC firm that tries to align a funding round with the prices paid in public markets may find that another VC firm comes over the top with a better offer Venture capitalists are caught between two opposing forces On the one hand they see that interest rates are going up and technology stocks are falling On the other hand there is an array of tempting startups that are also being chased by lots of rival shopsThe expectations of entrepreneurs matter in this regard Many will look to the terms their startup peers achieved recently as a guide to their market value says Simon Levene of Mosaic Ventures a London-based VC firm It is not healthy for startup founders to think that capital will always be forthcoming But try telling them that An excess of optimism is part and parcel of being an entrepreneur People who are more mindful of risks get regular jobs Memories do not reliably stretch back to the dog days of 2002 when VC funding was hard to come by Founders grew up in a world of near-free money It will take time for them to adjust to a different landscapeA deeper fall in tech stocks might nudge that adjustment along But a true reset would require something else to happen Were VCs themselves unable to raise capital for new funds they would surely be forced to be less generous in the prices they paid If you can’t raise money and you know your peers can’t raise it either you become more sparing with capital Discipline becomes a watchword Valuation matters moreThis could happen But it would probably take a much bigger fall in the overall stockmarket to spur it The share of portfolios allocated to VC would then have to fall in line with diminished public stockholdings Subscriptions to new funds would dry upBut there is not much sign of this Big new funds are still being raised even after the repricing of listed tech stocks VC does not yet seem to have lost any of its sheen with pension funds endowments and family offices As long as the money flows in it will be deployed The reset may have to wait a whileRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why stockmarket jitters have not so far spread to the credit market Feb 5thWhy the bias for debt over equity is hard to dislodge Jan 22ndThe faster metabolism of finance as seen by a veteran broker Jan 15thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Feb 5th 2022,The global interest bill is about to jump,NEVER BEFORE has the world economy been so indebted The stock of global debt has gone from $83trn in 2000 to around $295trn in 2021a rate nearly double the pace of world GDP growth Debt rose from 230% of GDP in 2000 to 320% on the eve of the pandemic before covid-19 propelled it to the even greater height of 355% last yearListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPart of the reason for this explosion has been the steady decline in borrowing costs over the past two decades In early 2000 a ten-year Treasury offered a yield of 65% Today it pays 18% The Federal Reserve effective policy rate has fallen from 65% to around 008% in that time Benchmark rates in the euro area and Japan are sub-zero Declines in government-bond yields and central banks’ policy rates have fed through to loan rates for private borrowersAs a result even though global debt has rocketed over the years the world interest costs as a share of GDP are well below their peak in the 1980s In America for instance they stood at 12% of GDP in 2021 compared with 27% in 1989All this could soon change The era of super-cheap money is ending Central banks are battling a surge in inflation Those in some emerging economies have been raising interest rates for some time already: Brazil central bank raised rates by 15 percentage points after a meeting on February 2nd its third consecutive such increase At the time of writing the Bank of England was expected to deliver its second interest-rate rise The central bank with the most influence on global capital flowsthe Fedhas signalled that it will probably put rates up as soon as March and investors expect four further quarter-percentage-point increases this year Real borrowing costs for governments though still negative in many places are inching up In America the yield on the five-year Treasury inflation-protected security TIPS which hovered around -17% for much of 2021 now stands at -12%The scale of the global interest bill is vast The Economist estimates that households companies financial firms and governments worldwide paid $102trn in interest in 2021 equivalent to 12% of GDP As a guide to the potential impact of rate rises to come we consider a scenario where the interest rates faced by firms households and governments in 58 countries rise by a percentage point over the next three years By way of comparison the five-year Treasury yield has risen by a percentage point since spring 2021Our calculations suggest that the global interest bill would exceed $16trn by 2026 equivalent to 15% of projected GDP in that year And if rates were to rise twice as quickly say because inflation persists and forces central banks to take drastic action the interest bill could rise to about $20trn by 2026 nearly a fifth of global GDPWorking out the effect of rate rises on the interest bill is not straightforward Some debt is tied to a fixed interest rate such that higher borrowing costs are passed through only when it is rolled over The median maturity of government debt for instance is five years Companies tend to borrow for a two-year term; households typically borrow over a longer period Incomes change over time affecting borrowers’ ability to afford debt paymentsBorrowers could respond to higher interest costs by paying off debt so lowering their debt-interest costs But in aggregate according to research by the Bank for International Settlements BIS a club of central banks higher rates raise total debt payments ie including interest and principal relative to income The higher the level of debt the greater the squeeze suggesting that the economy has only become more sensitive to rate risesOur calculations assume that interest-rate rises feed through over the course of five years to government and household debt and over two years to company borrowing We also assume that nominal incomes rise in line with the IMF forecasts As the fund projections assume that public debt rises at broadly similar rates we let debt-to-GDP ratios stay flat This implies annual budget deficits of around 5% of GDPnarrower than in the years immediately preceding the pandemicPicking up the tabA higher interest burden would not fall on all borrowers equally Private-sector borrowers in a country tend to foot a much bigger share of the bill than the government which can borrow more cheaply for instance Financial firms and savers such as wealthier households receive as well as pay interest The more exposed the borrower is to rate rises in terms of higher debt levels the bigger the interest bill they face and the more likely it becomes that they cut back spending in order to meet their higher debt costs or in more extreme cases that they fall into distress That would in turn weigh on economic activityTo see which borrowers may be more sensitive to interest-rate rises we rank the household corporate and government sectors for our countries along two dimensions for this exercise we exclude the financial sector which intermediates lending The first measure is the debt-to-income ratio which gauges the extent to which debt is affordable The second is the change in the ratio over the past decade which captures the extent to which exposure to interest rates has increased over time We then produce an overall ranking for each sector in each country see chartStart with governments Lebanon which already defaulted on some of its debt at the start of the pandemic tops the list with a high debt-to-revenue ratio that has rocketed over the past decade Despite being a big exporter of oil Nigeria government revenues only just cover its interest costs Fortunately most borrowing by emerging-market governments during the pandemic has been in their own currencies notes Emre Tiftik of the Institute of International Finance a bankers’ group which may make them less exposed to flighty foreign capitalOur next set of borrowers comprises households Those in South Korea Norway and Switzerland have the most debt relative to their income in our group of countries Mortgage debt in Sweden is also sizeable House prices rose by 11% in 2021 and well over half of mortgage lending is done with variable interest rates When rates rise therefore mortgage bills follow suit Debt-to-income ratios have more than doubled in China and RussiaCompanies are the third set of borrowers Those in France and Switzerland have the most debt as a share of gross operating profit leaving them exposed to rate rises Among emerging markets Chinese and Russian firms are also weighed down by their bills Overall our findings for the private sector are broadly consistent with an early indicator of financial stress the credit-to-GDP gap calculated by the BIS which measures the degree to which borrowing exceeds its long-run trend On this measure the Swiss and South Korean private sectors rank among the five most stretched in the worldOur rankings help illustrate who is most exposed to rising interest rates But they cannot predict which sectors or economies will experience trouble as interest rates rise That is a far more complex picture which depends among other things on the prospects for economic growth and the reaction of policymakers Strains in one part of the economy could interact with those in others say by weakening the banking systemAlthough households in rich countries are highly indebted the interest rates they face are low in historical terms Debt levels in Argentina by contrast may not look particularly high but eye-watering interest rates of 35% for the private sector mean that borrowers are experiencing an intense squeeze Poor countries with gloomy growth prospects may struggle Rapid rate rises in America could hamper their recoveries says Gene Frieda of PIMCO a bond-fund manager Incomes may not rise fast enough to meet interest costsChina faces a combination of threats: the property market has deflated as Evergrande a large and heavily indebted developer unravels Banks have become saddled with bad household debts But the country policymakers have also responded to these risks The resulting drag on economic growth probably helps explain why the People Bank of China is lowering interest rates not raising themPolicymakers in the rest of the world may be starting to move in the opposite direction but the potential of highly indebted borrowers to drag down the economic recovery will nonetheless be weighing on their minds Correction February 2nd: The figure for the total interest bill has been corrected from $105trn to $102trn equivalent to 12% of GDP We have also edited the text in places to clarify that our ranking shows the exposure of various borrowers to interest-rate rises rather than vulnerability Sorry For more

 Feb 5th 2022,China may soon become a high-income country,CHINA IS HAUNTED by the spectre of the “middle-income trap” the notion that emerging economies grow quickly out of poverty only to get stuck before they get rich “During the next five years we must take particular care to avoid falling into the middle-income trap” said Li Keqiang China prime minister in 2016 Lou Jiwei then China finance minister once put the odds of China becoming ensnared at 50%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe trap was named by Homi Kharas and Indermit Gill two economists in 2006 when they were both at the World Bank It raises an obvious question: what counts as middle income and what would qualify as surpassing it? Mr Kharas and Mr Gill adopted the bank own income classifications These were established in 1989 when the bank drew a line separating high-income countries from the rest The line had to accommodate all of the countries that were then considered “industrial market economies” It was drawn at a national income per person of $6000 in the prices prevailing in 1987 just low enough to include Ireland and Spain That line is now $12695 It rises in step with a weighted average of prices and exchange rates in five big economies: America Britain China the euro area and Japan Eighty countries met that threshold in 2020 three fewer than the year before The pandemic relegated Mauritius Panama and Romania to the middle divisionDespite its leaders’ fears or perhaps because of them China is now on the cusp of becoming a high-income country by this definition see chart Based on the latest available forecasts from Goldman Sachs we calculate that China could cross the line next year helped in part by its strong currency The transition would not be officially announced until mid-2024 when the World Bank updates its classifications based on the previous year data If we are right then 2022 the year of the tiger could be China last as a middle-income country It will be a fatter cat thereafterThe threshold of course is arbitrary Several countries including Argentina Russia and even Venezuela have surpassed it only to flounder or fail in subsequent years A lasting escape from the middle-income trap requires a more fundamental transition Countries at this intermediate stage of development can encounter a variety of pitfalls They may face diminishing returns to capital They typically run out of workers to move out of agriculture And they must invest heavily in education beyond the basic schooling a factory hand needs to follow instructions The truer test of a high-income country is how well it copes with such threats to its growth How is China faring on these three counts?China is still accumulating capital at a furious pace It invested 43% of its GDP in the five years before the pandemic The high-income countries averaged only half that percentage But China high investment rate is perhaps not as fruitless as is often assumed Just as its investment remains high by the standards of rich countries so does its GDP growth rate Indeed the ratio between its investment share in output and its growth rate sometimes called the incremental capital-output ratio or ICOR still looks favourable in comparison with high-income countriesWhat about other sources of growth? In its annual check-up of China economy released on January 28th the IMF noted with concern that China “total factor productivity” growth which measures changes in output that cannot be attributed to more capital or labour fell in the past decade compared with the ten years before It attributed this slackening to “a stalling” of structural reforms especially of state-owned enterprises “Market dynamism has been losing steam recently” it argued But this kind of productivity is notoriously hard to measure And according to one gauge from the Conference Board a business group it is rising notably faster in China than in high-income countries see chartChina employment patterns still differ markedly from those of more prosperous countries Surprisingly perhaps the share of its workforce in construction is lower than the high-income average The percentage in manufacturing is higher 19% compared with an average of 13% and the share still in agriculture is far higherabout 25% compared with a high-income average of 3% From one perspective this residual rural workforce is a reason for optimism If China can achieve high-income levels with a quarter of its workers marooned in agriculture imagine what it will do as they escape into more productive employment? The worry however is that these workers have not left the farms because they cannot Perhaps they do not want to forfeit their claims on communal land Or perhaps they are too old or poorly educated to take advantage of better opportunities in citiesChina stock of human capital is indeed a cause for concern According to its latest census its adult population had an average of 99 years of schooling in 2020 That would put it near the bottom of the heap of high-income countries which have 115 years on average according to Robert Barro of Harvard and Jong-Wha Lee of Korea UniversityThe high-income trapThis problem can only be fixed one cohort at a time China older citizens grew up in a much poorer country and were educated accordingly A child now entering China school system could expect to receive 131 years of education according to the World Bank The quality does not yet match the quantity: based on how well children score on standardised tests 13 years of school in China is equivalent to less than ten years in a country like Singapore the bank calculates Nevertheless things have improvedThe “stock” of human capital reflects China impoverished past then but the “flow” of investment in new human capital is more befitting of a high-income future The problem is that this costly investment of money and time is deterring parents from having children a demographic deadlock that is sadly characteristic of many rich parts of the world China population increased last year by only 003% Judging by Japan experience an ageing declining population can contribute to depressed spending low growth and low interest rates China policymakers must now worry about a different kind of trap Read more from Free Exchange or column on economics:Quantitative tightening is no substitue for higher interest rates Jan 29thEconomists are revising their views on robots and jobs Jan 22ndWill remote work stick after the pandemic?

downturn has been drastically different In America private non-residential investment is only about 5% below its pre-pandemic trend compared with a shortfall of nearly 25% in mid-2010 the equivalent point in the previous economic cycle see chart The country has enjoyed the fastest rebound in business investment in any recovery since the 1940s according to Morgan Stanley a bank In the rich world as a whole predicts the World Bank total investment will have overtaken its pre-pandemic trend by 2023Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe lacklustre investment of the 2010s was largely blamed on slow output growth and dismal prospects for the economy By contrast the vibrant recovery this time is part of a V-shaped rebound encompassing growth employment andless happilyinflation It helps too that investment fell less steeply than it did in 2008-09 even as GDP sank at rates not seen since the Depression Economies shrank in spring 2020 mainly because consumption disappeared as people stayed homeYet the investment rebound is not purely a cyclical bounceback The changes wrought by the pandemic have necessitated more investment too The extent to which such investment continues will depend on whether those changes endure One feature of the pandemic for instance has been soaring demand for everything digital As a result investment in computers in America is 17% above its pre-covid trend Roughly a year ago the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation announced that it would spend $100bn over three years to expand its chipmaking output In mid-January 2022 it upped the stakes saying it would spend $40bn-44bn this year alone Days later Intel another chipmaker said it would invest more than $20bn in two factories in OhioBlockages in the global supply chain for goods have also led to a splurge on new capacity In 2021 shipping companies ordered the equivalent of 42m twenty-foot containersa record according to Drewry a consultancy Perhaps the archetypal business investment of the pandemic is being made by logistics companies testing whether autonomous cranes can increase throughput at ports and rail terminalsAs the heat of crisis has passed the pace of the investment rebound has subsided a little A composite indicator built by JPMorgan Chase a bank suggests that global capital spending rose at a underwhelming rate of 22% in the fourth quarter of 2021 Economists have recently marked down their forecasts for global GDP growth in 2022 owing to the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus and the prospect of tighter monetary policy both of which might weigh on bosses’ willingness to splash out on risky projectsThere are however three reasons why business investment might be stronger in the 2020s than it was in the 2010s The first is that companies are likely to keep spending on their supply chains as they seek to strengthen and diversify them During the pandemic many have discovered the inconvenience of distant suppliers shutting down when lockdowns or staff shortages strike: factory closures in Vietnam last year for instance imperilled America supply of tennis shoes and yoga pants Firms must also cope with increasingly fraught geopolitics which increases the chances of tariffs on trade and state meddling This may not be good news for economic growth because fragmentation means duplication and inefficiency But it does mean tying up more capitalThe second reason to expect more investment is the growing optimism about the potential of new technologies to boost productivity growth Not long ago economists fretted that the world was running out of useful ideas Yet firms are increasingly betting on technological progress Intellectual property now makes up 41% of America private non-residential investment compared with 36% before the pandemic and 29% in 2005 In 2021 the big five technology firmsAlphabet Amazon Apple Meta and Microsoftalone spent $149bn on R&DImpressive technological advances are everywhere from synthetic biology and the “messenger RNA” vaccines with which the world is battling covid-19 to areas such as virtual reality and decentralised finance The advances in some frontier fields are headline-grabbing In December Synchron a medical-technology firm revealed that a man with one of its chips implanted next to his brain motor cortex had sent a tweet just by thinking it In January surgeons announced that they had successfully implanted a pig heart into a man for the first timeThe third force driving investment higher is decarbonisation A number of countries together making up 90% of the world economy have pledged to reduce carbon emissions to net zero over the coming decades in order to fight climate change If that goal is to be achieved the world will need everything from electric-vehicle charging infrastructure to battery storage and energy-efficient housingPunters are pouring money into green-tinged investment funds the assets of which amounted to $27trn in the fourth quarter of 2021 according to Morningstar a data provider Global investment spending on the transition away from fossil fuels reached $755bn last year about half of which was spent on renewable energy according to BloombergNEF a research firm Spending on electric vehicles has risen particularly quickly by 77% since 2020 to $273bn helped along by rapidly shifting consumer preferences and big orders from delivery and car-rental companiesIf net-zero targets are to be met however then the green-investment boom still has a long way to run The Office for Budget Responsibility Britain fiscal watchdog estimates that achieving the country target by 2050 requires investment worth about 60% of its GDP today three-quarters of which would have to be stumped up by the private sector If that share were to apply across the rest of the rich world too then its need for private-sector green investment would exceed $20trn at present values Other estimates of what is needed are higher stillAn investment boom is hardly nailed on The mass upheaval of supply chains is still a subject that is more often talked about than seen in the statistics There were plenty of notable advances in the previous economic recovery which began only two years after the launch of the first iPhone in 2007 Yet investment remained tepid perhaps because many new technologies seem not to need much capital Net-zero targets could always be missedBut the pay-offs to R&D investment at least may be rising In a recent research note Yulia Zhestkova of Goldman Sachs another bank found that in America between 2016 and 2019 there was a positive correlation between an industry investment in intellectual property and its labour-productivity growth It would not take much of a productivity revival to significantly boost the outlook for growth which is being weighed down by population ageing So-called total factor productivity growth which measures increases in GDP that cannot be attributed to more capital or hours worked averaged 12% a year between 1880 and 2020 notes Ms Zhestkova By contrast the figure was only about 05% in the 2010s Simply returning to the historical average would create the prospect of a larger economy in the future giving firms yet another reason to invest For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter And for more

 Feb 4th 2022,Why stockmarket jitters have not so far spread to the credit market,WRITING IN JULY 2007 the fund manager and bubble spotter Jeremy Grantham likened the stockmarket to a brontosaurus Although credit markets were collapsing around him share prices remained stubbornly high It was as if the great sauropod had been bitten on the tail but the message was still “proceeding up the long backbone one vertebra at a time” towards its tiny brain It took its time arriving: America S&P 500 index did not reach its nadir for another 20 monthsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe story so far this year has been different Equities particularly the more speculative ones have had a brutal start to 2022 The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell by about 16% in January before rallying a little The ARK Innovation fund a vehicle devoted to young high-risk tech stocks declined by 20% last month and is 53% below its peak in early 2021 Yet even the wilder parts of the credit markets remain comparatively serene Bank of America US high-yield index a popular barometer for the price of “junk” bonds issued by the least credit worthy borrowers has fallen by just 24% since late DecemberThe contrast is less surprising than you might think The value of a stock stems from a stream of potential earnings extending far into the future By contrast the value of a bond depends on the issuer ability to pay interest until the security matures and then to find the cash to repay the principal probably by issuing another bond That makes bondholders less starry-eyed than shareholders If a firm wants to change the world greatbut avoiding going broke for a few years is fine too So bond markets tend to be less susceptible to swings in sentiment and price In other words 2007 was the exception not the ruleMoreover the creditworthiness of junk bonds as a category improved during the pandemic The difficulties of 2020 hastened the descent of “fallen angels”: companies such as Kraft Heinz that were previously rated investment-grade but were then downgraded Such issuers tend to sit at the safest end of the junk marketNonetheless there are good reasons for investors to be watchful One is that the shock of monetary-policy tightening could be yet to feed through The record amount of junk bonds that were issued over the past two years will eventually need refinancing For American firms such issuance amounted to $869bn or around half of the outstanding stock of junk bonds according to Refinitiv a data provider Ensuring that firms did not flounder for lack of credit was a key aim of the Federal Reserve pandemic-prompted bond-buying But its asset purchases are soon to end Borrowers will have to either repay the debt or refinance it in a market that is no longer flooded with liquidityMore fundamentally the investment case for high-yield debt has changed as interest rates have declined Michael Milken an American investment banker pioneered the use of junk bonds in the 1980s by arguing that their yields were high enough to compensate investors for the odd default In that decade he was right: junk yields averaged 145% and just 22% of issuers defaulted each year But the phrase “high-yield” has since lost its meaning Although central-bank rate rises are on the cards yields are still anaemic In America and Europe average junk-bond yields of 51% and 33% respectively are well below inflation The credit market resilience amounts to a belief that few of even the riskiest borrowers are likely to go bankrupt Yet when the yield is in the low single figures it takes only a handful of defaults to break the investment caseAnd borrowers that do default are likely to be in worse financial health leaving creditors nursing heavier losses Lender protections have weakened over the past decade as yield-starved investors chased returns at any cost Maintenance covenants which allow lenders to seize the wheel if the borrower financial position deteriorates have long been absent from bonds and have largely disappeared from private loans too Incurrence covenants which limit borrowers’ ability to issue new debt or pay dividends have lost their teethIts proponents might point out that bond investors have few attractive alternatives to junk debt Yields on Treasuries are still low; financial markets expect the Fed benchmark rate to peak no higher than 18% But credit markets are priced for a world in which nasty surprises don’t happen and liquidity flows eternal Those assumptions increasingly look like they belong with the brontosaurusRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why the bias for debt over equity is hard to dislodge Jan 22ndThe faster metabolism of finance as seen by a veteran broker Jan 15thWhy gold has lost some of its investment allure Jan 8thFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 29th 2022,The reasons behind the stockmarket turmoil,AS THE STOCK-TRADING screens turned red one trader was heard to quip that at least some things are falling in price By the market close on Wednesday January 26th the cumulative loss on the S&P 500 index had moved towards 10% for this year barely four weeks in The year-to-date decline in the NASDAQ Composite a tech-heavy index is well into the double digits The message from the Federal Reserve which concluded its scheduled policy meeting on the 26th is that interest rates must rise soon to tackle high inflation It has been a rocky start to 2022 for investorsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe day-to-day numbers for the broad indices do not do full justice to the jumpiness of markets Much of the drama has been beneath the surface at the stock or industry level Technology shares in particular have fared badly The FTSE 100 index of British stocks which is light on technology and heavy on oil and commodity firms has been more resilient than American indices see chart 1 Prices have swung wildly during each trading day On Monday for instance trading began in New York with a big sell-off which then intensified At one point the NASDAQ was down by almost 5% Then stocks suddenly rallied The NASDAQ finished the day up by 06% On Tuesday share prices fell again On Wednesday the S&P 500 had posted a handsome increase before Jerome Powell the Fed chairman gave his press conference By the time he had finished speaking it was in the redBehind all the minute-to-minute lurches is a market that is somewhat forward-looking And what has the market now to look forward to? Quite a lot of trouble it would seem In six months’ time the easy money that has supported stock prices for so long will be firmly on the way out The economy will be weaker Corporate profits will be feeling the squeeze from decelerating revenue growth and from rising wage costs There are in short more reasons for alarm than hope No wonder markets are so jitteryStart with the Fed which is never far from investors’ thoughts After spending much of 2021 playing down any immediate need for tighter money the Fed changed its tune quite abruptly It sounded a more hawkish note at its monetary-policy meeting in December The minutes of that meeting published on January 5th made clear to investors that rates would soon be going up The reasons for the volte face are straightforward Inflation is uncomfortably high It can no longer be dismissed as transitory And the labour market is fast running out of workers Speaking on the 26th Mr Powell emphasised the risks to price stability and did not dismiss the idea of a rapid series of interest-rate increases A 025% rate rise at the Fed next meeting on March 15th-16th seems nailed-onIn response to the change in tone markets have priced in more rapid policy tightening The rise in long-term real interest rates has been notably sharp Yields on ten-year Treasury inflation-protected securities TIPS which were around -1% at the start of the year are now approaching -05% Stockmarkets have had to adjust to this Higher long-term rates reduce the present value of future corporate cashflows making shares less valuable The effect is especially marked for the shares of tech companies which are priced for profit growth long into the future Hence the violence of the NASDAQ declineThe Fed is not the only concern Much of the run-up in markets last year was predicated on a stronger economy and handsome revenues and profits Extraordinary growth in America was fuelled by low interest rates pent-up demand and a bumper $19trn fiscal-stimulus package These impulses are fading On January 25th the IMF cut its forecast for GDP growth in America by 12 percentage points to 4% for 2022 as part of its generally more sombre outlook on the world economy There are already hints that a sharper slowdown could be under way Activity in America service industries has fallen to an 18-month low according to the latest survey of purchasing managers Retail sales slumped in December Consumer confidence is low Some of this can be put down to Omicron But the fear is that it also reflects an ebbing in underlying demandAs investors consider the demand outlook for the coming months there is a lot less to excite them Profits will be squeezed by a slowing economy and thus slowing revenue but also by rising costs Higher commodity prices add to the raw-material bill A bigger headache is labour The tight jobs market is bidding up the salaries of scarce workers “There is real wage inflation everywhere” lamented David Solomon boss of Goldman Sachs on a call to investors last week His bank had just reported a blowout year for profits but the nerves of investors were jangled by the one-third increase in Goldman wage bill last year Other businesses that also rely more on brainpower than physical capital will feel the pinchanother reason why tech shares especially those of fledgling firms have come under selling pressureA third concern is valuation Stocks in America look terrifyingly expensive A measure popularised by Robert Shiller of Yale University puts America stock prices at a steep 36 times their earnings adjusted for the business cycle That is above the reading before the 1929 crash though still lower than the valuation reached during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s A reckoning had long seemed due especially for expensive-looking unproven businesses ARK Innovation an exchange-traded fund that invests in young tech firms has become shorthand for the more speculative end of the market It is down by more than 50% from its peak There is scepticism about familiar names such as Netflix and Zoom which did well from the stay-at-home economy but have suffered recently Investors are taking refuge in hitherto unloved oil stocks which offer protection against inflation such as ExxonMobil see chart 2 “In short” notes Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley a bank “the froth is coming out of an equity market that simply got too extended on valuation”Might anything improve the market mood? There are some bits of good news that investors might eventually cling to Omicron may prove to be the final wave of the pandemic; its effects may be transient As it fades so might the labour bottlenecks behind much of the recent inflation There are tentative signs that China economy is bottoming out The EU “Next Generation” fund which will disburse €750bn $880bn to member states still has a lot of fiscal fuel in the tank A lot of the better news comes from outside America though It may not do much for the NASDAQ And it is hard to feel bullish about Europe with Russian troops amassed on Ukraine borderInvestors nursing hefty losses might have hoped for a less hawkish tone from Mr Powell Instead he sounded far more worried about rising consumer prices than falling share prices A volatile stockmarket should not be of first-order concern to policymakers A market correction might even suit the Fed purposes if it brings the people who have retired early on their share-price gains back into work The Fed would have more reason to worry should the corporate-bond market become badly unstuck because it is vital for funding But so far corporate-bond spreads have been stable It is stock prices that are jumpy And it is hard to see that changing soon For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 29th 2022,Quantitative tightening is no substitute for higher interest rates,CENTRAL BANKERS almost everywhere are tightening monetary policy to fight inflation Markets expect interest rates to rise by about a percentage point in America and Britain and by a tenth of a point in the euro area over the course of the year But modern central bankers have more than one lever at their disposal Many in the rich world are preparing to put into reverse the almost $12trn of quantitative easing QE or bond-buying they have conducted during the pandemic On January 26th the Federal Reserve said it would end QE soon and gave guidance for the first time about how it might shrink its balance-sheet a process dubbed quantitative tightening QT Reversing trillions of dollars of asset purchases might seem like a powerful way to contain inflation In fact QT will be an unreliable toolListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHaving cut interest rates nearly as far as they could go during the global financial crisis of 2007-09 central banks began experimenting with QE which was a relatively new and poorly understood tool But when the time came to tighten they preferred to follow the normal path and raise interest rates rather than risk the unknown by starting QT So they maintained the size of their balance-sheets by reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds It was not until rates hit 1-125% in late 2017 that the Fed let its balance-sheet “run off” by stopping reinvestments The Bank of England in 2018 said it would start QT after rates hit 15%a threshold it never reachedThe Fed strategy seemed to work but because its bonds matured only gradually it was slow In the roughly two years for which it was in place the central bank stock of assets fell by $710bn QT this time will start from a much higher base The Fed has bought plenty more bonds during the pandemic: it now holds some $45trn more in assets than in 2019 Were the glacial pace of reduction to be repeated the next crisis would probably strike before the balance-sheet had shrunk by very muchBut the thinking has changed “The period of time between stopping purchases and beginning run-off will be shorter and… the run-off can be faster” Jerome Powell the Fed chairman said on January 11th The Bank of England plans to stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds when rates reach just 05% which may happen in February Even the European Central Bank balance-sheet is expected to shrink as it scales back emergency loans to banks forecasts Goldman Sachs a bankWhat explains the desire for a quick QT? Andrew Bailey governor of the Bank of England has warned of a “ratcheting up” of the bank presence in bond markets if it never scales back its holdings A committee of the House of Lords has accused the bank of having a “dangerous addiction” to buying bonds Most central banks also face the prospect as rates rise of paying interest on the reserves they have created in order to buy bonds via QE They would in effect be shouldering part of their governments’ debt-interest costsa role that could become uncomfortableSome central bankers also think that QT could allow them to fight inflation without raising interest rates as much as would otherwise be necessary “I would prefer a flatter funds-rate path and more adjustment on the balance-sheet” said Mary Daly president of the San Francisco Fed earlier in January The theory is that QE holds down long-term bond yields so reversing it will cause them to rise slowing the economyHowever despite the enormous size of QEand the universal agreement that it rescued markets in spring 2020the evidence that it has a sustained large effect on long-term bond yields is thin In theory the Fed bond holdings compress the term premium the component of long-term bond yields that compensates investors for locking up money for a long time But says Dario Perkins of TS Lombard a research firm the term premium does not seem to track central banks’ balance-sheets Instead it closely follows the dispersion in forecasts of inflation suggesting that it reflects inflation risk If QE does not have lasting relevance to bond yields neither should QT The ten-year Treasury yield was lower not higher by the end of the last round of QT In other words although the Fed held fewer bonds their price had risenThere is one way in which balance-sheet policy has an obvious and immediate effect: by offering a signal to investors about central bankers’ probable interest-rate decisions In a downturn bond-buying indicates that things are really bad and so interest rates will stay low for a long time; slowing or reversing QE can signal that rate rises are coming Perhaps the most famous market reaction to a balance-sheet announcement the “taper tantrum” of 2013 happened primarily because traders drew inferences about the path of short-term rates from what Ben Bernanke then the Fed chairman said about plans to slow the pace of bond-buyingIn the late 2010s central bankers tried to mute such signals It was common to refer to the Fed QT as happening “in the background” As inflation surged in 2021 however they showed less discipline Dissenters on the Bank of England monetary-policy committee voted to end QE early In recent weeks rate-setters’ speculation about QT may have helped convince traders that the Fed really is serious about tightening policy contributing to sharp falls in asset prices In its latest plan the Fed has said that interest rates are its primary policy tool But it has struggled to articulate whether or not more QT means fewer rate risesBalance and imbalancePerhaps it is good that investors have woken up to the Fed plans for rates Yet pivoting to using QT and rate rises as substitutes as Ms Daly suggests could put the signalling mechanism into reverse More QT would mean fewer rate rises not more so could cause bond yields to fall QT would have become bizarrely a source of stimulusthe last thing a central banker with an inflation problem should want Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Economists are revising their views on robots and jobs Jan 22ndWill remote work stick after the pandemic?

 Jan 29th 2022,How is Omicron affecting the global economic recovery?,LATE NOVEMBER almost began to feel like the early days of the pandemic all over again Global stockmarkets fell as news of what would come to be known as the Omicron variant filtered out and investors feared either another round of restrictions or that people would shut themselves away Two months on Omicron impact is slowly coming into focus So far it is largely better than feared Markets are skittish but because of the prospect of higher interest rates rather than covid-19 Goldman Sachs a bank has constructed a share-price index of European firms such as airlines and hotels that thrive when people are able and willing to be in public spaces The index a proxy for anxiety about the virus has surged relative to wider stockmarkets in recent weeksListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHigh-frequency economic data back up the cautious optimism Nicolas Woloszko of the OECD a rich-country think-tank produces a weekly GDP index for 46 middle- and high-income economies using data from Google-search activity on everything from housing and jobs to economic uncertainty Adapting his index which has been a good predictor of the official numbers we estimate that GDP across these countries is about 25% below its pre-pandemic trend see chart 1 That is a little worse than in November when GDP was 16% below trend but better than a year ago when output was nearly 5% below itA few factors explain why the worst fears about the variant economic effects have so far not come to pass The great uncertainty with Omicron relates to whether the bad greater transmissibility outweighs the good lower virulence and thus whether there is a damaging surge in hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19 So far though few governments apart from China which is still wedded to its zero-covid strategy seem to believe that additional drastic restrictions on people movements are requiredA quantitative measure produced by UBS a bank ranks global restrictions from zero to ten and finds that the average global score has risen from 3 to 35 in recent weeks Only one rich country the Netherlands moved into a proper lockdown though this was relaxed on January 26th UBS also finds that the share of international travel routes with covid-related entry restrictions at 31% globally has barely budged since OctoberMore people also seem happy to take risks Goldman Sachs produces an “effective” lockdown index which takes into account not only governments’ diktats but also people choices So far its global index has tightened to about the same level as during the Delta wave of last summer despite four to five times as many daily infections Even in places where the rapid spread of covid-19 is a novelty people are largely carrying on as normal Cases in San Francisco were in the low double digits for most of the autumn Although the city now averages about 2000 a day gyms and restaurants remain busy Our global “normalcy index” which looks at how people behaviour has changed relative to pre-covid norms dropped in recent weeks but now seems to be recoveringToday case numbers suggest that about 5-10% of Americans currently have covid-19 Such high prevalence has created a new difficulty that did not exist with previous variants: a widespread absence of workers According to a survey conducted at the turn of the year by the Census Bureau 88m Americans were out of work either because they were caring for someone with covid-19 or because they had the disease themselves At the end of 2021 138 National Basketball Association players were unable to work for covid-related reasons though this number has since dropped In San Francisco a small but growing number of shops which had already been struggling with a labour shortage are closing early for lack of staffMeasuring the effect of such absences on output is hard but it looks likely to be limitedand short-lived For a start several factors might offset their impact Some of the workers who are isolating will be able to toil from home If a restaurant is closed prospective diners may still have other places to visit And for a time at least co-workers who are uninfected can take up some of the slack The overall drag could therefore be modest Research published earlier this month by JPMorgan Chase another bank for instance speculated that absences could reduce Britain GDP in January by 04%Moreover with case numbers falling both in Britain and in some cities in America Omicron economic effects look likely to fade rapidly Forward-looking surveys also suggest that firms are not too worried There is little sign for instance of a decline in business confidence see chart 2Despite a better overall performance than expected the global economic recovery from the lockdowns of 2020 is still uneven The gap between the best and worst performers is as wide as it has ever been As South Africa Omicron wave has collapsed GDP has risen and is now in line with its pre-crisis trend Britain economy seems to be recovering fairly quicklyOther places are still struggling however whether because of a slow roll-out of boosters low population immunity or plain bad luck According to the OECD measure the Spanish economy is still roughly 7% smaller relative to its pre-covid trend Omicron has not done too much to knock the global economic recovery off course But some places still

 Jan 29th 2022,Has Deutsche Bank turned the corner?,WHEN IN APRIL 2018 Christian Sewing took over as chief executive of Deutsche Bank few thought he would last very long The bank one of Europe biggest by assets had been through four chief executives in six years and its very survival was at stake It was unable to make enough profits to generate anything resembling a decent return for investors and seemed to be frequently ensnared in costly litigation There was talk of the bank being taken over and even wound downListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Sewing is impressively still in his joband his contract was extended last year to 2026 On January 27th he presented the bank annual results for 2021 at Deutsche headquarters in Frankfurt They seemed to confirm that the lender has stabilised at last Mr Sewing reported a pre-tax profit of €34bn $38bn and a net profit of €25bn for 2021 In the final three months of the year it made a net profit of €315m a year-on-year increase of 67% beating analysts’ expectations Across 2021 as a whole “we delivered our best result in ten years” said Mr Sewing Shareholders seem to agree Since its record low in March 2020 Deutsche share price has almost doubledHas Deutsche turned the corner? A year after he took over Mr Sewing announced his grand plan for saving the 152-year-old bank that once financed Germany industrialisation It would be “the most fundamental transformation” of the bank in decades he promised in July 2019 He said he would shrink its investment bank and shut down the trading of shares altogether And he announced that he would cut costs by €58bn a year a quarter of the total to €17bn in 2022 Eighteen thousand jobs a fifth of the payroll would goMr Sewing restructured bank consists of four pillars The two biggest in terms of revenue are its retail arm and its investment bank After its merger in 2018 with Postbank a German postal bank Deutsche remains the country biggest retail lender The investment bank which is still substantial brought in more than a third of revenue last year a chunk of it from trading fixed-income securities currencies and commoditiesThe two other pillars are a corporate bank that provides mainly European businesses with services such as cash management and trade finance and DWS Germany biggest asset manager which is mostly owned by Deutsche and is according to analysts its most consistently profitable business“Mr Sewing has done a good job in a tough environment” says Stuart Graham an analyst at Autonomous Research who argued in a report in 2018 that Deutsche Bank business model was broken beyond repair The period when Deutsche was frequently in trouble with the law seems to have passed Credit-rating agencies such as Fitch and S&P upped many of Deutsche ratings last year arguing that its strengthened business model sound asset quality decent funding and liquidity positions as well as its adequate capitalisation inspired confidenceStill no one thinks Deutsche is out of the woods yet Last year boom in fixed-income trading was unexpected and may not last says Jon Peace of Credit Suisse a bank Deutsche needs to start bolstering capital to prepare for Basel 4 a new set of regulations that will take effect in 2025 Moreover its costs are still high compared with its peers Mr Sewing must cut them further if he is to meet his ambitious targetsThe big question is whether Mr Sewing will reach his goal of a return on tangible equity of 8% and start to pay shareholders a bounty of up to €5bn in dividends this year The bank made no payments for 2019 and 2020 and only a small one for last yearAs a result Deutsche has not persuaded shareholders that it generates enough profits to provide an adequate return The bank is therefore still trading at less than half of its book value And analysts are doubtful that Mr Sewing target can be reached Jochen Schmitt at Metzler a German bank predicts a 48% return on equity this year; the consensus forecast among analysts is 55% Deutsche may have come a long way since hitting rock-bottom Nevertheless Mr Sewing may not be able to look back with satisfaction just yet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 22nd 2022,Why bank stocks are tumbling even as interest rates climb,MUCH AS HIGHER milk prices are typically good news for dairy farmers higher interest rates are meant to be good news for bankers Conventional lenders make their money on the difference between the interest they pay out to depositors and the interest they earn on loans and investments As rates rise that gap widens And as interest rates are set by central banks that only tend to raise them when the economy is strongwhen jobs are plentiful spending is high and inflation is climbingrising rates typically also imply that borrowers will be well placed to repay their debtsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTreasury yields and interest-rate expectations in America have marched higher since the middle of December when the Federal Reserve announced it would accelerate plans to taper its asset purchases The yield on ten-year Treasuries climbed to 19% on January 18th its highest level in two years As recently as October investors expected just a solitary interest-rate increase from the Fed in 2022 But they have rapidly revised expectations as consumer-price inflation has surged pencilling in between four and five rate rises over the course of the yearSo when six of America largest banksBank of America Citigroup Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargoreported earnings for the final quarter of 2021 between January 14th and 19th their executives merrily offered guidance of greater interest income to come Jamie Dimon the boss of JPMorgan thought that market expectations of interest-rate rises could even be too conservative “My view is that there is a pretty good chance there will be more than four” he said on an earnings call on January 14th “It could be six or seven”Yet surprisingly the lenders’ stock prices have tumbled see chart Shares in JPMorgan have fallen by nearly 12% since the bank reported its earnings Goldman shares dropped by 7% in a single day on January 18th after it released its earnings What resolves this seeming paradox?The first potential explanation is costs and climbing wage bills in particular Compensation costs at Goldman in 2021 jumped by 33% year on year to $177bn an increase of $44bn Citi wage bill spiked by 33% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier and compensation expenses rose by 14% at JPMorgan and 10% at Bank of America over the same periodHigher wage costs in part reflect booming business: Goldman profits for 2021 as a whole were more than 60% above their previous all-time high But dearer compensation adds to growing unease about how pervasively inflation has taken root in America “There is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy” David Solomon Goldman boss told investors on the bank earnings callAn alternative explanation for the share-price fall is that investors are fearful that higher rates are not unequivocally good news for America banks The flood of cheap money pumped by the Fed into financial markets in 2020 and 2021 helped asset prices reach dizzying new heights Goldman made $22bn from trading in 2021 the most since 2008Easy money also helped fuel a bonanza in company-financing activity The pace of dealmaking and initial public offerings IPOs has been almost bewildering Global IPOs raised the mammoth sum of $600bn in capital in 2021 compared with around $200bn in 2019 Trading and corporate finance have together generated extraordinary profits for Wall Street firms Global investment-banking revenues amounted to $129bn in 2021 a 40% increase over those of the year before according to Dealogic a data providerBut now as inflation hots up and monetary policy shifts the period of bumper profits that banks enjoyed since the middle of 2020 may be coming to an end A look at the profits for the final three months of 2021 suggests that the slowdown may have already begun Trading revenues dropped by 11% at JPMorgan compared with the same period a year earlier although revenues were still 6% above their level in 2019Considering that bank bosses have been warning for months that trading and dealmaking revenues would eventually return to pre-pandemic levels their imminent normalisation should perhaps have not come as a surprise to investors The fact that share prices have fallen then could hint at a lurking fear The arrival of extraordinary stimulus prompted an unusual period of profitability for bankers Perhaps punters are worried that the removal of such stimulus could prove unusually dismal For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 22nd 2022,America labour shortages have done little to boost perks for workers,THE PANDEMIC has fundamentally transformed the American workplace More people than ever are working from home Meetings have moved from offices to screens Employees are quitting their jobs in droves pushing job vacancies to record highs Amid widespread labour shortages firms are handing out pay rises and bonuses to attract workers But what about other perks which make up a big chunk of employees’ overall compensation? If you listen to bosses firms have expanded benefit plans in the wake of the pandemic providing workers with more flexible hours emergency sick leave and mental-health services But official statistics show only modest gains in fringe benefits since the start of the pandemic Although the value of non-wage compensation for low-paid workers grew faster than that for better-paid employees last year the disparity in the level of provision remains vastListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHealth insurance paid leave pensions and other “fringe” benefits doled out by private-sector firms accounted for 29% of total compensation on average in 2021 up from 20% in 1970 according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics BLS If perks such as free food were to be included the figure would be higher still Although they are harder to measure amenities such as flexible working hours are valuable too A paper published in 2018 by researchers at Harvard Medical School the University of California Los Angeles and the RAND Corporation analysed survey data and concluded that the freedom to set one own schedule is worth a pay increase of 9% and the ability to work from home is worth a raise of 41%But such benefits much like wages tend to be unevenly distributed Some 94% of private-sector workers in the top quartile of the income distribution have access to health insurance from their employer compared with just 40% of workers in the bottom quartile according to the BLS Similar disparities exist for life insurance 84% v 25% retirement benefits 90% v 44% and paid sick leave 94% v 52% Differences in working conditions make things even more lopsided according to new research by Jason Sockin of the University of Pennsylvania Using data from Glassdoor a website that lets users post anonymous reviews of their employers Mr Sockin finds that high-paying firms tend to offer better amenities thereby exacerbating labour-market inequalityEfforts to improve benefits during the pandemic appear to have done little to expand provision to more workers The latest national compensation survey by the BLS found that access to paid sick and family leave at private firms rose on average by only four and five percentage points respectively between March 2019 and March 2021 Flexible working hours defined as the freedom to set your own schedule expanded by just three percentage points Peter Cappelli of the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School says that although some companies have introduced signing bonuses and free university tuition to attract workers they have been reluctant to shell out for pricier perks “I think they really are resisting moving towards benefits that are going to cost them much of anything” Mr Cappelli saysAlthough access to benefits has changed little perks are at least becoming more generous for some recipients Every year the BLS tots up the value of employees’ compensation costs In 2021 workers in the bottom tenth enjoyed a 92% increase in the real value of benefits on average the biggest rise since data were first collected in 2009 In the 12 months ending in September 2021 average benefit costs for service-sector workers including cooks carers and cleaners rose by 33% compared with 26% across the workforce as a wholeThe hope is that such increases continue if labour remains scarce Mr Sockin says that employees may also be taking stock: “I think the pandemic has led to this recognition among workers that they may want more than just a wage” But with the value of benefits amounting to less than $3 per hour worked for someone in the bottom tenth of the income distribution compared with $25 for someone in the top 10% the gap that needs closing is truly vast For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 22nd 2022,The race to dominate the DeFi ecosystem is on,TO BELIEVERS OPEN public blockchains provide a second chance at building a digital economy The fact that the applications built on top of such blockchains all work with each other and that the information they store is visible to all harks back to the idealism of the internet early architects before most users embraced the walled gardens offered by the tech giants The idea that a new kind of “decentralised” digital economy might be possible has been bolstered over the past year as the numerous applications being built on top of various blockchains have boomed in size and functionalityListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPerhaps the most significant part of that economy has been decentralised-finance DeFi applications which enable users to trade assets get loans and store deposits Now an intensifying battle for market share is breaking out in this area Crucially Ethereum the leading DeFi platform seems to be losing its near-monopoly The struggle shows how DeFi is subject to the standards wars that have broken out in other emerging technologiesthink of Sony Betamax versus VHS video cassettes in the 1970sand illustrates how DeFi technology is improving lightning-fastThe idea behind DeFi is that blockchainsdatabases distributed over many computers and kept secure by cryptographycan help replace centralised intermediaries like banks and tech platforms The value of assets stored in this nascent financial system has climbed from less than $1bn at the start of 2020 to more than $200bn today see chartUntil recently the Ethereum blockchain was the undisputed host of all this activity It was created in 2015 as a more general-purpose version of Bitcoin Bitcoin database stores information about transactions in the associated cryptocurrency providing proof of who owns what at any time Ethereum stores more information such as lines of computer code An application that can be programmed in code can be guaranteed to operate as written thereby removing the need for an intermediary But just as Ethereum improved upon Bitcoin it too is now being usurped by newer better technology The fight resembles competition between operating systems for computers says Jeremy Allaire the boss of Circle a firm that issues USD Coin a popular crypto-tokenCurrent blockchain technology is clunky Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use a mechanism called “proof of work” where computers race to solve mathematical problems to verify transactions in return for a reward This slows the networks down and limits capacity Bitcoin can process only seven transactions per second; Ethereum can handle only 15 At busy times transactions are either very slow or very costly and sometimes both When demand to complete transactions on Ethereum network is high the fees paid to the computers that verify them climb and settlement times grow Your correspondent has paid as much as $70 to convert $500 into ether and waited for several minutes for a transfer from one crypto-wallet to another to take placeDevelopers have long been trying to improve Ethereum capacity One prong of that is in effect rewiring it Plans are afoot to shift Ethereum to a more easily scalable mechanism called “proof of stake” later this year Another idea is to split the blockchain up through a process called “sharding” The shards will share the load expanding capacity Some developers are also working on ways to bundle transactions reducing the number of them that must be directly verifiedThe problem is that each advance comes with costs DeFi supporters tout the virtue of being able to conduct transactions securely and without centralised intermediaries But gains in scale could come at a price by making the platform less secure or less decentralised Pooling transactions before they reach the blockchain tends to be done by centralised entities And it might be easier for hackers to attack a single shard of a blockchain than the entire thing As a result Ethereum developers have been slow to make changesThis sluggishness has made the network vulnerable in a different wayby encouraging rivals In early 2021 nearly all of the assets locked in DeFi applications were on Ethereum network But in a recent research note JPMorgan Chase a bank estimates that the share of DeFi applications using Ethereum fell to 70% by the end of 2021 A growing number of networks such as Avalanche Binance Smart Chain Terra and Solana now use proof of stake to run blockchains that do the same basic job as Ethereum but much more quickly and cheaply Avalanche and Solana for instance both process thousands of transactions a secondThe experience of USD Coin illustrates these shifts The token was launched on Ethereum just over three years ago but has since been launched on a number of competitor networks including Algorand Hedera and Solana Mr Allaire says that whereas transactions on Ethereum are subject to cost and speed limitations those on Solana can handle “Visa-scale volumes” with “settlement finality in about 400 milliseconds and a transaction cost of about a twentieth of a penny” Other DeFi applications like SushiSwap an exchange founded on Ethereum have also launched on several other blockchainsWith the planned changes to Ethereum likely to take at least a year if not longer “the risk is that…the Ethereum network will lose further market share” wrote Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of JPMorgan For Mr Allaire the picture is pleasingly competitive: “Just like with the web where Windows iOS and Android all compete there are competing blockchain platforms too” He thinks the ultimate victor will be the platform that attracts the best developers to build applications and therefore reaps network effectsBut the operating-system metaphor may only extend so far in part because of the nature of open public blockchains Anyone can access the data they produce and view their operating code making it possible to build bridges or applications that work across many blockchains or which aggregate information from different blockchains Some applications like 1inch already scan exchanges on several blockchains in order to find the best execution prices for various crypto transactions “Multi-chain” blockchains like Polkadot and Cosmos act like bridges between different networks making it possible to work across themFor as long as decentralised finance holds promise competition to be the network of choice will naturally be fierce But the idea that the eventual winner will take everything gaining overall control over the digital economy and how it develops may one day come to seem as outdated as the video cassette For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 22nd 2022,Why the bias for debt over equity is hard to dislodge,THE NICETIES of corporate finance rarely attract the attention of activists It is rarer still that those at either end of the political spectrum agree on the need for change When it comes to the tax system preferential treatment for debt over equity however both the left-wing Tax Justice Network and the fiscally conservative Tax Foundation agree that the “debt bias” needs correcting But the degree of consensus belies the difficulty of getting it doneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMost countries that levy taxes on corporate profits treat debt more favourably than equity largely because they allow interest payments like other costs to be deducted from tax bills That gives companies a huge incentive to borrow rather than to fund themselves through equity In America Britain Germany and Japan debt-based finance is taxed at rates that are 38-6 percentage points lower than those on equity investments according to the OECD The result is more indebtedness than would otherwise have been the case According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association the value of outstanding debt securities amounts to $123trn exceeding the $106trn in listed equities globally The IMF estimated in 2016 that the debt bias explained as much as 20% of investment banks’ total leverageThe bias affects a swathe of firms from small and unlisted family affairs to the world biggest public companies; and higher debt loads in general leave them more exposed to economic shocks But because trouble at highly leveraged lenders can easily throw the rest of the financial system into turmoil researchers have tended to concentrate on the effects on banks Total earnings are often thin relative to the large flows of interest payments made to and by lenders and removing the tax deductibility of interest could make some of them unprofitableThe debt bias grows as corporate taxes rise posing headaches for governments hoping to shake down profitable companies to plug fiscal holes It has therefore not gone unnoticed by the authoritiesthough recent attempts to restore balance have been marginal A rule that came into effect this year in America caps debt-interest tax-deductibility at 30% of a company earnings before interest and taxes as part of President Donald Trump 2017 tax reforms The EU is mulling a “debt-equity bias reduction allowance”  the details of which are yet to be made publicWhat would wholesale reform look like? In a paper published in 2017 Mark Roe of Harvard Law School and Michael Tröge of ESCP Business School put forward some ideas One is to treat debt less preferentially They imagine a bank with $50bn in gross profits and $40bn in interest payments With full deduction for interest and a corporate-tax rate of 20% the bank would pay tax of $2bn and have an incentive to rack up debt But if the interest deduction were removed altogether a tax rate of 20% would wipe out the bank entire net profit One solution would be to withdraw deductibility but to lower the tax on gross profits A rate of 7% in that scenario would yield as much to the taxman and pose the same burden to the bank as a 35% tax on net profitsAnother option which may be more politically viable than cutting tax rates is to make issuing equity more attractive The researchers propose a version of an allowance for corporate equity ACE which would make some share of a bank equityabove its regulatory requirementsas tax-friendly as debt If a bank had $100bn in equity above what it was required to issue an allowance of 5% would reduce its taxable profit by $5bn the same way that $100bn in debt with an interest rate of 5% would be treated The principle could be applied just as easily to non-financial firmsIndeed some European countries such as Italy and Malta have introduced ACE schemes for a wider set of companies The OECD reckons that Italy tax bias in favour of debt is now less than a percentage point The European Commission finds that the country scheme has reduced the leverage ratio of manufacturers by nine percentage points with a larger effect on smaller firmsReducing the bias then is not impossible But working out whether reform will upset the vast edifice of debt financing will be much harder to do especially in the larger markets of America or the wider EU Italy scheme covers only newly issued equity for this reason The preference for debt is deep-rooted enough that ripping it out could have large enduring effects on portfolios around the world Serious change may not come as quickly as the activists hopeFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:The faster metabolism of finance as seen by a veteran broker Jan 15thWhy gold has lost some of its investment allure Jan 8thWhy capital will become scarcer in the 2020s Jan 1st

 Jan 22nd 2022,Economists are revising their views on robots and jobs,WHEN THE pandemic first struck unemployment soared Not since the Depression had American joblessness surpassed 14% as it did in April 2020 But fears of a prolonged period of high unemployment did not come to pass According to the latest available data for November the unemployment rate for the OECD club of mostly rich countries was only marginally higher than it was before the pandemic By now it may even have drawn level The rich world labour-market bounceback is the latest phenomenon provoking economists to look again at a foundational question in the discipline: whether robots help or harm workersListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe gloomy narrative which says that an invasion of job-killing robots is just around the corner has for decades had an extraordinary hold on the popular imagination Warning people of a jobless future has ironically enough created plenty of employment for ambitious public intellectuals looking for a book deal or a speaking opportunity Shortly before the pandemic though other researchers were starting to question the received wisdom The world was supposedly in the middle of an artificial-intelligence and machine-learning revolution but by 2019 employment rates across advanced economies had risen to all-time highs Japan and South Korea where robot use was among the highest of all happened to have the lowest rates of unemploymentMany thought that the pandemic would at last prove the doom-mongers right In mid-2020 a highly cited paper published by America National Bureau of Economic Research argued that covid-19 “may accelerate the automation of jobs” and another asserted that it was “reinforcing both the trend towards automation and its effects” A paper published by the IMF wondered whether the jobs lost during the pandemic would “come back” Part of the logic was that since robots don’t fall ill bosses would turn to them instead of to peopleas seemed to have happened in some previous pandemics Others noted that bursts of automation tend to occur during recessionsTwo years on though the evidence for automation-induced unemployment is scant even as global investment spending is surging The rich world faces a shortage of workersby our reckoning there are a record 30m unfilled vacancies across the OECDwhich is hard to reconcile with the idea that people are no longer necessary Wage growth for low-skilled workers whose occupations are generally thought to be more vulnerable to replacement by robots is unusually fast There is still little evidence from America that “routine” jobs thought to be easier to automate are shrinking relative to other sorts of jobsConsidering that so many doubts about the “robots kill jobs” narrative have arisen it is not surprising that a different thesis is emerging In a recent paper Philippe Aghion Céline Antonin Simon Bunel and Xavier Jaravel economists at a range of French and British institutions put forward a “new view” of robots saying that “the direct effect of automation may be to increase employment at the firm level not to reduce it” This opinion heretical as it may sound does have a solid microeconomic foundation Automation might help a firm become more profitable and thus expand leading to a hiring spree Technology might also allow firms to move into new areas or to focus on products and services that are more labour-intensiveA growing body of research backs up the argument Daisuke Adachi of Yale University and colleagues look at Japanese manufacturing between 1978 and 2017 They find that an increase of one robot unit per 1000 workers boosts firms’ employment by 22% Another study by Joonas Tuhkuri of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and colleagues looks at Finnish firms and concludes that their adoption of advanced technologies led to increases in hiring Unpublished work by Michael Webb of Stanford University and Daniel Chandler of the London School of Economics examines machine tools in British industry and finds that automation had “a strong positive association with firm survival and that greater initial automation was associated with increases in employment”Non-economists can be forgiven for rolling their eyes at the profession apparent about-face But things are not as simple as saying that economists had got it wrong before For a start statistical methods have improved since the publication of the foundational papers in robonomics such as one by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University in 2013 which was widely interpreted as saying that 47% of American employment was at risk of automation The methodology used by Mr Adachi and his co-authors is particularly clever One problem is untangling causality: firms on a hiring spree may also happen to buy robots rather than the other way round But the paper shows that firms buy robots when their prices fall This helps establish a causal chain from cheaper robots to more automation to more jobsThe onrushing wave…of researchA second qualification is that the “new view” does not establish that automation is “good” So far it has had little to say about job quality and wages But a forthcoming book by David Autor David Mindell and Elisabeth Reynolds of MIT finds that even if robots do not create widespread joblessness they may have helped create an environment where the rewards are “skewed towards the top” Others argue that automation reduces job qualityMr Aghion and his colleagues add that even if automation boosts employment at the level of the firm or industry the effect across the economy as a whole is less clear In theory robot-adopting companies could be so successful that they drive competitors out of business reducing the total number of available jobs Such questions leave researchers with plenty more to investigate But what seems clear at this stage is that the era of sweeping gloomy narratives about automation is well and

 Jan 22nd 2022,As China economy slows policymakers seek to revive growth,"CHINA HAS not enjoyed much success at the sport of curling which will feature in the Beijing winter Olympics beginning on February 4th But the country economic policymakers could draw inspiration from the obscure event Like curlers they have a difficult target to hit They are thought to be aiming for growth of 5% or more in 2022 despite the threat posed by the arrival of the Omicron variant of covid-19 which has appeared in seven provinces big cities like Shanghai and Tianjin and was reported in Beijing for the first time on January 15thListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe parallels do not stop there Just as the curlers must slide a “stone” a kind of oversized puck with enough force to reach the target but not so much that it crashes off the ice so must China policymakers strike a balance They must give a slowing economy enough oomph to grow by 5% but not so much that it exceeds its limits contributing to inflation and speculationAccording to figures released on January 17th China GDP grew by 81% in 2021 its fastest pace since 2011 “Nominal” GDP which does not adjust for inflation grew even more quickly: by about 126% And because China currency also strengthened its GDP surpassed $177trn at market exchange rates an increase of 20% over the year before Judging by these numbers the economy would seem to have all the momentum it needsBut the pandemic so weakened China economy in early 2020 that the following year was always going to look unusually strong by comparison As 2021 progressed growth ebbed see chart 1 Now the economy must also contend with the Omicron variant Unlike other countries China has no intention to “live with” the virus even if its latest iteration is less severe than earlier ones It will instead try to keep covid least repressible variant at bay Mandatory testing in Tianjin for example has already forced Toyota to suspend carmaking at its joint venture in the city Volkswagen has experienced similar problemsMeanwhile Delta has not disappeared A wide-ranging lockdown was imposed on the city of Xi’an in central China after its officials failed to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant quickly enough Micron which assembles and tests DRAM microchips used for temporary storage in the city said the measures would have “some impact” on its plant output Samsung also said it will have to “adjust” production at its flash-memory factory which accounts for about 15% of the world capacity for NAND chips according to TrendForce a market-intelligence firm NAND chips are used for permanent storageChina overseas customers worry about what would happen if a Xi’an-style lockdown were imposed on a city closer to the heart of the country export machine But optimists point out that China export hubs lie mostly in more prosperous regions with more capable governments They have more effective contact tracing which could allow their lockdowns to be more precisely targeted After Omicron infections were discovered in Shanghai for example the authorities raised the “risk” level which entails tightened restrictions on movement not for the entire city or an entire district but for zones as small as a bubble tea shop where three workers were infected “Zero-covid has maybe 1000 faces in 1000 cities” says one analyst depending on the resources each place can lavish on the strategyThe more immediate economic threat posed by Omicron is not to foreign customers but to China own consumers Intermittent restrictions on travel and gatherings have hampered retail spending which grew by only 17% in nominal terms in December compared with a year earlier and shrank after adjusting for inflation Goldman Sachs a bank thinks further lockdowns this year could cut a full percentage point off growth in household consumption It has lowered its growth forecast for GDP as a whole from 48% to 43% below the government targetChina recent economic momentum has also suffered from coal shortages environmental limits on energy intensity regulatory crackdowns on consumer-facing tech companies and strict curbs on borrowing by property developers which forced several to default shaking the confidence of homebuyers In curling teams frantically sweep debris and other impediments out of the stone way to smooth its passage across the ice In China policymakers have been doing the opposite sweeping one regulatory obstacle after another into the economy pathWhat explains this regulatory zeal? After the economy bounced back quickly from the first wave of the pandemic China policymakers may have concluded that it was a good time to curb some of the negative side-effects of growth such as pollution and property speculation Economic momentum seemed assured Exports in particular boomed as people around the world spent less on face-to-face services during the pandemic and more on goods to keep them safe masks slim exercise bikes and sane games consolesBut this external source of growth may ebb over 2022 Foreigners are unlikely to splash out again on the home comforts that got them through recent lockdowns Customers who bought a games console or exercise bike in 2021 probably will not need an upgrade soon Moreover for China exports to grow from their current levels the splurge would have to be increased not merely repeatedSomewhat belatedly policymakers have now realised that growth needs stabilising On January 17th China central bank cut the interest rate on its one-year loans from 295% to 285% That was followed days later by a fall in the reference rates for bank loans These reductions follow a cut last month in the reserve requirements imposed on banksThe government is also easing fiscal policy It has extended income-tax breaks including favourable treatment for year-end bonuses It is encouraging local governments to issue more “special” bonds which are meant to be repaid out of revenues from the infrastructure projects they finance It is also hastening construction of 102 infrastructure “mega-projects” outlined in the country five-year plan for 2021-25 China state grid will for example build 13 ultra-high-voltage transmission lines in 2022 Increased infrastructure investment could add at least a percentage point to GDP growth in the first half of 2022 according to Morgan Stanley a bankAnalysts at Morgan Stanley are relatively confident about the government chances of meeting its growth target this year as long as policymakers bring about a soft landing for the property market Home sales fell by almost 18% in December compared with a year before To arrest this trend government officials have tried hard to reassure homebuyers that the flats they have bought in advance will be built even if the developer that sold them goes bust Mortgage rates are edging downwards And a number of cities have experimented with subsidies and tax cuts to encourage homebuying Rosealea Yao of Gavekal Dragonomics a consultancy thinks sales will improve in the first quarter compared with the previous three monthsBut although China national rulers are now committed to stabilising the economy they are still wary of overstimulating property which is prone to worrying speculative bubbles Beijing wants local governments to do enough but not too much After the northern province of Heilongjiang promised an “all-out sprint” to revive the property market the exhortation was soon removed from the internet points out Ms Yao The measured art of curling not sprinting is the better metaphor for the government aims Correction January 28th 2022: A previous version of this piece referred to the sweepers in curling as ""skaters"" In fact they do not wear skates For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter"
 Jan 15th 2022,The faster metabolism of finance as seen by a veteran broker,A FEW YEARS ago a stranger sidled up to me at a conference I had been introduced as an equity salesman with over 30 years of experience “Success or failure?” he asked impishly I laughed When I started in stockbroking anyone older than 50 carried an air of defeat If they hadn’t made enough money to retire early they were seen as losers Well I’m still here and I’m not the only one There is a lot more grey hair on the sales desks these daysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat is not the only change Trading revenue is slimmer because of regulation and new technology The way sell-side analysts and salespeople are paid has changed But the biggest difference is in the kinds of conversation I have and who I have them with Twenty years ago I hardly spoke to the fast-money crowd Now most of my day is taken up with them Share prices are set at the margin And the marginal buyer and seller is a hedge-fund managerHedge funds are behind much of the recent market drama The minutes of the Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting last week were a trigger The immediate prospect of tighter monetary policy spurred hedge funds to sell expensive “growth” shares notably those of technology companies the profits of which are expected to last long into the future Those distant earnings must now be discounted at a higher rate So tech shares fell At the same time a lot of the funds bought cheap “value” stocksI specialise in a sector that is seeing selling pressure But most of my hedge-fund clients trade at a more granular level They want to bet on the most resilient stocks on my patch and against those that will falter What matters to such “long-short” traders is that their longs do better than their shorts Their investment horizon is days and weeks not months and years There are lots of these hedge funds trading lots of stocks That is why beneath the surface the stockmarket is so noisyClients want to talk to me I know my industry well I have a good team of analysts behind me that is in regular contact with companies And I talk to a lot of other investors Everyone has the same hard datathe stock price the financial statements the consensus forecasts for earnings and the firm “guidance” around those numbers But the hedge funds are trying to anticipate short-term shifts They come to me for soft dataI get asked all sorts of questions How confident does the finance director of firm X seem about making the numbers?

 Jan 15th 2022,The $28trn global reach of Asian finance,THE COUNTRIES of East and South-East Asia are renowned even envied for reshaping global supply chains Less well appreciated is the extent to which they have redrawn the map of global capital flows After a buying spree over the past decade or so the region ten biggest economies now hold nearly $28trn in foreign financial assets more than three times the amount in 2005 and equivalent to a fifth of global assets held by foreigners Once-staid institutions that are little-known in the Westfrom obscure Japanese banks and Taiwanese insurers to South Korean pension fundsnow wield heft in markets for assets ranging from collateralised-loan obligations CLOs in America to high-speed rail lines in BritainListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEast Asia has long been recognised as a contributor to the global “saving glut” a concept popularised by Ben Bernanke then a governor at the Federal Reserve in 2005 The scale of Asia foreign holdings has only grown since as the region has become richer and older The Economist has looked at figures for the foreign financial assets of ten East and South-East Asian economies We define these as total gross foreign assets excluding foreign direct investment by multinationals; our measure captures investment portfolios and bank lending among other things The combined foreign financial assets of our ten countries rose from around $8trn in 2005 to nearly $28trn in 2020 increasing the region share in global foreign-held financial assets by five percentage points see chart 1The composition of Asia savings hoard has also changed strikingly so in some places When Mr Bernanke conducted his analysis foreign-exchange reserves held by governments and central banks in our set of ten economies accounted for about half of a country foreign financial assets on average These had been stockpiled after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 as a bulwark against future currency collapse and were held in safe liquid assets Now the average share of reserves has fallen to nearer a third The rest of the stockpile is made up of portfolio and other financial flows which have exploded as institutional investors in the region have hunted for yield overseasThe shift is drawing the attention of financial watchdogs In December the Bank for International Settlements BIS a club of central banks concluded that Asian institutional investors had contributed to dollar funding stress in March 2020 as covid-19 first began to spread and markets panicked Yet much about these financial interlinkages and the risks associated with them is still poorly understoodOur sample of countries can be split into three camps The wealthiest handfulHong Kong Japan and Singaporehold significant foreign-exchange reserves but their hoards of other financial assets are between five and eight times larger Their holdings are now mature and slower-growing by regional standardsA bigger shift has taken place in South Korea and Taiwan see chart 2 In 2005 almost half of Taiwan foreign financial assets and two-thirds of South Korea took the form of reserves Although reserves have since more than doubled for both countries portfolio and other assets have expanded at a far more rapid clip South Korea and Taiwan now own $15trn and $21trn in foreign financial assets respectively less than a third of which is held in reserves In Malaysia too non-reserve financial assets now outweigh reserves two-to-one By contrast for a third set of countries which includes China Indonesia the Philippines and Thailand reserves still retain a large shareThe growth in foreign financial holdings has gone hand-in-hand with the transformation of conservative institutional investors into big players in distant corners of financial markets A prime example is Norinchukin Bank an agricultural co-operative in Japan It holds some ¥48trn $42bn in CLOs securities made up of portfolios of loans most of which are denominated in dollars Before it slowed purchases in 2019 it was widely considered the largest buyer of CLOs in AmericaStepping outsideTaiwan insurers such as Cathay Life Insurance and Fubon Life Insurance have become influential institutions in a number of international markets Their total assets have nearly tripled over the past decade And more of them are now held overseas By the end of 2020 almost 60% of their assets comprised foreign investments up from 30% in 2010Such institutional investment is now so widespread that Formosa bonds foreign-currency bonds issued in Taiwan by a range of global firms and governments have taken off since the securities were designated as domestic rather than foreign debt allowing insurers to skirt regulatory limits on foreign-security ownership By the end of 2021 the outstanding value of dollar Formosa bonds alone was $195bn compared with $84bn six years earlierSouth Korea National Pension Service has also sought more overseas exposure announcing a flurry of global ventures Foreign assets made up 37% of the pension fund last year nearly double the share in 2013 and the firm aims to increase that to 50% by 2024 The strategy is to chase returns not only abroad but also in less liquid asset classes before the fund benefit payouts start to increase in the early 2040sMalaysia Employees Provident Fund EPF which manages mandatory pension investments for the country private-sector employees provides another illustration of Asian institutions’ foreign reach Last year it launched what it called the world largest sharia private-equity fund with BlackRock HarbourVest Partners and Partners Group each managing a third of the allotted $600m The EPF foreign assets have also climbed from 29% of the total in mid-2017 to 37% in mid-2021The result of all this activity is that Asian institutional investors have become enormous swing buyers in certain markets “They’re disproportionately large in Australia” says Martin Whetton of Commonwealth Bank of Australia The country is the third-largest location of assets for Japanese life insurers he says and tends to make up about 10-15% of their portfolios Mr Whetton points out that purchases of Australian dollar assets in North Asia are large enough to shift the country cross-currency basis the premium that traders pay to temporarily exchange other currencies for AustraliaSome institutions have made promises of guaranteed payouts to clients and as interest rates have sunk to rock-bottom levels have had little option but to hunt for yield in less highly rated or more illiquid asset classes Industry insiders note that insurers in the region have moved increasingly into emerging-market debt and higher-yielding Asian bonds Private illiquid assets have also become more popular Asian investors have long been drawn to private equity and property says Anish Butani of bfinance an investment consultancy Now “we’re really seeing a surge of activity in infrastructure and private debt”To observers such as the BIS and the IMF all this signifies greater financial risks than when more holdings took the form of safe highly liquid reserve assets Cross-border financial flows can be volatile and flighty transmitting stress from one part of the world to another and posing risks both to the buyers and the markets in which they participate Although many institutions must pay clients in their domestic currencies few appear to hedge their entire foreign-currency exposure Private assets are harder to sell quickly at reliable prices potentially posing liquidity problems should investors need to pull out Precise coherent figures on the composition riskiness and liquidity of holdings are still hard to get hold of making it difficult to gauge the overall pictureUnderstanding what going on could become more important still if China eventually follows the path of East Asian economies At present its reserves of more than $3trn dwarf its other financial holdings A shifting composition of foreign assets is not a matter of destiny and would require some loosening of China capital controls But even a marginal move towards more portfolio investment could produce huge flows of capital “Chinese insurers have a lot of interest in investing overseas” says Rick Wei of JPMorgan Asset Management “They want to diversify their holdings increase returns and match their liabilities with longer-term assets” Even after more than a decade of rampant growth in Asia private foreign holdings more may be yet to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly

 Jan 15th 2022,Will remote work stick after the pandemic?,BOSTON IS NOT the most popular of winter travel destinations But many economists were nonetheless disappointed by the news that their profession grand annual meetings scheduled to take place in the city in early January would again be virtual Greater experience with remote-conferencing technologies meant that events unfolded more smoothly than they did a year ago That seemed appropriate for a conference dominated by speculation about how covid-19 might permanently alter the economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMany sessions were devoted to sketching out the probable features of the post-pandemic world New habits are stickingand economists have gathered the data to prove it Take remote work Jose Maria Barrero of the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México presented results from research with Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago Since May 2020 the economists have conducted a monthly survey that among other things asks Americans about their plans to work remotely A year ago the results suggested that remote work would account for 20% of full-time hours after the pandemicOver the past year however remote work has gained favour Based on the survey results from December the researchers reckon that 28% of hours might ultimately be worked from home Employees who were once undecided now say they might sometimes work from home said Mr Barrero And respondents who had always said they would toil remotely now plan to spend more time doing so In all about 15% of full-time workers are expected to be fully remote in future and just under a third to work in a “hybrid” fashiona dramatic change from before the pandemic when just 5% of people laboured at homeRemote work will persist because the experience of it has been better than expected and because workers and firms have invested time and money together estimated by Mr Barrero to be worth about 07% of America GDP in improving it further But new arrangements will also be driven by employees’ preferences Though many workers look forward to returning to the office a sizeable chunkabout 15%say they would definitely or probably leave employers who do not offer remote options This has created an opportunity for young firms to attract talent by hiring remotely said Adam Ozimek of Upwork a freelance-work platformAs the opportunities to toil remotely have grown people have become happier to move away from big expensive cities Mr Ozimek noted that research published early in the pandemic suggested that the most significant geographical impact of new working arrangements would be on the distribution of population within cities Reductions in commuting time as a result of hybrid arrangements would produce a “doughnut effect” as people left city centres for distant suburbs But analysis of more recent data suggests that moves between cities are increasingly significant Places with high housing costs and a large share of workers in jobs that can be done remotely have experienced slower growth in house prices and rents than other areas Whereas data from 2020 sent an ambiguous message about migration trends figures for 2021 show clear outflows from high-cost places like CaliforniaSome parts of the world may face uncomfortable adjustments as a result rather as deindustrialisation placed severe strains on parts of America and Europe in the 1970s and 1980s Research presented at the conference by Conor Walsh of Columbia University noted that the economic burden of the pandemic fell hardest on less-skilled service workers in dense and expensive cities who previously catered to the needs of skilled workers A permanent exodus of white-collar professionals could leave some less-skilled workers trapped in places with declining job prospectsA more remote future could yield some offsetting benefits though Studies of pockets of the economy suggest that pandemic-related shifts hold the potential for productivity gains Emma Harrington of Princeton University discussed research showing that the productivity of workers at call-centres rose by 76% when work went remote without a detectable decline in customer satisfaction Dan Zeltzer of Tel Aviv University presented analysis of the shift to telemedicine in Israel which showed that the utilisation of resources tended to rise and costs to decline with little sign of more missed diagnoses or other negative health outcomesVirtually unrecognisableWhether such gains will translate into a stronger macroeconomy is less clear Janice Eberly of Northwestern University credited remote work with reducing the decline in GDP in early 2020 by nearly half relative to what it might otherwise have been Yet although remote work might boost companies’ profits by lowering the costs of office space and improve welfare by reducing commuting she doubted that it was a fundamental enough shift to lead to enduring productivity gains That chimed with other more general fears about the post-pandemic economy Catherine Mann of the Bank of England worried that business investment might prove insufficient held back by uncertainty about growth prospects and uncompetitive markets Though investment was strong in 2021 recent surveys show diminished appetite for capital spending she noted compared with share buybacks and mergersLarry Summers of Harvard University observed that although central banks may struggle to control inflation in the short term long-run growth is likely still to be restrained by the same headwinds such as demographic change that blew before covid-19 The upshot of the conference often seemed to be that although economies have done better during the pandemic than many people dared hope they are likely to disappoint in its aftermath But as participants from around the globe zoomed seamlessly from session to session without having to visit an airport or queue up for coffee one had to wonder whether such conclusions were

There are reasons to be sceptical Were the $25trn shared equally across the country it would amount to about $7500 for every Americanmore than the combined total of the three rounds of stimulus cheques In practice the distribution is far from equal In the decade before covid-19 the wealthiest 1% of Americans had in aggregate about twice as much in cash and chequable bank deposits as the bottom 50% The pandemic has skewed this further: the top 1% now has four times as much as the bottom half Although the government directed its assistance towards poorer Americans the ultra-rich reaped far greater rewards thanks in large part to soaring asset pricesThat matters in trying to assess the potential impact of excess savings The wealthy typically spend a low share of their incomes The extra cash sitting in their hands is more likely to go towards investment accounts than grocery purchasesAnother dampener may be the nature of the economic recovery In a paper last year Martin Beraja and Christian Wolf of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that recoveries from recessions where falls in spending are concentrated on goods tend to be stronger than those with cuts concentrated on services Pent-up demand for say smartphones can be released in a flood By contrast demand for beach holidays returns more slowly: vacationers can only be in one place at a time This suggests that as the pandemic fades the flow of savings into services such as travel and entertainment may be sluggishA final concern is high inflation That eats into both wealth and incomes Adjusted for rising prices wage growth in America has turned sharply negative over the past half-year Similarly the real value of savings looks a bit less impressive given the reduction in purchasing powerThe story does not end there though Surveys by the Fed New York branch indicate that stimulus recipients saved about one-third of the cash and used another third to pay down debts That helps explain why households’ balance-sheets are healthier today than before the pandemic regardless of their level of income see chart 2 They thus have scope to borrow and spend moreThis may already be happening Consumer borrowing soared in November by $40bn the most on record as credit-card usage soared Some observers saw that as a sign that households were strapped for cash Alex Lin of Bank of America disagrees “An increase in credit-card spending can be a function of greater re-engagement in the economy” he says “Americans like to use their credit cards to rack up points for travel or restaurants and that is not necessarily a sign of danger”The damage from inflation may also prove tolerable especially if the Fed tightening plus supply-chain improvements brings prices back under control Wage growth has been stronger for those on lower incomes the group most vulnerable to a reduction in real spending power In November annual nominal wage growth for the bottom quartile of earners reached 51% versus 27% for the top quartile according to the Atlanta FedAs a whole Americans saved about 69% of their incomes in November less than the 74% average in the five years before the pandemic Yet this is exactly what should be seen if some people are dipping into their excess savings It is also a key reason why most forecasters think the economy will grow by about 4% this year a robust pace in the face of headwindsAnd that barely grapples with the changes that the extra cash enabled for many recipients In another hip-hop track Reneé the Entertainer sings of a woman who splurged on a buttock-augmentation procedure: “She spent the stimmy/on the booty/in Miami” Reneé whose real name is Mariah Pizarro in fact put her money to what is arguably a more productive use “I used them to get a more reliable vehicle” she says Although Ms Pizarro dreams of a music career the car has for now facilitated a less glamorous occupation It lets her drive to work at an Amazon warehouse For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 15th 2022,The new government hopes to cure Germans’ distaste for the stockmarket,THE 177-PAGE coalition agreement between Germany Social Democrats Free Democrats FDP and the Greens contains grand plans to combat climate change and covid-19 and to speed up digitisation Tucked away on page 73 is a more modest promise to fund a small part of its public-pension scheme by investing in stocks Reactions in Germany ranged from the apprehensive to the enraged “Is our pension safe in stock?” fretted one news outlet Another asked: “Are politicians gambling away our pension?”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs retirees live longer Germany pension system which was established in 1889 by Otto von Bismarck is buckling Workers and bosses together pay a “pension tax” of about 18% of a worker gross wage This is meant to fund the roughly €300bn $340bn or about 9% of GDP paid out in pensions each year But shortfalls have meant that the government has had to subsidise the scheme to the tune of €100bn last year The problem is only set to get worse as more baby-boomers retireIn order to help fix the problem the liberal FDP has long supported a plan to reshape the pension scheme along Swedish lines Sweden system consists of a standard pension to which taxpayers contribute 16% of their gross income and a supplemental “premium” pension through which 25% of each taxpayer income is placed into a stock fund of their choosing Should the taxpayer decide against active investment the money is deposited instead in a state fund which since 2003 has made an annual return of 99%The plan outlined in Germany coalition deal is far more modest The government will funnel €10bn from its annual budget into a publicly managed pension fund which will be invested in the stockmarket and which may generate attractive returns The principal itself accounts for only about ten days of pension payments says Martin Werding of the Ruhr University Bochum who conducted a feasibility study of the FDP proposal ahead of the election But the party hopes it may only be a first step towards a “stock-and-bond covered pension system”The reaction to the government plan tells you much about Germans’ attitudes to capital markets Studies indicate that they are “market-shy” and tend to overestimate the risks from investing Only around a quarter of households own stocks By contrast more than half of all American households do so much of it in the form of 401k retirement plans This could in part reflect differences between the two countries’ tax systems Germany imposes a higher tax rateof 25%on long-term capital gains for instanceThen there are Germany scars from the dotcom era In 1996 Deutsche Telekom listed on the stockmarket Germans headed to the market in droves; about 650000 of the buyers of the newly issued stock were first-time punters The share price soared seven-fold before crashing spectacularly in the early 2000s The effects still linger Those who held Deutsche Telekom shares or who might remember the crash are less likely to hold stocks even today as are their children suggests research published last year by the German Institute for Economic Research DIW a think-tank in Berlin Even by 2020 the number of Germans investing in the stockmarket was still a shade below its 2001 levelThe FDP hopes that the planned changes to the pension scheme might increase Germans’ familiarity with stock investing “The Swedes really aren’t known as turbo-capitalistic stock gamblers” jokes Johannes Vogel the party expert on pension politics The coalition government also aims to make it easier for people to save for retirement outside their state pension The tax-free personal allowance on capital gains will rise from €800 to €1000 a year in 2023 and the coalition hopes to launch an inquiry into the creation of a Swedish-style public-investment fundThese changes alone might do little to put the pension system on a sustainable footing and make pensioners better off That says Marcel Fratzscher of the DIW would require a change to the state retirement age as well as labour-market reforms Nonetheless he reckons the plans provide a “glimmer of hope” that the government realises at least that the system needs reform 
 Jan 8th 2022,A war of words ends with the Democrats in charge of a key regulator,“POWER GRAB” An “attempt to politicise our regulators for their own gain” “Extremist destruction of institutional norms” The rhetoric flying around Washington sounds like the criticism once levelled against President Donald Trump about hot-button issues from border security to pollution controls Instead it is Republicans who have directed these barbs at Democrats in recent days focused on something that on the surface seems far duller: the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the agency tasked with protecting savers from bank bustsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAs the heated language suggests the stakes are in fact high Along with insuring bank accounts the FDIC is one of the institutions that approves bank mergers in America That makes it a crucial player in the Biden administration plans to impose stricter rules on the financial system And the Democrats have now taken full control of it after a nasty boardroom battleDemocrats already held three of five seats on the FDIC board which should in theory have let them have their way But the chairwoman was still Jelena McWilliams a respected lawyer appointed by Mr Trump She had the power to set the agenda for meetings The Democrats alleged that she used it to block a review of the policy for bank mergerswhich she has deniedThe dispute exploded publicly last month when two Democrats on the board including Rohit Chopra director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau attempted to work around Ms McWilliams They announced that the Democratic majority had voted for a review of bank-merger rules without her support Ms McWilliams countered that there had not been a valid vote In an article in the Wall Street Journal she accused them of plotting “a hostile takeover of the FDIC” On December 31st with the board split beyond repair she announced her resignationThe clash is a window onto the efforts of progressives within the Democratic party to make their mark on the institutions overseeing the economy Mr Chopra is an ally of Elizabeth Warren a senator who is a champion of the Democrats’ left wing Others liked by Ms Warrennotably Lina Khan head of the Federal Trade Commission and Gary Gensler chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commissionare also in key rolesProgressives have not won all the personnel fights Saule Omarova their preferred candidate to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency a banking regulator withdrew from the nomination process in December after Republicans decried her as a “radical” The reappointment of Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve was another disappointment for the left Yet with three seats open on the Fed board progressives can make inroads Most crucially Mr Biden is expected to nominate Sarah Bloom Raskin another preferred candidate of Ms Warren as the Fed vice-chairwoman for supervision the most important regulatory post in the financial systemWhat do the progressives hope to achieve? It is already clear that they want to curb big tech The row at the FDIC reveals that they also intend to limit the formation of big banks For now the review of the bank-merger policy is just a request for information But the questions posed by Mr Chopra in a blog post in December leave little doubt about his desired direction: “Should financial institutions that routinely violate consumer-protection laws be allowed to expand through acquisition? …How should we make sure that a merger does not increase the risk that a bank is too big to fail?”Many bank analysts like the idea of midsized American firms banding together to take on the big four JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Citigroup and Wells Fargo Progressives would argue that this gets things backwards If the power of giant banks imperils financial stability the creation of yet more giants would only exacerbate that says one official Other possible changes include integrating climate concerns into financial regulation and beefing up some capital requirements Democrats will as ever need to surmount legislative and lobbying hurdles to make any of this happen But with the FDIC now firmly in their grasp the path is a little clearer For more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated  hub and follow along as we track shifts in his  approval rating For more analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 8th 2022,The rise of personalised stock indices,IN 2001 ANDREW LO a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology predicted that technological advances would one day allow investors to create their own personal indices designed to meet their financial aims risk preferences and tax considerations Such an idea “may well be science fiction today” Mr Lo wrote but “it is only a matter of time” More than 20 years later that time may have comeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA revolution in passive investing that began in the 1970s led to the introduction of funds that track the performance of an index such as the S&P 500 affording investors diversification at a low cost Now a growing number of American fund managers and brokers are offering retail clients more personalised products that combine the benefits of passive investing with greater customisation Direct-indexed accounts as such products are known promise to track the performance of a benchmark index But unlike off-the-shelf mutual funds or exchange-traded funds ETFs which are pooled investment vehicles overseen by portfolio managers investors in direct-indexed accounts own the underlying securities and can tailor their portfolios to suit their needsThe idea is not new “Separately managed accounts” custom portfolios of securities managed by professional investors have been around since the 1970s But such products have historically been available only to institutional investors and “ultra-high-net-worth” clients with millions of dollars to invest Today direct-indexed accounts are within reach of the “mass affluent” with liquid assets in the hundreds of thousands “It what institutions have been doing for years” explains Martin Small head of the US wealth-advisory business at BlackRock an asset manager “But with technology and scale and more automation we can deliver it in smaller account sizes”Analysts point to three forces behind the trend The first is advances in technology including sophisticated algorithms and the computing power needed to continuously analyse and execute trades across hundreds of thousands of portfolios simultaneously The second is the rise of zero-commission trading which dramatically lowers costs The third is the emergence of fractional-share trading which allows investors to buy securities in bite-sized pieces making it easier to build small diversified portfolios Companies like Amazon a single share of which costs more than $3000 can be included without breaking the bankDirect indexing is still a small part of the asset-management industry According to Cerulli Associates a research firm roughly $400bn was held in direct-indexed accounts by the end of June 2021 But Morgan Stanley a bank and Oliver Wyman a consultancy estimate that this figure could reach $15trn by 2025 representing a growth rate of nearly 40% a year Industry executives are bullish “Personalised investing is coming at all of us like a freight train” Walt Bettinger the boss of Charles Schwab a broker said in OctoberSuch enthusiasm has fuelled a flurry of acquisitions In October 2020 Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric Portfolio Associates the biggest provider of direct-indexing services A month later BlackRock snapped up Aperio Group another big provider Several other big fund managers and brokers including Charles Schwab Vanguard and Franklin Templeton have made similar acquisitions “Nobody wants to be left behind” says Kevin Maeda the chief investment officer of direct indexing at Natixis a bank “There a gold-rush mentality” reckons Tom O’Shea of CerulliDirect indexing has both benefits and costs Its main selling point is its ability to lower tax bills This is achieved primarily through a process called “tax-loss harvesting” which involves selling and replacing losing stocks to offset gains in winning ones thereby reducing capital gains subject to taxation Although this technique can generate returns on the order of 1-15% per year the benefits are close to nothing for individuals in lower tax brackets or for investors who hold the bulk of their assets in retirement accounts such as 401k plans which defer taxes on investment gains until funds are withdrawnAnother advantage of these accounts over conventional mutual funds or ETFs is customisation For ethically minded punters this could mean excluding fossil-fuel producers tobacco companies or weapons-makers The more customisation the greater the likelihood that portfolio returns diverge from benchmark returnsDirect-indexed accounts are often characterised as a disruptive threat to mutual funds and ETFs In truth they are part of the same long-term trend “This is really about the growth of indexing” says Mr Small of BlackRock “The growth of direct indexing and ETFs go together they’re just different ways to gain index exposure” he adds Brian Langstraat of Parametric Portfolio Associates says that the primary driver of direct indexing is not lower costs or fractional shares but the decades-long shift towards passive investing “The trends that are behind it are the same ones as five years ago” he says “and will be the same ones five years from now” For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in

 Jan 8th 2022,Why gold has lost some of its investment allure,INFLATION IS SURGING central-bank money-printing has run amok and political tensions between the world powers are intensifying These ingredients sound like a waking fantasy for ardent believers in the long-term promise of gold Even mainstream investors might have been tempted to increase their holdings of the precious metal Why then was it unable to eke out even a marginal gain in 2021 recording its worst annual performance in six years?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor conventional investors valuing gold poses a problem The precious metal does not generate a stream of income Since demand for it tends to be speculative the cash-flow models used to work out whether assets are cheap or expensive cannot be appliedOne measure however contains predictive power Every big move in the price of gold particularly in the period since the global financial crisis has been inversely correlated with moves in real interest rates There are few financial relationships that have held up as well as that between the price of gold and the yield on inflation-protected Treasuries TIPS The lower real safe yields are the greater the appeal of an asset without a yield that may rise in valuePart of the explanation for gold underwhelming performance last year is that this relationship continued to hold Despite the frenzy over inflation ten-year real interest rates began the year at -106% and ended at -104% Gold ended 2021 at around $1822 per troy ounce practically flat on the year Over the past decade though gold has been the less reliable of the two If you had simply held the iShares TIPS bond exchange-traded fund in that time you would have made 35% more than double what you would have earned by holding goldRegulation has also dulled the precious metal sheen New rules on bank-funding ratios as part of the Basel III accord came into effect in the EU in June and in Britain on January 1st These consider government bonds to be “high-quality liquid assets” By contrast holders of gold like those of equities must match 85% of their holdings with funding from stable sources That makes gold costlier for banks to hold and puts it at a disadvantage compared with Treasuries If the yellow metal is simply a less reliable proxy for TIPS without the friendly regulatory treatment why bother?The answer for some investors would once have been clear Paper money and government-issued bonds are ephemeral and catastrophic failures of financial systems often stem from overconfidence in their safety But gold the argument goes has stood the test of time The dollar became America national currency only in 1863 People have prized precious metals for millenniaYet gold status as the final line of defence against currency mismanagement is also being contested Cryptocurrencies particularly bitcoin are increasingly found in more mainstream portfolios The asset class was once too small to dent the appetite for gold Now bitcoin and ether the two biggest cryptocurrencies have a combined market capitalisation of around $13trn ten times what it was two years ago That is around a tenth of the perhaps $12trn of gold holdings based on the World Gold Council estimate that a little over 200000 tonnes of the yellow metal exists above groundIn 2020 Chris Wood of Jefferies an investment bank and a long-time advocate of gold signalled which way the wind was blowing He cut his rather sizeable recommended allocation to physical bullion for dollar-based pension funds from 50% to 45% and redirected the five percentage points to bitcoin In November last year he did the same again raising the bitcoin allocation to 10% at the expense of goldBitcoin wild price swings may for now limit the interest of the more conservative gold bug Over the past five years the gold price has movedboth up and downby an average of 06% a day compared with a daily move in bitcoin of 35% But that need not be a show-stopper in the long run As analysts at Morgan Stanley have noted gold also began its life as a modern investment asset in the mid-1970s and early 1980s with bouts of extreme volatility It took almost two decades after the ownership of gold was legalised in America in 1974 for it to become widely held by institutionsA spell of comparative irrelevance for the metal then cannot be ruled out Stuck between more reliable safe assets on one side and more exciting speculative crypto-assets on the other gold now finds itself in an awkward positionFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why capital will become scarcer in the 2020s Jan 1stWhy the dollar ascendancy won’t last Dec 11thHave SPACs been cleaned up?

 Jan 8th 2022,The EU green-investing “taxonomy” could go global,HOURS BEFORE Brussels entered 2022 a bombshell dropped In a draft sent to EU countries the European Commission proposed classing some nuclear and gas projects as green in its “taxonomy” a list meant to define sustainable investing Austria threatened to sue; Germany cried foul The plan is still likely to win majority support from member states which have until January 12th to opine It could set the terms for green investing well beyond Europe But will it steer capital towards deserving projects?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe idea emerged after the 2015 Paris climate deal when the EU effort to craft a common green-bond standard for corporate and sovereign issuers revealed that members did not agree on what counted as green Some countries have since worked on their own classifications but Europe which maps swathes of the economy over 550 pages is the most comprehensiveThe taxonomy hopes to end the practice of greenwashing and boost investors’ faith in sustainable assets It will offer a common set of criteria that investors and banks can use to screen potential investments Most money managers already have their own teams and tools to measure greenery But the lack of a shared benchmark means scorecards remain subjective and inconsistent across the industry which confuses investors Having a dictionary where they can look up whether an investment can be labelled green puts everyone on the same pageAnother aspect of the plan is to link the taxonomy to disclosure Starting later this year some 11000 listed European firms will have to report how much of their sales and capital expenditure fits within the classification the number of businesses covered will eventually expand to 50000 Since January 1st asset managers must already detail what share of the products they label sustainable is compliant with the bits of the taxonomy that are already in force From 2024 most European banks will also have to report a “green asset ratio” using the same criteria All this should put more and better climate-related data in the public domain “It is our best hope globally to measure how much money is going into activities aligned with net zero” says Daniel Klier of Arabesque an asset managerEventually the classification will also underpin EU certifications for securities issuers creating a direct link with capital markets The green-bond standard for one is expected to use the taxonomy as its benchmark for eligibility The commission will probably also use the classification as it doles money out to member states from its Recovery Fund some of which is linked to greeneryThe degree of detail and stringency of Europe approach could help make the taxonomy the global gold standard Other countries outside the bloc are working on schemes of their own Each will probably be moulded by political compromises geostrategic concerns and carbon pledges But foreign companies asset managers and banks could end up adopting the EU taxonomy anyway because their European clients may need them to report the right data so as to produce their own disclosures Some may lobby their own governments to limit divergenceWhether all this is enough to channel funds towards the right investments is another question One immediate problem relates to implementation: because of missed deadlines green-finance firms are being asked to report on their compliance with the taxonomy before companies are required to provide the underlying data making the job difficultA bigger drawback is the taxonomy limited coverage At present it applies to a subset of economic activities Disclosure requirements also let small public companies and all private ones off the hook Morningstar a research firm reckons it will affect just half of fund assets in the EU excluding private vehicles That leaves much in the dark at a time when listed giants including miners and utilities are rushing to divest their dirtiest assets to private investors More may come to light as the EU reporting requirements expand to cover new companies some of them private But that will take timeThe biggest problem lies in the flawed expectation that the mere existence of the taxonomy will alter investors’ preferences A project greenery is just “one data point” says David Henry Doyle of S&P a rating agency Creditworthiness interest rates and earnings prospects may matter more The classification notably creates no incentive for backing green assets that are starved of funding such as low-carbon steel or electric-car charging stations Instead investors may continue to chase safe liquid assets such as wind or solar plants jacking up prices Green is good but it is not enoughFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 8th 2022,Economists are agreeing with each other more,OBSERVERS HAVE long poked fun at the inability of the economics profession to make up its mind “If parliament were to ask six economists for an opinion seven would come back” runs one version of an old joke Yet the gibes may be losing their force A new paper by Doris Geide-Stevenson and Alvaro La Parra Perez of Weber State University finds that economists are agreeing with each other more on a number of policy-related questionsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe paper publishes the results of the latest wave of a survey of economists that has been conducted roughly once a decade since 1976 though the results of the first wave are not entirely comparable with later ones Members of the American Economic Association were asked whether they agreed with a number of propositions ranging from the economic impact of minimum-wage increases to the desirability of universal health insurance Based on the frequency of responses the researchers devised an index that captured the degree of consensus on each questionThe results suggest that the extent of consensus has risen significantly Economists were in strong agreement on about a third of the propositions in the latest wave compared with around 15% in 2011 and less than 10% in 1990 see top panel Respondents were more united on their diagnosis of economic problems And strikingly more of them were convinced of the need for muscular policyInequality was a growing concern The share of respondents who wholly or somewhat agreed that the distribution of income in America should be more equal rose from 68% in 2000 to 86% in 2020-21 Fully 85% thought corporate power was too concentrated Another worry was climate change which most agreed posed a big risk to the economy Both questions were asked for the first time in the latest waveUnsurprisingly given their views on market power respondents’ support for a vigorous use of antitrust policy has increased markedly over the past two decades see bottom panel Another notable change was in the enthusiasm for fiscal activism More economists thought that the Federal Reserve alone could not manage the business cycleperhaps consistent with the decline in its policy rate towards zeroand were keener on a bigger role for government More of them also agreed that fiscal policy could have important economic effects both during downturns and over the long termThe dismal science has not become entirely harmonious though Economists were slightly more split on the consequences of lowering income and capital-gains taxes in the latest wave with roughly half of respondents agreeing with the propositions put to them by the researchers and the rest disagreeing Enough room still for healthy debateFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 8th 2022,The IMF bashes the IMF over Argentina,INFLATION IN ARGENTINA had intensified the IMF lamented The cost of living had increased by some 50% over the course of the year “The most important source of inflation” the fund explained “was government-deficit spending financed by borrowing from the central bank” The deficit in turn reflected excessive wage demands and the failure of the country utilities to raise prices in line with costs The year was 1958 At the end of it Argentina turned to the fund for its first “standby arrangement” a line of credit accompanied by a plan to stabilise the economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSixty years later in June 2018 Argentina was back for its 21st arrangement: a $50bn loan later increased to $57bn backed by the government promises to cut the budget deficit and strengthen the central bank in the hope of quelling inflation and stabilising the peso The loan was the largest in the IMF history It has left Argentina so in hock to the fund that the country will need a new longer-term loan to help it repay its existing one Despite its size the rescue failed to save Argentina from default and despair It has also left the fund heavily exposed to a single country when many other emerging economies may soon need its helpThe IMF dance with Argentina over the decades has attracted plenty of criticism The institution has been variously described as too indulgent and too punitive too kind and too cruel Conservative critics think the fund has been seduced by its dance partner wasting public money in a futile battle with market forces The left on the other hand thinks the fund is both neocolonial ie too bossy and neoliberal ie too enamoured of free marketsThe fund latest critic is the fund itself Shortly before Christmas it published a lengthy evaluation of its 2018 arrangement with Argentina led by staff who had not been involved with it It concludes that the rescue was not “robust” enough to withstand the foreseeable risks it faced Argentina economy the report points out suffers from some longstanding structural weaknesses Its public finances are notoriously fragile only 15% of the workforce pay income tax according to the OECD and energy is heavily subsidised Its financial system is shallow which tempts the government to borrow from fickle foreigners instead Its range of exports is narrow Inflation is stubbornly high and responds only fitfully to tighter monetary policy Argentines like to hold their deposits in dollars And they often price things with reference to it That means that inflation rises quickly when the peso dropsThe government of Mauricio Macri which requested the IMF loan also faced tight political constraints His centre-right party did not hold a majority in the legislature and he had to stand for re-election in 2019 before any painful economic reforms would have time to bear fruit Given these difficulties the fund knew the loan was risky Yet it did not insist on adequate contingency plans upfront the evaluation points out At the outset the fund hoped that a big loan would restore the confidence of foreign investors stabilising the peso and allowing the government to roll over its dollar debt on reasonable terms The government liabilities would then prove easier to bear and the confidence of its creditors would be self-fulfilling Moreover Argentina might not need to draw down its IMF credit line entirely leaving the fund less exposed to the country than the headline amount suggestedThis gamble soon failed Foreign capital kept retreating the peso kept falling and inflation kept rising The evaluation speculates that the size of the IMF loan may even have been “self-defeating” eroding confidence rather than inspiring it since foreign investors knew the fund would be repaid before themIn October 2018 once it became clear that Argentina would need all the money it could get the IMF agreed to enlarge the loan and disburse it more quickly The new plan called for an even smaller deficit and even tighter monetary policy At times the revised plan seemed to be working But a jump in inflation in early 2019 caught everyone by surprise And any remaining hopes of success were dashed when it became clear Mr Macri would lose that year election In its last months his government had to impose capital controls to stem capital flight The leftist government that succeeded his defaulted on the country foreign debtWhat kind of contingency plans should the fund have insisted on? The evaluation singles out an “early” debt restructuring in which the government would have asked its creditors to accept a delay or decrease in repayments coupled with capital controls to prevent money fleeing the country That would have eased Argentina debt burden And it might have left more IMF money for later helping bolster the country foreign-exchange reserves and rebuild confidence in the aftermath of the debt write-downOwn goalBut if such a plan had become public it would have rocked market confidence precipitating the damage it was designed to limit And it might also have violated the government “red lines” which ruled out such measures because it regarded them as a hallmark of Argentina uncreditworthy past The evaluation concedes that stabilisation plans do not work if governments do not feel they “own” them But “ownership” it says “should not be understood as a willingness to defer to [a government] preference for suboptimal policy choices” The IMF should not in other words let governments make their own mistakes with the fund moneyThe evaluation alludes indirectly to another implicit goal of the IMF in Argentina: to rescue its own dismal reputation in the country Had it insisted on an early debt restructuring coupled with capital controls it might have distanced itself further from its reputation for free-market fundamentalism But to have pressed such a plan on Argentina against the wishes of its democratically elected government would have entrenched its reputation for bossiness In the case of Argentina a less neoliberal approach would have been more neocolonial Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:New research counts the costs of the Sino-American trade war Jan 1stHas the pandemic shown inflation to be a fiscal phenomenon?

 Jan 8th 2022,How long can the global housing boom last?,NOVA SCOTIA’S largest city is known for a few things: a big national-security conference that takes place every autumn; a huge explosion that took place in 1917 causing immense devastation; and a small but impressive wine industry It may soon be known for something else Since December 2019 house prices in Halifax have risen by nearly 50% according to Knight Frank a property firma boom that only a tiny number of cities have bettered Sit down with a Haligonian and before long they will express bafflement at how their city became so priceyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLocal factors play a role Some people who had moved to distant Alberta to work in the oil industry lost their jobs in 2020 and moved back home Out-of-towners are investing in local property in the expectation that eastern Canada will become a more desirable place to live as the climate changes Nevertheless the broader trend is mirrored across much of the world see chart 1 The IMF global house-price index expressed in real terms is well above the peak reached before the 2007-09 financial crisis American housebuilders’ share prices are up by 44% over the past year compared with 27% for the overall stockmarket Estate agents from Halifax mom-and-pop shops to the supermodel look alikes on Netflix “Selling Sunset” in Los Angeles have never had it so goodNow people are wondering whether the party is about to end Governments are winding down stimulus People no longer have so much spare cash to splurge on property now that foreign holidays are back and restaurants are open Central banks worried about surging inflation are tightening monetary policy including by raising interest rates In its latest financial-stability report the IMF warned that “downside risks to house prices appear to be significant” and that if these were to materialise prices in rich countries could fall by up to 14% In New Zealand where prices have risen by 24% in the past year the central bank is blunter The “level of house prices” it says is “unsustainable”But is it? Certainly there is little evidence so far that the recent tightening in fiscal and monetary policy is provoking a slowdown In the third quarter of 2021 global house-price growth rose to an all-time high Although New Zealand central bank has raised interest rates by 05 percentage points since October there is only the mildest indication that house-price growth is slowing Property prices are still rising in the Czech Republic even though the central bank repeatedly raised rates in 2021Perhaps it is just a matter of time before the house of cards collapses But as a recent paper by Gabriel Chodorow-Reich of Harvard University and colleagues explains what might appear to be a housing bubble may in fact be the product of fundamental economic shifts The paper shows that the monumental house-price increases in America in the early to mid-2000s were largely a consequence of factors such as urban revitalisation growing preferences for city living and rising wage premia for educated workers in cities By 2019 American real house prices had pretty much regained their pre-financial-crisis peak further evidence that the mania of the mid-2000s was perhaps not quite so mad after allFundamental forces may once again explain why house prices today are so highand why they may endure Three of them stand out: robust household balance-sheets; people greater willingness to spend more on their living arrangements; and the severity of supply constraintsTake households first In contrast with some previous housing booms well-off folk with stable jobs have driven the surge in prices In America the average credit score for someone taking out a government-backed mortgage is around 750considered pretty good by most people standards and far higher than before the financial crisis In the euro area banks significantly tightened credit standards for mortgages in 2020 though they have undone that a little since then For many people getting a mortgage has become harder not easierPeople are also less vulnerable to rising interest ratesand thus less likely to be foreclosed on which often leads to fire-sales and drags down pricesthan you might think In part this is because rates are rising from a low base In America mortgage-debt-service payments take up about 37% of disposable income the lowest figure on record But it is also because other countries are following America down the fixed-rate-mortgage path which in the short term protects people against increases in borrowing costs In Germany long-term fixed products are twice as popular as they were a decade ago In Britain almost all new mortgages are fixed-rate with five-year deals now more common According to UK Finance a trade body nearly three-quarters of all mortgage borrowers will in the near term be unaffected by the Bank of England recent rate riseShifting preferences are the second reason why global house prices may stay high More people are working remotely meaning greater demand for at-home offices Others want larger gardens This race for space explains about half of the rise in British house prices during the pandemic according to analysis by the Bank of England Transactions involving detached homes have increased for instance while those for flats have declined Across the rich world household-saving rates still remain unusually high That may have allowed people to invest more in propertyThe third and most important reason why house prices could remain high is housing supply The Economist analysis of national statistics and archival records finds that in the years before the pandemic housebuilding in the rich world once adjusted for population had fallen to half its level of the mid-1960s see chart 2 Housing supply has become ever more “inelastic”: increases in demand for homes have translated more into higher prices and less into additional constructionIn many places the pandemic has dealt a further blow to supply During the first wave of covid-19 some governments forced builders to down their tools In the second quarter of 2020 Italian housing starts dropped by around 25%; in Britain they fell by half Even in places where stay-at-home orders were milder and zoning laws are loose such as Texas the pace of extra demand was so rapid that builders could not keep up slowed down for instance by the limited number of carpentersShortages of materials and labour have added to the constraints Builders are grappling with higher costs and delays for raw materials such as cement copper lumber and steel and a scarcity of tradespeople is pushing wages higher The bumper earnings and improved margins of some house builders suggests that many have been able to pass on cost increases to buyers DR Horton America largest home builder said the average sales price of its homes shot up by 14% in 2021 contributing to 78% growth in earnings per shareSome supply bottlenecks may now be easing In October the IMF noted that global housing starts per person had begun to pick up though they were still “considerably below the levels of the early 2000s” But the world has a long way to go In May 2021 researchers at Freddie Mac a “government-sponsored enterprise” which subsidises much of American mortgage finance estimated that the world largest economy faced a shortage of nearly 38m homes up from 25m in 2018 Other estimates put the shortfall closer to 55m In England an estimated 345000 new homes per year are needed to meet demand but builders are further away from the target than they have ever been Unless something profound changes pricey property may be around for a while yet For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 1st 2022,New research counts the costs of the Sino-American trade war,THE INITIAL two-year segment of the “phase one” trade deal between America and China comes to an end on December 31st Neither country is in a mood to mark the occasion Mutual antagonism is as fierce as ever; a new American law banning goods made with forced labour in Xinjiang is the latest flashpoint Still it is a good moment to take stock of the economic outcomes of the Sino-American trade war The verdict is unremittingly negative for both countrieswith one important exceptionListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKStart with the most glaring failure As part of the phase-one deal signed on January 15th 2020 China promised to import dramatically more from America by buying an additional $200bn in goods and services in 2020 and 2021 compared with 2017 levels Having long complained about China manipulation of its economy America demanded that it manipulate trade flows As it turns out Chinese officials lacked either the willingness or the ability to get it done China will reach barely a tenth of its purchase target for goods according to data compiled by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank Even allowing for pandemic-related disruptions America strategy of browbeating China into buying more of its wares has underwhelmedMore broadly the trade war has hurt both the Chinese and American economies as a growing body of research shows The superpowers started hitting each other with tariffs in early 2018 giving economists two full pre-covid years of numbers to crunch During that time average American tariffs on Chinese imports soared from 3% to 19% while average Chinese tariffs on American imports went from 8% to 21% It is hard to overstate how big a shock this was to the world biggest bilateral trading relationship Pablo Fajgelbaum of Princeton University and Amit Khandelwal of Columbia University calculate that the tariffs were applied to even more trade as a share of American GDP than were the notorious Smoot-Hawley levies of 1930 which led to a spiral of international retaliation and may have worsened the Depression Mercifully the Sino-American trade war has precipitated no such disaster The global economy was in much better shape to begin with And price effects have been muffled by complex supply chainsAt the onset of the trade war a common assumption was that both sides would bear the costs of the tariffs: Chinese suppliers would charge a little less for their goods and American importers would pay a bit more Yet an early study by economists including Gita Gopinath now of the IMF found that American importers in fact bore more than 90% of the cost of America tariffs The obvious explanation was that they had little choice but to rely on Chinese suppliers at least in the short run and could not negotiate lower prices In addition prices to consumers barely budged suggesting that retailers absorbed the costs through thinner profitsThis could not last wrote Ms Gopinath and her colleagues: at some point American importers would pass higher costs on to customers Chinese economists might gleefully point to America current surge in inflation to argue that this is now happening At the margin they are surely right that tariffs can be inflationary as even Janet Yellen America treasury secretary has conceded But dislocations stemming from the pandemicfrom microchip shortages to a quintupling of shipping costsare far bigger factors in driving up prices The trade war only adds to the headacheOne reason why America levied tariffs was to encourage manufacturers to relocate there Yet trade friction has in fact depressed business investment in America suggests research by Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and others The share prices of companies trading with China fared especially badly after tariff announcements This reflected lower returns to capital and by extension weaker incentives to invest All told the annual investment growth of listed American firms was likely to have shrunk by 19 percentage points by the end of 2020 Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve Board estimate that exposure to higher tariffs was associated with a decline in American manufacturing employment of 14% The burden of higher import costs and retaliatory levies outweighed the benefits of being sheltered from foreign competitionSo far all this might sound like a win for China But more recent papers show that it too has taken some blows Because of a lack of granular official Chinese data Davin Chor of the Tuck School of Business and Li Bingjing of the University of Hong Kong studied satellite images of night-time lights to gauge economic activity The bulk of China population they found would have been oblivious to the trade war But for the directly affected export-intensive parts of the country they estimated that the tariffs led to a 25% contraction in GDP per person Another approach by economists including Xu Mingzhi of Peking University was to look at data from 51jobcom a Chinese job platform Firms more exposed to American tariffs posted roughly 3% less ads in the six months following tariff increases and reduced salary offers by 05% on average Chinese officials like to talk about bilateral co-operation as “win-win” The trade war has been lose-loseEggs in more basketsThe trade war has been constructive in one respect however America imports from China are fractionally lower than before it implemented tariffs By contrast its imports from Vietnam have doubled and those from Mexico have risen by 20% Viewed narrowly this may be a sign that trade is being diverted from more efficient producers in China to slightly less efficient onesBut as a matter of business strategy this looks sensible One of the lessons of the supply-chain snarls of the past year is the danger of over-reliance on a single source American firms can thank the trade war for getting them started on the messy business of rethinking their supply chains The trajectory of Sino-American relations suggests they have every reason to hasten the shift Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Has the

 Jan 1st 2022,Why capital will become scarcer in the 2020s,THE TROUBLE with the 12-month outlook an obligation at this time of year is that the forecasts will be wrong Of course they will In financial markets there are so many ways to erron direction timing or speed of change A year is both too long and too short Too long because the blistering pace of the current financial-business cycle means even a well-identified idea plays out in a matter of weeks Too short because deep trends may take years to become fully apparentListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSo let us shelve the immediate outlook and ask instead how things might change over the next decade or so Today capital is abundant A middle-aged global workforce has lots of savings to put to work Low long-term interest rates and expensive assets point to a scarcity of worthwhile ways to deploy those savings New businesses are often ideas-based and do not need a lot of capital It can be hard to imagine this state of affairs ending But over time capital is bound to become less abundant Greater demand for it will come from three sources in particular: economic populism; shorter supply-chains; and the energy transitionStart with economic populism Thirty years ago two academic economists Sebastian Edwards and Rudiger Dornbusch sketched out its key elements Above all it is an approach that sees no constraintssuch as borrowing limits or inflationon economic growth The Latin American populists studied by the scholars printed money to pay for public-spending binges This ended badly But economic populism lives on It is in its purest form in Venezuela Turkey seems hell-bent on embracing a version of it Argentina never quite threw it offA diluted form of economic populism is becoming more evident in rich countries too One sign is a revival of discretionary fiscal policy The $19trn package signed in March by President Joe Biden is the crowning example The EU €750bn $900bn recovery fund is more modest but still significant Fiscal stimulus is back in favour because of a realisation that policy constraints such as budget deficits bind less when interest rates are low But over time deficit-financed spending will start to absorb excess savings There has also been a shift in monetary policy You see this in a change in targets and in personnel The old-style central bankeraloof from politics paranoid about inflationis all but extinct in the rich world A new breed frets about inequality and finds reasons to be sanguine about inflation risks Marko Papic of Clocktower Group an investment firm calls the shift towards stimulus the “Buenos Aires Consensus” in contrast with the Washington Consensus which counsels prudenceA second factor is rising investment in business continuity Global value chains are likely to shorten somewhat In part this is to avoid the bottlenecks that weighed on output in 2021 Even modest near-shoring will require more capital A general increase in working capital seems likely Companies lost sales during the pandemic for want of stock The interest cost of carrying inventory is now far lower than it was when business practice shifted towards lean stock levels and just-in-time supply A national-security imperative also favours greater redundancy in supply chains as Mr Papic points out Rivalry between America and China is leading each country to duplicate capacity in certain key industries such as semiconductors Such duplication will soak up capitalA third reason to expect capital scarcity is climate change The transition to greener energy is essentially a capital-spending problem argue Eric Lonergan and Corinne Sawers in a forthcoming book Any serious attempt to arrest the climb in the global temperature requires junking the assets underpinning the carbon economyoil rigs coal-fired power stations petrol forecourtsand building a new infrastructure based on electric vehicles wind and solar power and battery storage A lot of capital has to be deployed to create these assetsNone of these three trends is the kind that plays out fully over a calendar year Indeed such are the ironies of forecasting that 2022 may furnish evidence against the capital-scarcity thesis If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates it will do so quite early in the business cycle belying the idea of a populist policy tilt Mr Biden “Build Back Better” spending bill may gather dust As bottlenecks ease security of supply may slip down companies’ lists of priorities But today capital abundance cannot last for ever Wait long enough and some forecasts are almost bound to be rightFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Why the dollar ascendancy won’t last Dec 11th 2021Have SPACs been cleaned up?

 Jan 1st 2022,Is a greener faster and more decentralised alternative to Bitcoin possible?,CRYPTO IS THE key to paradise particularly the financial kind That at least is what the fans argue Greedy intermediaries such as banks will be replaced by smart contracts self-executing rules that run on blockchains distributed databases This will give rise to efficient and innovative financial services collectively called “decentralised finance” DeFiListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe foundations of this edifice are shaky however Today blockchains may be masterworks of coding but they are also fiendishly complex energy-hungry and perhaps counterintuitively centralised Despite years of work crypto developers are still trying to fully overcome the trade-offs inherent in the technologyYou can think of banks as maintaining big opaque databases that contain information on customers’ accounts and the money in them Depositors have to trust that these institutions act in their interests Sometimes however banks may not do so: they might make bad investments and collapse; or they might freeze depositors’ accounts at a government behestTo their proponents blockchains provide the basis for a type of finance that avoids such problems Account databases would be maintained not by a central authority but by the computers of those who use them An account could be frozen only if a certain majority of those maintaining the blockchain agrees to do soFor the system to work publicly accessible blockchains have two special features One is a “consensus mechanism” a way for users to agree on how to write new transactions in the database The other is a set of incentives that keeps the system alive Rewards need to draw in enough users to help maintain the blockchain And penalties have to dissuade them from attacking it say by mimicking lots of fake users in order to overwhelm the systemIn the case of the Bitcoin blockchain the carrot is newly minted coins Every ten minutes or so hundreds of thousands of specialised computers called “miners” participate in a lottery to solve a mathematical puzzle The computer that first finds a solution alerts the other miners and if they confirm the result it updates the blockchain and is paid every puzzle solved is rewarded with 625 coins which at the time of writing was worth $308270 The number-crunching also acts as a stick: the greater miners want their chances of winning the lottery to be the more they have to invest in computing gear and electricity To rewrite the blockchain in their favour say by faking a transaction they would have to control more than half the mining power Yet engineering such an attack would be expensive and would probably bring down the system they seek to profit fromThis approach called “proof of work” is simple as far as blockchains go and has yet to be really hacked But it has several big drawbacks For one it does not scale up Bitcoin can only handle up to seven transactions per second and fees can be high The system has also developed some forms of centralisation Most puzzle-solving is done by a few big “pools” These allow miners to combine their resources and increase the odds of winning the reward but also give them the power to influence the evolution of the system as changes are often put to a vote of sorts Furthermore proof of work guzzles energy According to some estimates Bitcoin electricity use is approaching that of ItalyPower hunger and centralisation follow from the increasing returns to scale of proof of work These push miners to keep expanding The more computing power they have the higher the chance that they win a reward The bigger they are the more they earn and the more they can expandHence the quest to come up with better blockchains Chia for instance is a system based on “proof of space and time” As with Bitcoin the carrot is that participating users earn coins Yet the stick is different: instead of wasting computing power Chia wastes digital storage It is not yet clear though whether Chia will prove more sustainable and less centralised than Bitcoin if it becomes widely usedThe smart digital money is therefore on another approach: proof of stake Here decisions about updating the blockchain are made not through a computing arms race but by a vote among the holders of a cryptocurrency Voting power as well as the share of the rewards depend on how much holders are willing to bet on the outcome This stake can be destroyed if a participant misbehaves In this system both carrot and stick are the cryptocurrency itselfProof of stake does use much less energy And its latest incarnations are much faster than Bitcoin: Avalanche a blockchain that uses the approach processes thousands of transactions a second But it still has big problems Coders have been attempting to shift Ethereum the preferred blockchain for DeFi apps from proof of work to proof of stake Even Vitalik Buterin one of the inventors of Ethereum admits that proof of stake is “surprisingly complex” That means that lots can go wrong especially when nearly $100bn in capital in DeFi apps must switch over After several delays the coders hope to make the move in 2022Yet this system would still tend towards centralisation Bigger holders can reap more rewards increasing their holdings further This concentrates power among early buyers of a cryptocurrency and could allow them to take control of the blockchain Newer projects that use proof of stake are trying to find ways to avoid this Hedera Hashgraph is governed by a consortium much like the one that runs Visa a credit-card network Avalanche and Tezos seek to ensure decentralisation by making it easy for “validators” participants who maintain the blockchain to joinTo critics centralisation is inevitable even if energy inefficiency and complexity are not The problem of increasing returns to scale will raise its head for any popular blockchain predicts David Rosenthal an early practitioner “You waste all these resources only to end up with a system that is controlled by people you have even less reason to trust than those who run conventional financial institutions” he saysTo others a degree of centralisation may simply be a price to pay for the other advantages of blockchains Emin Gün Sirer of Cornell University who co-founded Ava Labs which created Avalanche says that the main benefit is that governments will find it harder to influence blockchains than they do conventional banks Kevin Werbach of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania says that the openness of blockchains makes it easier to develop

 Jan 1st 2022,Which economies have done best and worst during the pandemic?,THE SPEED of the economic bounce-back from the enormous recession of 2020 has taken many forecasters by surprise Output across the 38 mostly rich OECD countries combined probably surpassed its pre-pandemic level a few months ago The average unemployment rate across the club at 57% is in line with the post-war average And aggregate household income adjusted for inflation is above its pre-covid level The overall picture has been remarkably benign even as several variants of the coronavirus have emerged But it hides stark differences beneath The pandemic has created winners and losersand the dispersion between them is likely to persist in 2022Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn order to assess these differences The Economist has gathered data on five economic and financial indicatorsGDP household incomes stockmarket performance capital spending and government indebtednessfor 23 rich countries We have ranked each economy according to how well it has performed on each measure creating an overall score the table below shows the overall ranking and four of our five indicators Some countries remain in the economic pits while others are faring better than they were before the pandemic on almost every measure Denmark Norway and Sweden are all near the top and America has also performed reasonably well Many big European countries however such as Britain Germany and Italy have fared worse Spain has done worst of allThe change in headline GDP since the end of 2019 our first indicator offers a snapshot of economic health Some countries always looked vulnerable to travel bans and a collapse in services spendingin particular those in southern Europe which rely heavily on tourism Other places including Belgium and Britain suffered high levels of covid-19 infections and deaths which limited consumer spendingGranular data help fill in the picture The change in household income gives a sense of how well families have done as it includes not just earnings from employment but also handouts from governments Our measure is in real terms which adjusts for reduced purchasing power as a result of recent surges in inflationIn some countries especially those where the impact of the virus was relatively slight labour markets did not suffer too much allowing people to continue to earn Japan unemployment rate has barely budged since the pandemic began By contrast Spain rate rose by three percentage points between February and August 2020Some governments more than made up for people lost labour income by sending them vast amounts of money That was America strategy: although unemployment soared as the economy locked down households received more than $2trn in government transfers in 2020 and 2021 in the form of topped-up unemployment benefits and stimulus cheques Canada did something similar Other countries however such as the Baltics focused their fiscal firepower on protecting firms’ cashflow or expanding health-care capacity Austria and Spain seemed neither to preserve jobs nor compensate the losers: in both countries real household income is still around 6% below its pre-pandemic levelWhat about companies? Stockmarket performance hints at their health as well as a country attractiveness to foreign investors Share prices in Britain are slightly lower today than on the eve of the pandemica reflection perhaps of Brexit-induced uncertainty Britain also hosts fewer companies in the higher-growth sectors that have benefited from pandemic-induced technology adoption and lower interest rates America which has more such firms has seen its stockmarket jump But it has nothing on the bourses of northern Europe where prices have soared Three of the ten biggest firms by market capitalisation on the Danish market are in health care decent stocks to hold in a pandemicCapital spending our fourth measure provides a gauge of businesses’ optimism about the future Some countries are in the middle of a capex boom: in America for instance entrepreneurs are spotting opportunities created by the pandemic and companies are spending big on technologies that make working from home more efficient In October Goldman Sachs a bank forecast that S&P 500 companies would spend 18% more on capex and research and development in 2022 than they did in 2019 Investment in some other places by contrast is more sedate Norway has seen cuts to oil-and-gas capexOur last indicator is public indebtedness All else equal a big rise in government debt is worse than a small one since it could indicate potentially larger tax rises and spending cuts in the future Not every country has amassed enormous debts during the pandemic even if America Britain Canada and others certainly have Swedish public debt has risen by just six percentage points as a share of GDP This is a reflection perhaps of the fact that the country largely avoided strict lockdowns necessitating less fiscal supportThe spread of the Omicron variant is likely to curtail growth in early 2022 But the economic recovery is still likely to continue over the year and the overall picture will probably mask variation again The OECD expects some of the worst performers to start catching up: Italy is forecast to grow by 46% in 2022 above the average pace for the club of 39%But the laggards have a long way to go By the end of next year the OECD expects the combined GDP of our three highest-ranked countries to be 5% higher than its pre-pandemic level Output for the three worst performers meanwhile is expected to be just 1% higher than it was before covid-19 The uneven effects of the pandemic in other words will endure Correction 31st December 2021: An earlier version of the table showed data for a selection of 11 countries It has now been expanded to show all 23 countries We have also corrected errors in the calculations for Japan's household income and Greece's public debt This has led to small changes to the ranking compared with that shown in the original table America and Canada have each moved up a place to 9th and 10th respectively and Japan has gone from equal 20th to 21st SorryFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Jan 1st 2022,What real-time indicators suggest about Omicron economic impact,WHAT IS THE economic impact of Omicron? The latest variant of the coronavirus has let rip at such a ferocious pace that forecasters are still catching their breath and it will be some time before its economic effects become apparent in the official data which are published with a lag But a number of speedier albeit partial indicators can provide some insight into how consumers and workers may be adjusting their behaviourListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKConsider first people willingness to go out and about A mobility index using real-time data from Google and constructed by The Economist includes visits to workplaces retail and recreation sites and transport hubs This measure has been reasonably stable in America albeit at levels below pre-pandemic norms and has fallen a little in Britain and Germany in recent days But underlying those headline figures are bigger differences depending on the kind of activity The return to the office seems to have stalled In America and Germany journeys to workplaces fell to about 25% and 16% below pre-pandemic levels respectively in the week to December 23rd In Britain where the government has issued guidance to work from home they were 30% lower see chart 1 By contrast retail- and recreation-related activity has continued to recover in all three countries This suggests that people may have become more discriminating about when to leave the house especially as the festive season began It might also indicate that people who can easily work from home were doing so a sign of the economy increased adaptability to new variantsOther measures show that the hospitality industry is taking a knock Fewer people are eating at restaurants than in 2019 according to data from OpenTable a booking platform In America and Britain there were 12-15% fewer diners in the week to December 20th than in the same period in 2019 see chart 2Omicron also seems to have contributed to travel disruptions That has been most notable in America and China where domestic air travel had more or less returned to normal In the week to December 26th some 3500 domestic and international flights that started or finished in America were cancelled according to FlightAware a data firmabout 25% of the total number of flights That compares with a cancellation rate of 07% in the same week in 2019 American airlines have blamed covid-related staff shortages and bad weather for the cancellations The number of passengers passing through American airports on December 22nd and 23rd slightly exceeded that in the same period in 2019 But only 32m made journeys on the 24th and 25th compared with more than 5m in 2019These indicators give only a limited view of the economy But they may well capture the areas that are most likely to be affected by fresh outbreaks of covid-19 Analysts at Moody a rating agency have revised down their estimates of growth in America in early 2022 partly because of reduced spending on travel Economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics a consultancy expect the pain in Britain to be concentrated in the hospitality entertainment and travel industries while other sectors remain unaffected That points to a smaller overall economic impact this time round compared with previous waves But with infections still surging and governments pondering fresh restrictions on activity the full effect of Omicron could be yet to come As covid-19 enters its third year every forecaster knows by now to brace for the unexpected For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 22nd 2021,Five financial surprises in 2021,EVERY YEAR comes with its own unexpected twists for financial markets but 2021 has been jam-packed with them Here are some of the developments that took investors companies and analysts most by surprise this year and what they mean for 2022 Supply-chain disruptionsPaul Samuelson a Nobel-prizewinning economist once joked that the stockmarket had predicted nine of the last five recessions A similar charge could have been levelled against the analysts who regularly fretted about major supply-chain disruptionsuntil now The onset of the pandemic in early 2020 was strikingly free of serious snarls beyond the fact that personal-protective equipment was in short supply for a time By contrast this year has been marked by extensive shortages and surging supply-driven inflation Drewry a supply-chain consultancy constructs a measure of the average cost of shipping a 40-foot container across a range of routes This reached a peak of $10377 in late September quadruple the level a year earlierDisruptions to factories and ports in China and South-East Asia driven by governments’ efforts to smother covid-19 outbreaks did not help matters But the lion share of the tumult can be attributed to explosive demand for physical products: spending on durable goods has risen by 34% in America since the beginning of 2020 compared with an increase of nearer 4% on services As the pandemic recedes that gap should narrow But supply chains may remain squeezed for some time relative to pre-covid norms Chinese markets upturnedThe established order in Chinese financial markets was upended this year too For the best part of a decade investors clamoured for greater access to Chinese assets with the country booming tech sector regarded as particularly alluring But a regulatory crackdown in 2021 has left the MSCI China Tech 100 share-price index down by nearly a third since the beginning of the year The stock price of Alibaba an e-commerce giant has fallen by almost 50% over the same periodEvergrande a huge property developer had long been the most extreme symbol of China heavily leveraged real-estate sector In 2021 it at last defaulted in the face of a government effort to throttle borrowing by developers How the regulatory campaigns proceed depends on China opaque politics which will be dominated by the Communist Party Congress towards the end of 2022 But the shakedown of both the tech and property sectors has made clear that investment performance in China can still turn on a dime if the government mood shifts The earnings bonanzaAnalysts and investors expected a revival in earnings in 2021after all things could hardly have been worse than last year But the scale of the recovery has beaten almost all projections In late December 2020 the consensus expectation was for a 22% increase in earnings per share on the S&P 500 America benchmark stock index in 2021 Fourth-quarter earnings are still to be announced but the estimate for growth in the year as a whole is now 45% stronger even than the 40% rise in 2010 after the global financial crisis This is partly down to a faster economic recovery than expected with companies’ earnings surpassing not just their 2020 levels but their 2019 levels tooThat puts stockmarkets in a more difficult spot as 2022 begins: some of the economic recovery that had previously been expected to take place next year may already have happened Analysts expect a much more muted rise in the earnings of S&P 500 companies of 9% Beating forecasts by a large margin again next year will be a tall order And with the index still priced at more than 20 times expected earnings that might limit how far prices can rise Public v privateFor much of 2020 bankers moaned about the difficulties of operating in a pandemic But if the fewer physical meetings with clients the lack of roadshows for initial public offerings and the uncertainty of the economic outlook have had deleterious effects they are hard to find in the data In the first 11 months of the year listings in America raised $1478bn more than twice the amount raised in the same period in 2020 Although the surge was most pronounced in the early months of the year activity is still buoyant as 2021 draws to a closeThe boom casts some doubt over the idea that public markets are being inexorably supplanted by private capital The power of banks over the listing process may be ebbing as companies going public can now opt for direct listings or mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs So far in the fourth quarter 621 companies have gone public worldwideincluding through SPACsa 16% increase over the past year The wave of flotations suggests public markets are not out for the count Green financeExecutives and investors keen to appear environmentally friendly have sometimes been objects of derision in recent years and green finance in general has been regarded with often justified scepticism But this year has seen concrete developments Green government bonds have flooded the market with at least 20 countries issuing such debt this year In mid-October the European Union issued its first green bond selling €12bn-worth $136bn to enthusiastic investors Perhaps the most interesting developments have come from the private sector though Investment in climate-tech startups reached $60bn in the first half of 2021 more than triple that in the same period last year There has been a huge surge of investor interest in electric-vehicle firms from Tesla to CATL the world leading battery-maker Meanwhile in May ExxonMobil lost a proxy battle against activist investors who voted more climate-friendly directors to the oil firm board And the oil majors are among the companies exploring hydrogen technologiesFinance will struggle to be truly green without a widespread carbon price But the sector emerges from 2021 looking more mature and serious than when the year

 Dec 18th 2021,The hidden costs of cutting Russia off from SWIFT,FOR WEEKS Russia has been massing troops and tanks near the Ukrainian border Neither talks with nor threats from the West have stemmed the flow With America and its allies loth to commit forces another option is gaining prominence: cutting Russia off from SWIFT the messaging network used by 11000 banks in 200 countries to make cross-border payments Flicking a switch seems safer than putting boots on the ground But it could have dangerous consequencesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA first hurdle would be getting SWIFT to comply The co-operative of banks based in Belgium vows to be politically neutral Many European countries such as Germany do a lot of business with Russia and may oppose the plan But there is a precedent In 2018 America managed to force SWIFT to ditch Iranian banks even in the face of European resistance America would probably have its way again It could threaten to pull its own banks from SWIFT or to seize infrastructure vital to the network such as a data centre in Virginia In 2020 it used similar threats to force SITA a network of global airlines based in Switzerland to disconnect carriers from countries facing American sanctionsBut would excluding Russia from SWIFT actually be worthwhile? There are three reasons to think that it might not It would harm but not cripple Russia; it would impose costs on the West; and it would be counterproductive in the long runStart with the impact on Russia The no-SWIFT scenario is not new to Moscow It has been bracing itself since 2014 when America first raised the idea of unplugging it from the network to punish it for invading Crimea cooler heads eventually prevailed If Russia were excluded today capital flight and a run on firms and banks reliant on foreign funding would ensue But coping mechanisms would then kick in Russian banks and their foreign partners would use other means of communication such as telex phone and email Transactions would migrate en masse to SPFS a Russian alternative to SWIFT that is not nearly as ubiquitous and sophisticated but still usable As the payments infrastructure struggled at first to cope Russia would suffer some disruptionbut not disaster Over time investment in SPFS would make the system speedierMeanwhile the West would suffer blowback Until now America has aimed its financial firepower at small or isolated countries such as Cuba Iran and Myanmar Russia is twice the combined size of any economy America has ever embargoed Any disruption in Russia would spill over to the countries that have business dealings with it It is the EU fifth-largest trading partner for instance And European banks have $56bn-worth of claims on Russian residents There would also be indirect damage through retaliation Iran in 2018 had a weak hand But Russia is the source of 35% of Europe gas supply and is home to €310bn $350bn of EU assetsIn the long run America too would bear costs It holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems Any country with uneasy relations with America would seek alternatives to SWIFT while Europe might redouble its efforts to develop a more independent payments network Weaponising SWIFT against Russia would be seen by China as a “dress rehearsal” says Adam Smith a former American sanctions official now at Gibson Dunn a law firm It would provide China with the impetus to bolster CIPS its rival to SWIFT just as America other foes look for alternatives The network which already counts some big foreign banks as members allows messages to be transmitted in both Chinese and English Its daily average volume of transactions of 310bn yuan $50bn remains well behind SWIFT estimated $400bn but it has nearly doubled in the past year Should it reach scale America financial dominance would be threatenedOther weapons of economic disruption exist America could for example blacklist big Russian financial institutions preventing its own banks from dealing with them That would probably be as disruptive for Russia as a disconnection from SWIFT without undermining the global financial architecture as much Yet the risk of immediate blowback would remain That highlights a long-standing dilemma of wielding economic sanctions: although they are cheap when aimed at puny states bigger targets can hit back says Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute a think-tank The West still has powder left But it must choose its battles wisely For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 18th 2021,Has the pandemic shown inflation to be a fiscal phenomenon?,HERE IS A potted history of recent economic policy and inflation In the 2010s central banks created vast amounts of money through their quantitative-easing QE schemes while governments enacted fiscal austerity Inflation in the rich world was mostly too low undershooting central banks’ targets Then the pandemic struck There was plenty more QE But the truly novel economic policy was the $108trn in fiscal stimulus implemented worldwide equivalent to 10% of global GDP The result was high inflation The rich country that has splurged the most America has had the most inflation With consumer prices rising at an annual pace of 68% the Federal Reserve on December 15th was forced to acknowledge that inflation had become a big threatListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt first glance this apparent supremacy of fiscal policy is awkward for fans of Milton Friedman view that inflation is “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” Central banks not governments are charged with hitting inflation targets But does the experience of the pandemic show that inflation is really fiscal?One way in which fiscal stimulus boosts inflation is by strengthening households’ and firms’ balance-sheets making them more likely to spend Suppose the government raises cash from investors who receive bonds in exchange Then it hands out the money to households returning it into circulation Netting off it is as if the government has just given out new bonds Whether those bonds truly constitute new wealth for the private sector is the subject of an old theoretical debate When the government runs up debts the public could also expect to pay higher taxes in the futurea liability that offsets their newly created assets Yet in reality it is clear that fiscal stimulus leads to more spendingNow introduce a new step into the thought experiment The central bank implementing QE creates new money with which it buys the bonds that the government has given out So when you net everything off the government is not giving out bonds It is giving out cash This is not far off the policy mix during the pandemic The tsunami of fiscal stimulus was accompanied by bond-buying of almost equal magnitude: central banks in America Britain the euro zone and Japan have together bought more than $9trn in assets The result has been a surge in deposits at commercial banks In America they have risen from around $135trn in early 2020 to around $18trn today As early as the spring of 2020 some monetarist economists such as Tim Congdon of the University of Buckingham pointed to surging measures of broad money which includes bank deposits and warned of inflation to followSo far so Friedmanite But which leg of the policy matters more: the fiscal stimulus which boosted aggregate household wealth or QE which ensured the infusion was of cash and not of bonds? There is probably something special about infusing households’ balance-sheets with cash says Chris Marsh of Exante Data a research firm He has suggested that a “rediscovery” of monetarism could be in the offing after the pandemicOther economists however argue that QE is mostly ineffective except in periods of acute financial stress such as the “dash for cash” in spring 2020 Suppose that once that crisis had passed central banks had shrunk their balance-sheets quickly but had still promised to keep interest rates at zero for a long time It seems likely that America enormous fiscal stimulus would by boosting household wealth still have driven up spending and pricesYet believing in the impotence of QE compared with fiscal stimulus is in fact consistent with monetarismif you expand the definition of money Distinguishing the electronic money created by central banks from debt securities issued by governments is increasingly difficult This is partly because when interest rates are close to zero they are closer substitutes It is also because most central banks now pay interest on the electronic money they create Even if rates were to rise so-called “interest on reserves” would still leave electronic money looking a bit like public debtThe reverse is also true Investors value government debt especially America for its liquidity meaning they are willing to hold it at a lower interest rate than other investmentsmuch like the public is willing to accept a low yield on bank deposits As a result “it seems more accurate to view the national debt less as a form of debt and more as a form of money in circulation” wrote David Andolfatto of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis in December 2020 He also warned Americans to “prepare themselves for a temporary burst of inflation” in light of the one-off increase in national debt during the pandemic If money and debt are substitutes just swapping one for another as QE does might provide little stimulus consistent with the experience of the 2010s But expanding their combined supply can be powerfully inflationaryRight on the moneyThe logical extreme of this argument is known as the “fiscal theory of the price level” created in the early 1990s and in the process of being refreshed: John Cochrane of Stanford University has written a 637-page book on the subject This says that the outstanding stock of government money and debt is a bit like the shares of a company Its valueie how much it can buyadjusts to reflect future fiscal policy Should the government be insufficiently committed to running surpluses to repay its debts the public will be like shareholders expecting a dilution The result is inflationExplaining today high inflation does not require you to go that far though It is enough to look at recent deficits rather than to peer into the future Yet it is striking that economists like Mr Andolfatto who focused on the supply of government liabilities foresaw today predicament while most central bankers whose eyes were fixed firmly on labour markets as a gauge of inflationary pressure did not The past decade has shown that when interest rates fall to zero it takes more than just QE to escape a low-inflation world Still Friedmanism lives on For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 18th 2021,After a shocker in 2021 where might inflation go in 2022?,THE ONLY thing that proved transitory about inflation in America in 2021 was the consensus that it would subside The left-hand chart shows that analysts consistently revised up their predictions trailing reality Consumer prices are now rising by nearly 7% compared with a year earlier the fastest pace since 1982 What does the future hold? The right-hand chart presents two scenarios In the first month-on-month inflation immediately falls back to its pre-pandemic trajectory Even so it would take until the end of 2022 for annual inflation to slow to the 2% pace that used to be the norm In the second case consumer prices rise at the same monthly clip seen over the past year Annual inflation would soar to nearly 8% in February and stay elevated Either way one prediction seems rock-solid: the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates in 2022 as the central bank itself indicated on December 15thListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 16th 2021,The Bank of England surprises investors by raising interest rates,THE BANK OF ENGLAND has sprung its second surprise in as many months In November it failed to raise interest rates after it had steered markets to expect an increase On December 16th it did raise rates after all surprising investorsdespite the most obvious change in the economic outlook being a worsening of the pandemic The bank monetary-policy committee voted by a margin of eight to one to raise interest rates from 01% to 025% That makes Britain the first big rich economy to experience interest-rate rises since the pandemic struck A defence of the Bank of England toing-and-froing would start with the argument that now is an exceptionally tricky time to be doing its job The global economy has been battered by a series of unusual shocks With the state of the economy so uncertain investors should not expect clear predictions about the path of policy Indeed the minutes of the bank meeting said that the decision was “finely balanced” The motivation for the rate rise is in part a worry that uncomfortably high inflation might stick The bank decision came a day after the publication of inflation figures for November Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 51% higher than economists had expected and well above the bank target of 2% The bank expects inflation to stay at around 5% throughout most of the winter peaking at 6% or so in April 2022 Although it saw few signs of inflation expectations spiralling out of control it saw signs of “greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures” Moreover there are indications that Britain labour market is making a rapid recovery The latest data show that it has shrugged off the end of the country furlough scheme with little fuss Wages are growing faster than they were before the pandemic and unemployment has fallen more quickly than expected Maintaining very loose monetary policy could therefore risk juicing up an economy already at full capacity fuelling future price rises that would be painful to bring under controlThe main surprise was not the fact that the Bank of England chose to raise interest ratesin November it had said that it would do so “over coming months” Instead it was the timing Britain is in the throes of an enormous wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant of covid-19 To be sure that could exacerbate inflation problems if it means that people continue to splash their cash on goods rather than services in turn extending retailers’ supply-chain woes But if fiscal support is not forthcoming confidence takes a knock and spending slumps inflation could start to flag Although successive waves of the virus have caused decreasing damage to the British economy this one could buck that trend if vaccines prove less effective at stopping its spread Silvana Tenreyro the lone dissenter on the committee pointed out that Britain economy was still smaller than it had been before the pandemic Although the new variant could raise inflationary pressures she argued there were scenarios in which sticking with rock-bottom interest rates would be best The Bank of England has been more hawkish than other big central banks like the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank On December 15th the Fed indicated that it would start raising interest rates next year The ECB which met on the same day as the Bank of England announced a reduction in its overall asset purchases but gave no hint that interest-rate rises were imminent The Bank of Japan which met on December 17th stood pat on rates The obvious risk is that by being the first to raise them the Bank of England has to change course if the recovery falters There could be more surprises to come For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 16th 2021,China property slowdown sheds light on another worrying debt problem,WHEN OFFICIALS in the southern city of Liuzhou began a routine auction of parcels of land in June they found few takers Only one of five plots received a bid; the rest went unsold As in many cities across China a downturn in the property market has meant less demand for the land on which apartment towers are builtListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat is bad news for local governments which rely on the sales for the bulk of their revenues It is also a troubling sign for the holders of bonds issued by local-government financing vehicles LGFVs the half-public half-corporate concoctions that have become a cornerstone of Chinese development Cities’ land-sale revenues are often used to repay these bonds After the auctions flopped in Liuzhou rating agencies downgraded two of the city LGFVs on fears that the government would struggle to service their debtsLGFVs are one of China oddest financial innovations In the mid-1990s the central government implemented budget laws to stop local bureaucrats building up massive debts In response regional governments crafted LGFVs as a workaround The vehicles which number in the thousands became important drivers of economic growth helping build bridges homes and roads They also became one of China biggest kinds of liabilities building up some 53trn yuan $83trn or 52% of GDP in onshore and offshore debts according to Goldman Sachs a bank Although such borrowing does not appear on public balance-sheets local authorities are responsible for paying it back The runaway debts now threaten to throw the financial system into turmoilThe central government has spent years trying to reform China shadow financial system but debts that are hidden off balance-sheets have been slow to shrink Take shadow banking for instance Although it has declined as a share of banking-system assets outstanding shadow loans remain high at 576trn yuan at the end of September Similarly a municipal-bond market now lets cities and provinces raise funds Yet LGFV debts at the end of 2020 still exceeded outstanding central and local government bonds combinedMany LGFVs make meagre earnings on the bridges roads and water systems they build Officials used to be able to make up the shortfall with land-sale revenues but this is becoming harder In a round of sales this year for 22 of China biggest cities the premium fetched on parcels was just 47% above the government reserve price compared with 167% earlier in the year according to Enodo Economics a research firm The default of Evergrande a developer with $300bn in liabilities and wider malaise in the property industry means demand for land could continue to suffer New home prices fell for a third consecutive month in November according to figures published on December 15thNo LGFV has yet defaulted on a bond But many market-watchers such as Larry Hu of Macquarie a bank believe it is only a matter of time The vehicles will face repayments of offshore bonds of $322bn in 2022 up from $269bn in 2021 reckons Nomura a Japanese bank Many of them issue short-term debt simply to pay off other maturities Guangxi Liuzhou Dongcheng an LGFV that was downgraded by S&P a rating agency in October had 257bn yuan $4bn in short-term maturities for instance An average of 60% of LGFV bond issuance has gone not to new growth-generating projects but towards paying off maturing debts in 2020 and 2021Many local governments appear to be preparing for a financial storm Liuzhou has used an estimated 20bn yuan in public funds to make up a capital shortfall at Dongtong Investment and Development Group a vehicle that was downgraded in August by Fitch another rating agency An LGFV in the city of Chongqing defaulted on bankers’ acceptance bills in March Subsidiaries of a provincial vehicle in Guangxi have gone bankrupt Provincial governments in Jiangsu and Yunnan have issued guidelines calling for collapsing LGFVs to go into formal bankruptcy instead of being hidden under more debtSuch reforms will not come easily The value of onshore LGFV bonds stood at 119trn yuan in June six times those issued by developers and a tenth of China onshore-bond market see chart A slight shift in sentiment towards the government implicit guarantee for LGFVs could roil markets This was highlighted by the caution around “Document No 15” an internal circular issued by the banking regulator in July which told lenders to cut access to working-capital loans for some LGFVs If upheld the new rules could have caused a cash crunch for the vehiclessimilar to the squeeze that brought down Evergrande But they were quickly abandoned Letting LGFVs fail is a line the central government is not yet willing to crossThe situation illustrates the market-distorting power of missed reforms Many other sectors such as property and non-core state-owned enterprises are no longer seen as backed by the central government The fact that the authorities did not decisively end their implicit support for LGFVs earlier this year has led many asset managers in China to consider them safe LGFV bond yields have fallen towards those on

 Dec 16th 2021,The private-markets party reaches fever pitch,THE BEST pauses in music are those that are least expected As a banging tune rises in a crescendo just a second of silence followed by a return of the beat can send a dance floor wild Such is the effect covid-19 has had on private markets In March 2020 when lockdowns sent DJs home everywhere the beat suddenly stopped But the pause did not last: after a tepid 2020 this year has been positively riotous “To call it a boom feels like an understatement” says Marcus Frampton of APFC Alaska sovereign-wealth fundListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAll manner of records are being broken In the first 11 months of 2021 private-equity PE firms sealed over 13000 deals globally worth a combined $18trnmore than in any previous full year Private buyers have bought or are eyeing up Sydney airport Italy phone company the French football league and Saudi Arabia pipelines Private-capital firmswhich include PE shops as well as funds that target credit infrastructure and propertyhave raised $11trn from end-investors this year not far off the highest-ever annual tally see chart 1 The boom is pushing up pay to even more extraordinary levels On December 10th KKR a buy-out firm announced long-term share awards that could net its two new co-chief executives more than $1bn eachPrivate assets were once so obscure they were called “alternatives” The label seems absurd today Private-capital firms manage a record $10trn of assets the equivalent of 10% of total assets globally see chart 2 This includes several types of activity PEwhich consists of taking over companies using debt juicing up profits and reselling them at a premiumpromises racy returns Infrastructure and to some extent property help diversify portfolios Private credit lends to smallish firms with a relatively high default risk earning attractive yieldsThe boom this year reflects both wider exuberance as well as the culmination of a structural shift in finance In order to meet their future liabilities institutional investors such as pension funds must achieve annual returns of 6-7% With interest rates at rock-bottom levels they piled into private assets where it is argued returns are more attractive Using data from Preqin The Economist calculates that the world biggest 25 investors by assets under managementincluding pension funds insurers and sovereign funds that together manage $22trnnow hold 9% of their assets in private markets twice the share in 2011 see chart 3 Australia Future Fund a sovereign-wealth pot of $142bn allocates 35% of its portfolio to them; CDPQ a pension fund in Quebec nearly 55%With capital markets open for initial public offerings a virtuous circle of activity is taking place: private-capital firms can sell more of their existing assets to another buyer or by listing them and return the proceeds to their ultimate investors who in turn are keen to participate in fresh fund raising for private markets For Blackstone for example the biggest firm of all asset sales cash returned and funds raised so far this year have all been roughly double the level of 2020 Greater deal “velocity” means asset managers are deploying capital faster and raising funds more often says Kelly DePonte of Probitas a firm that markets such funds to end-investorsThe belief that private returns will be superior reflects a variety of contestable arguments: that investors can earn an “illiquidity premium” for having money locked up in assets that do not trade freely say or that private markets are less efficient than public ones allowing skilled managers to exhibit consistent outperformance Sceptics think that opaque private markets allow managers to mask high leverage and volatility For now the magic formula is working Some big investors report annual returns in the mid-teens across private-asset classes this year with those on PE above 50% By comparison the S&P 500 an index of American stocks has produced a return of 24%Lured by high returns some investors are keen to be more directly involved in running private assets rather than being passive customers of the big private-capital managers APG a Dutch pension manager that oversees $703bn aims to own at least 10-15% of every fund it backs so as to negotiate veto rights over strategic matters says Patrick Kanters its private-markets boss Many big limited partners also “co-invest” alongside funds directly in portfolio companies which allows them more discretion over the size of their exposure and lowers overall fees Some bypass managers entirely Co- and direct investments are set to reach $265bn this year the highest-ever amount by far Large investors in “real” assets which include property and infrastructure have become full-fledged developers enabling them to create their own pipeline of dealswhether for student housing or hospitalsand pocket a fat marginChanging the tuneYet the scale of the boom is also a source of unease Valuations are creeping up In a survey of 71 global institutions carried out by Probitas this autumn 65% ranked unhealthy competition for deals as the biggest risk up from 55% last year Frenetic activity means less due diligence Limited partners as the ultimate investors in funds are known have little time to forge relationships with new managers and diversify their bets Some are recruiting more staff triggering what Maxime Aucoin of CDPQ calls a “war for talent” Meanwhile managers are feeling rushed too “Decisions are being made on bigger dollars in fewer days” notes Steve Moseley of APFC The amount of “dry power” the total committed to funds but not yet spent stands at a record $33trn The pressure to deploy capital means fund managers have less incentive to evaluate potential targets strictly or to turn down dealsAlongside frothy behaviour the other risks are the economy and interest rates For now a roaring American recovery means that the underlying performance of the firms and assets that private managers own is decent In November for example Blackstone told investors that for the first time ever every one of the companies that it owned was experiencing growing revenues Rising interest rates are a concern however as they can deflate asset prices impose stress on indebted companies and make it harder to raise debt to finance deals So far the Federal Reserve pivot towards tightening monetary policy has not roiled credit markets: junk-bond yields a proxy for interest rates on riskier debt have risen from 4% in September to 45% now But there could be more to comeFlush with cash amid a deal frenzy what is the industry to do?

 Dec 11th 2021,Why the demographic transition is speeding up,AS BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS go it was momentous On November 24th India government declared that the country fertility rate had dropped to 20 children per woman That is below the replacement rateat which new births are sufficient to maintain a steady populationand puts India in the company of many richer economies Indeed fertility rates are now below replacement level in all four “ BRIC” countries Brazil Russia India and China with the population probably falling in Russia and China It is no surprise that emerging economies should follow a demographic trajectory similar to that travelled by rich economies before them But the pace of change seems to be accelerating with potentially profound implications for the global economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhat social scientists refer to as the “demographic transition” has long been an essential feature of economic modernisation In pre-industrial societies both birth and death rates annual births and deaths per 1000 people were very high and overall population growth was uneven and slow But in the 18th century death rates in parts of north-west Europe began to decline marking the first stage of a seismic demographic shift Falling death rates led to rapid population growth; Britain population roughly doubled between 1760 and 1830 Yet from the late 18th century fertility rates began to decline as well By the 20th century birth and death rates in rich countries stabilised at low levels leading to slow or even negative population growth in the absence of immigrationTransitions are complex social phenomena Falling death rates are easiest to explain as the product of improved nutrition medicine and public health Falling birth rates are in part a response to economic incentives As the return to skill increases for example families seem to have fewer children in order to invest more in each child education But culture matters too In a recent paper Enrico Spolaore of Tufts University and Romain Wacziarg of the University of California Los Angeles note that in Europe new fertility norms first emerged in France in the late 18th and early 19th century The fashion for fewer births was probably rooted both in changes in outlook associated with secularism and the Enlightenment and in the spread of information about family planning As birth rates fell across Europe they did so faster and earlier in places with linguistic and cultural ties to FranceDemographic transitions today follow fairly similar patterns reckon Matthew Delventhal of Claremont McKenna College Jesús Fernández-Villaverde of the University of Pennsylvania and Nezih Guner of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in another new paper The authors gather data on 186 countries and find that all but 11 have experienced the transition to lower more stable death rates that are well below pre-industrial norms A bevy of about 70 countries began their transition towards low fertility rates between 1960 and 1990 Only one countryChadhas yet to begin a fertility transition In 80 countries both mortality and fertility shifts towards modern lows are now completeImportantly the pace at which countries undergo a demographic transition seems to have sped up While Britain transition unfolded in a leisurely fashion between the 1790s and the 1950s Chile occurred more briskly between the 1920s and the 1970s and those begun towards the end of the 20th century have taken only a few decades This acceleration seems at least partly to reflect what the authors call “demographic contagion” or the fact that transitions occur sooner and faster where geographically and culturally proximate places have already undergone a fertility shift This proximity effect may also mean transitions now start at lower income levels Whereas fertility transitions over the past two centuries tended to begin at GDP per person of about $2700 on a purchasing-power-parity basis and in 2011 prices those begun since 1990 occurred at an income level of around $1500The upshot of this rush into the demographic transition is a steady drop in global fertility and population growth The world fertility rate which stood at 35 births per woman in the mid-1980s fell to just 24 in 2019 Indeed it is possible given observed declines in rich-world births during the pandemic that covid-19 may have pushed the world as a whole within sight of a replacement-level fertility rate if only temporarily The world population will continue to grow even after that level is attained because of the large number of people either at or approaching child-rearing age India population for example is still expected to rise to about 16bn by mid-century But that is a lower peak by about 100m people reached sooner by about a decade than previously expected Similarly the rapid decline in global fertility may mean that projections by the UN which show the global population rising towards 11bn by 2100 will ultimately have to be revised downwardsOld moneyThe global completion of the demographic transition will not be without its headaches It may complicate long-run macroeconomic problems for example or so suggests recent work by Adrien Auclert and Frédéric Martenet of Stanford University Hannes Malmberg of the University of Minnesota and Matthew Rognlie of Northwestern University They note that increased saving by ageing populations depresses inflation and interest rates As the share of world population over 50 rises from 25% today to 40% in 2100 low interest rates may become more entrenched returns on assets could drop and global imbalances widenYet demographic transitions could also bring a range of economic benefits Slower population growth could make the challenge of cutting carbon emissions less daunting And the potential of the fewer workers around might be better realised through better education and more women participating in the labour force The arrival of immigrants once viewed as a threat could even become as momentous an occasion as a birth in the family For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 11th 2021,The economics of a new China-Laos train line,IN THE LATE 1860s French sailors who had set off from Saigon to find the source of the Mekong river encountered the precipitous Khone Falls between Laos and Cambodia and realised that the waters would be impassable for larger trading vessels Their dreams of reaching the riches of southern China by river were dashed Quixotic plans for rail networks followed first from British and French imperialists and then from the Association of South-East Asian Nations ASEAN which in 1995 outlined its ambition to connect Singapore with Kunming in China Yunnan provinceListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn December 3rd at long last a portion of those aspirations was realised A high-speed rail line connecting Kunming to Vientiane the capital of Laos was opened after five years of construction The route is part of China Belt and Road Initiative and the completed section comes with a hefty price tag of $59bnequivalent to nearly a third of Laos annual GDP before the pandemicFor China the rationale for closer links with South-East Asia is clear Rising factory wages at home make the case for moving low-complexity manufacturing to cheaper nearby locations In 2019 Vietnam was China fourth-largest trading partner for intermediate goods between America and India and up from 15th place a decade ago China intermediate-goods trade with Cambodia and Laos has risen nine- and 11-fold respectively in the same timeThe strategy has historical precedent Until the 1970s Japanese firms’ main interest in South-East Asia was buying raw materials Then they began moving production to the region The shift took off after the Plaza Accord of 1985 at which Japan agreed to let the yen appreciate which widened the gap between domestic wages and those in low-cost countries Firms were able to preserve their competitive advantage by moving while also fostering technological expertise elsewhereWhat does the new train line mean for Laos? The landlocked country suffers most from South-East Asia limited connectivity The World Bank has been cautiously optimistic about the new route: Vientiane it reckons could become a logistical hub into China from Thai ports but only if the Lao customs system were made more efficient and connecting roads improved Although Laos has a land border with Yunnan and no coastline as recently as 2016 almost two-thirds of its exports to China were transported via maritime routesOther assessments however are less optimistic A paper published by the Asian Development Bank Institute last year suggested that the investment was unlikely to be profitable given its expense Opinions of the Belt and Road Initiative have soured since 2016 and fears have risen that the infrastructure acts as a debt trap which gives China influence over borrowers Laos has assumed 30% of the liability for the project most of the funding for which was borrowed from the Export-Import Bank of China Nor will the line bring in Chinese tourists for the foreseeable future given China zero-covid policyA wider network across the region would yield greater economic benefits for everyone but that is outside any one country control Thailand approved the first step of a Chinese-built high-speed line in March; it is intended to reach the Lao border at a later stage Even the first half is not expected to be completed for five years however and such schemes often miss their deadline if they materialise at all The Malaysian government is studying a high-speed link to Bangkok but serious discussion has barely begun Until those longer-term benefits arrive Laos may mainly be stuck with the bill For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The Bank of England is soon due to stop making new bond purchases; Jerome Powell the head of the Fed has said that he will start to taper purchases more quickly But in the euro area the answer is muddy precisely because the inflation picture is different Some on the ECB council including Isabel Schnabel point out that the unwanted side effects of asset purchases are rising and the gains are diminishing The ECB will therefore be better off providing guidance on its interest rates to steer markets One undesirable consequence of QE could be that central banks are now big players in government-bond markets: the ECB holds more than 40% of outstanding German and Dutch sovereign bonds according to estimates by Danske BankThe expiry in March of one of the ECB bond-buying schemes which was intended to counter the financial-market effects of the pandemic could provide an opportunity for the ECB to stop expanding its footprint in bond markets But not everyone agrees on the need to scale back asset purchases Many economists expect the ECB instead to top up another existing asset-purchase programme in the coming months so as to ensure that bond-buying does not tail off too rapidly Mr Panetta has worried that too sharp a reduction in asset purchases could lead to a “premature increase in long-term interest rates” In other words if the ECB ultimate problem is that inflation is too low rather than too high then it may not have the luxury of doing away with QE For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 11th 2021,In word and deed China is easing economic policy,BEN BERNANKE the former chairman of America Federal Reserve entitled his memoir “The Courage To Act” But a lot of what central bankers do these days is talk They talk about what they are doing will do and might do In central banking words can speak louder than actionsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina is no different Its macroeconomic policymaking is a combination of acts and signals execution and exegesis On December 6th for example the People Bank of China announced that it was cutting the reserve requirement ratio the amount of money banks are required to hold in reserve as a share of deposits by half a percentage point from a weighted average of 89% to 84% That it said would “unleash” about 12trn yuan $190bn of fundingThe cut was you might think a straightforward act of easingan understandable response to a slowing economy a mutating virus and the financial risks posed by property developers two of which Evergrande and Kaisa defaulted on their offshore bonds according to Fitch a rating agency shortly after the cutBut the decision was accompanied by some cautionary talk “The stance of sound monetary policy remains unchanged” the central bank said It also pointed out that banks will need part of the additional funds about 80% of them to repay medium-term loans from the central bank that are due to mature on December 15th Much of the extra money would in other words soon return to the institution that had unleashed it The impact of the cut “is likely to be neutral” said one analyst quoted by Economics Daily an official newspaper An editorial in the same paper cautioned against the “relatively simplistic” view that a cut in reserve requirements amounted to “loose” macroeconomic policySo are China policymakers easing or not? The short answer is yes they are indeed easing But not without qualms and qualifications They want to stabilise growth But they do not want to revive speculation especially in property Their expansionary actions are therefore accompanied by a lot of clarificatory and cautionary chitter-chatterPerhaps the clearest evidence of easing lies not in the deeds of the central bank but in the words of the Politburo the 25-member body that oversees the Communist Party After a meeting on December 6th to set the macroeconomic tone for 2022 it emphasised expanding domestic demand and preserving the “six stabilities” in employment finance trade foreign and domestic investment and expectations The Politburo also had some words of comfort for the beleaguered property market It said the sector should be supported to better serve homebuyers’ “reasonable” demand “Reasonable” was not defined But it is safe to say it does not include buying a property and keeping it vacant in the expectation of selling it for a higher priceThe debate now is not whether China policymakers are easing but by how much Because stimulus can take many forms especially in China measuring its overall scale is not easy One attempt to do so by Goldman Sachs a bank combines indicators of monetary policy the benchmark lending rate and market rates credit policy including reserve requirements fiscal policy and housing policy into a single index In the face of the global financial crisis this index swung by almost 29 points on its scale see chart It swung by a little over two in response to China 2015 slowdown and by a little less than two after the pandemic beganThe easing in the first ten months of this year was modest by comparison The latest reserve requirement cut will add to it but not by much in itself Policymakers therefore have plenty of scope to loosen before they can be accused of replicating the “flood” of stimulus in 2008-09 which has acquired a reputation for profligacy despite its brute effectiveness in returning China to its pre-crisis economic trajectoryIf China policymakers had an equivalent index of their own their cautionary talk could be more precisely calibrated “We may ease by one point but not two” they might say In the absence of such a measure China-watchers have the harder task of inferring macroeconomic intentions from vague party slogans How many cuts in reserve requirement ratios one wonders will be necessary to preserve the six stabilities?

 Dec 10th 2021,Why high inflation will persist in America well into the new year,ANOTHER MONTH another multi-decade high in American inflation The consumer-price index increased by 68% in November compared with a year earlier according to figures released on December 10ththe fastest pace since 1982 If these headlines about inflation highs seem like clockwork in America that is because to a significant extent they now are Such are the basic mathematics of year-on-year price trends The surge in inflation since the start of 2021 means that it is guaranteed to remain elevated in annual terms for a while to come A relatively optimistic forecast would have inflation returning to its pre-pandemic norm only at the very end of 2022To understand why consider the underlying numbers In 2019 the year before covid-19 emerged the average month-on-month increase in consumer prices in America was 02% That was marginally lower over the course of 2020 when activity briefly shuddered to a halt and then roared back to life But in 2021 as the recovery gained altitude prices shot up by an average of 06% month-on-month That surge is now making its impact felt on annual price comparisons Imagine for instance that the consumer-price index in November remained at the exact same level as in October or put differently that there had been zero month-on-month inflation Even then the year-on-year increase in November would have reached 63% the fastest pace since 1990 In fact the additional month-on-month gain of 05% before seasonal adjustment propelled it higher stillWhat does the future hold? The chart presents two alternative paths In the first case inflation momentum immediately falls back to its pre-pandemic trajectory with prices rising by 02% each month That would be a very benign outcome for America Nevertheless in December the year-on-year figure would still climb to yet another four-decade high In the first half of the new year inflation would average a lofty 54% Only in December of 2022 would it recede to a level consistent with the Fed inflation target which is 2% albeit based on a different measure of pricesIn the second case inflationary momentum is unchanged staying at the same month-on-month clip registered over the past year This would make for many a sleepless night for American officials Inflation would soar to nearly 8% in February before receding a little Were monthly price trends to remain at 06% inflation would eventually settle at a year-on-year plateau of 74%Both of the scenarios are likely to be a little extremethe first overly optimistic the second too pessimisticbut are useful thought experiments about the outer boundaries of price trends in America Of course one could posit even more extreme scenarios with inflationary expectations becoming unmoored and prices spiralling ever higher or at the opposite end supply chains suddenly working without a hitch and causing deflation Those however are low on the probability scale The details of the November figures suggest that the more pessimistic scenario will be closer to the mark at the start of 2022 Prices for vehicles an outsized contributor to inflation over the past year are rising again Supply-chain backlogs have improved ever so slightly but are still weighing on industry Energy prices are still high And rising rents have started to feed into broader price pressuresThe challenge for President Joe Biden and above all the Fed is to bend the price curve towards the more benign outcome In this regard there is some cause for optimism even if it will take a while to see results First the giant fiscal stimulus that helped stoke demand in America is running its course Second the Fed is moving towards tighter monetary policy On December 15th the central bank is expected to accelerate the pace at which it “tapers” its monthly purchases of assets mostly government bonds That would open the door for it to raise interest rates as early as March which should mark a decisive turning point in the battle against price pressures In the meantime brace for a few more months of multi-decade highs in inflation It is in the stars and most crucially in the sumsFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Dec 6th 2021,Evidence for the “great resignation” is thin on the ground,AS THE EFFECTS of the Spanish flu waned in 1919 Seattle workers agitated Many were fed up with long hours and poor pay especially at a time of high inflation Shipyard workers went on strike leading others to down their tools in solidarity Newspapers were filled with stories of machinists firefighters and painters quitting their jobs Events in Seattle sparked labour unrest across the rest of America and even much of the rich world Bosses worried that the lower classes had become work-shy anti-capitalistsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSeattle once again seems like ground zero for a big shift in labour relations In October the local carpenters’ union finished a weeks-long strike over pay and conditions Hotels and shops remain understaffed Local tech firms worried about losing staff have raised average salaries by nearly 5% since 2020 Microsoft one of them claimed earlier this year that 46% of the global workforce was planning to make “a major pivot or career transition”Seattle seems like an example of what Anthony Klotz of Texas A&M University has called the “great resignation” That memorable term has quickly become a corporate buzzword spouted on companies’ earnings calls and at cocktail receptions It has also made waves online An “anti-work” message board on Reddit a social-media site is filled with screeds against the demands of greedy bosses The forum now generates more user comments a day than the “WallStreetBets” subreddit which moved stockmarkets earlier this yearThe term is elastic but in essence it makes the proposition that the pandemic has provoked a cultural shift in which workers reassess their priorities People in low-status jobs will no longer put up with bad pay or poor conditions while white-collar types scoff at the idea of working long hours Some people have become lazier or feel more entitled; others want to try something new or desire money less because they have come to appreciate the joys of a simpler life This is supposedly leading to a tsunami of resignations and dropouts There is just one catch: the theory has little hard evidence to support itThe great-resignation thesis seems strongest in America and Britain In October 42m Americans quit their jobs equivalent to nearly 3% of total employment close to the record see chart 1 In the third quarter of the year nearly 400000 Britons moved from one job to another after handing in their notice the highest-ever level Employers may be responding to the threat of further departures too A tracker compiled by Goldman Sachs a bank suggests that wage growth in both countries is unusually strong see chart 2 A weak jobs report for America released on December 3rd seemed to confirm how hard it has become to hire staff even as vacancies remain sky-high The world largest economy added just 210000 jobs in November below economists’ expectations of 550000In other parts of the rich world however a great resignation is harder to spot It is certainly true that millions have dropped out of work Our best guess is that the labour force in the rich world is 3% smaller than it would have been without covid-19 a deficit of 20m people Yet outside America and Britain there is little sign that this reflects more people quittingIn November 107000 Canadians who had left their jobs within the past year did so because they were “dissatisfied” down from 132000 on the eve of the pandemic In Japan the number of unemployed people who had quit their previous job is near an all-time low There are hints of a small rise in resignations in Italy but across the EU as a whole the flow of people from work into leisure is lower than before the pandemic Data from New Zealand on labour-market flows look entirely unremarkable And in many places there is little sign that workers are getting antsy which you might think could presage a rise in resignations The number of industrial disputes in Australia continues to trend downwards Collective disputes are “facing extinction” according to a recent issue of Japan Labour Issues a journal If the pandemic has changed workers’ outlook on the world they are hiding it pretty wellOther factors then probably help explain the decline in the labour force Many people still say they are fearful of catching covid-19 and may therefore be avoiding public spaces for instance Immigrants have returned to their home countriesEven if a wave of resignations is largely an Anglo-American phenomenon is there any evidence that the people who are quitting are doing so because they have become work-shy? Reddit posts aside this does not seem to be the case In Britain a tenth of workers say they would like a job with fewer hours and less paybut that is in line with the long-run average A recent study by Gallup in America suggests that “employee engagement” a rough proxy for job satisfaction is near its all-time high: hard to square with the notion that lots more people are desperate for a way outThat suggests two more prosaic explanations for soaring quit rates One relates to vacancies When there are lots of open positions people feel more confident about handing in their notice even if they rather like their job They may also be poached Vacancies are high right now partly because the pandemic has led to surging demand in new sectors say warehouses for online retail Analysis of America by Jason Furman of Harvard University and of Britain by Pawel Adrjan of Indeed a job-search site suggests that job quits are at the level you would expect them to be given the number of vacanciesMessrs Furman and Adrjan analysis may nonetheless underestimate how unremarkable the surge in quits truly is In both countries resignations sank during the worst of the pandemic in mid-2020 Many people who would like to have left a position last year may only now have plucked up the courage to do so Account for these “pent-up” resignations and the recent pickup looks even less unusualCould a truly “great resignation” ever emerge? It would probably require more radical cultural changes Households would need to decide en masse that their future consumption needs and the income needed to fulfil them were substantially lower That would mean no more foreign holidays less dining out and fewer household appliances It would also mean fewer Christmas presents Anyone who visited a Black Friday sale this year in Seattle or elsewhere would be quickly disabused of the notion that such a dramatic shift was on the cards For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterDig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe
 Dec 4th 2021,Managing the world biggest sovereign-wealth fund is about to get complicated,NICOLAI TANGEN brings an unusual set of skills to the task of leading the world largest sovereign-wealth fund In addition to a career in finance the head of Norges Bank Investment Management NBIM which oversees Norway oil fund of $14trn holds degrees in art history economics and social psychology Mr Tangen public profile and his musings on leadership decision-making and cross-disciplinary learning have been admired by many Norwegians in his first year on the job But the task of running Norway gargantuan piggy-bank is likely to become only more difficult in coming yearsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA fraught appointment process first thrust Mr Tangen into the limelight The controversy centred on his potential conflicts of interest with AKO Capital the $20bn hedge fund he founded After months of heated public debate he transferred his stake in the firm to charity before taking the helm at NBIMHaving paid a hefty price for his job Mr Tangen is determined to make his mark on the fund Early in his tenure he announced three priorities: communication talent development and returns Mr Tangen communicates far more often with the public and the media than his predecessors in an effort to make the workings of the fund more transparent In January NBIM began publishing how it would vote at annual shareholder meetings five days ahead of the proceedings Meanwhile the publicity generated by his appointment has resulted in a surge in job applications to the fund says Mr Tangen He has also hired a sports psychologist in order to bolster his employees’ emotional resilience to the ups and downs of marketsIt is the performance of the fund however that matters most NBIM is given an investment mandate and an equities-bonds split by the ministry of finance Over time the allocation towards stocks has risen to around 70% today see chart In return income streams from the oil fund finance about a quarter of Norway annual budget Performance has held up so far: the fund posted an annual return of 94% in the first half of this year though in the third quarter it gained only 01% compared with the previous three months Since it was established in 1996 the investment pot has delivered on average 025% of excess returns a year over a benchmark index of global equities and bondsMr Tangen has wriggle room within the confines of his mandate The sheer size of the fund means that even small tweaks can make a big difference to returns in cash terms For a long time the investment pot was run much like an index fund owning on average 14% of every listed company in the world But in April Mr Tangen announced a greater emphasis on a more active strategy called “negative selection” which involves selling stakes in companies that look especially risky He wants to strengthen the fund forensic-accounting team to root out fraud Even before Mr Tangen took over the fund had cannily reduced its exposure to Wirecard a German payments firm that imploded after a hole in its finances was exposedMr Tangen who says he plans his life in discrete chunks like a Communist apparatchik expects to stay in his job for five years The rest of his tenure is likely to hold several challenges The biggest worry by far is inflation which could hit the value of both the fixed-income and the equities portions of the fund portfolio A period of low real returns looms especially as politicians have little appetite for the fund to invest in opaque private assets which may fare better in inflationary timesLower returns as well as a more active approach could complicate the communications challenge Espen Henriksen of the Norwegian Business School in Oslo worries that frequent hobnobbing with the public distracts Mr Tangen from “deep principled thinking about asset management” NBIM was such a political and financial success Mr Henriksen reckons because it oversaw a de facto index fund for so long A more active strategy could leave the sovereign-wealth fund more open to criticismAnother concern is political interference says Karin Thorburn of the Norwegian School of Economics Politicians have previously been content to leave the fund to get on with making money But Norway centre-left government which came to power in September seems to take a different view In his first interview since the election Jonas Gahr Store the prime minister said that the fund was “political” as it belonged to the Norwegian people and its mandate was set by parliamentThe ruling party has made clear its intention to encourage NBIM to do more to reduce its portfolio companies’ greenhouse-gas emissions This happily dovetails with Mr Tangen desire to be a responsible investor and he says need not jeopardise the fund returns The danger however is that political influence does not stop there and that it begins to hurt performance Those lessons in psychological resilience could well prove handy

if many holders want to withdraw their money at the same time and the issuer holds risky assets then the digital coins could be in danger of collapsing On November 30th Janet Yellen America treasury secretary said that the tokens presented “significant risks” and pressed for more regulationBefore America instituted a national currency in 1863 banks issued their own banknotes backed by assets and redeemable for gold or silver Critics of stablecoins often point to this period of free banking and the example of unstable “wildcat” banks in particular as a cautionary tale Gary Gensler the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission America main markets watchdog and Elizabeth Warren a Democratic senator have both compared stablecoins to wildcats as has a recent paper by Gary Gorton of Yale University and Jeffery Zhang of the Federal Reserve The comparison is not so clear-cut howeverThe lack of a national currency before 1863 created obvious economic inefficiencies Dollars issued by unfamiliar banks a long way from home traded at a discount due to the lack of information about the financial health of their issuers For the issuing bank having notes circulate far away was an advantage since the holders were very unlikely to turn up to redeem them This arrangement led to the appearance of scam artists like Andrew Dexter who bought up banks across north-eastern America and issued huge volumes of fraudulent notes One bank was found to have issued around $580000around $13m in today moneywhile holding all of $8648 in precious-metal specie In another case in 1838 state officials in Michigan found that the boxes which should have contained the coins for which depositors could redeem their notes were bulked up with lead and broken glassCritics argue that the comparisons with stablecoins are clear Tether the largest single stablecoin issuer with $74bn in tokens in circulation was fined $41m by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in October for misrepresenting itself as fully backed by assets between 2016 and 2019 Tether responded with a statement saying that “There is no finding that Tether tokens were not fully backed at all timessimply that the reserves were not all in cash and all in a bank account titled in Tether name at all times” and that it had never failed to satisfy redemption requestsYet there are also differences between stablecoins and the private money of antebellum America Back then anyone who needed banking services or currency had to place their financial fate in the hands of opaque and risky institutions By contrast no one in the rich world is obliged to hold stablecoins; safer alternatives such as insured bank deposits and cash are readily availableNor is it clear that wildcat banks are the summation of all historical experience of privately issued money George Selgin of the Cato Institute a libertarian think-tank has likened the use of wildcat banking by critics of private-money issuance to the use of Germany interwar hyperinflation by critics of central-bank money issuance: both are extreme and negative examples rather than representative Scotland free-banking system between 1716 and 1844 for instance is often cited as a period of stability Three large banks and several smaller lenders all issued currency and redeemed each other notes at their full valueFurthermore at least some of the problems with American free banking may have reflected poor regulation rather than a total absence of it Banks were often not allowed to have networks of branches and interstate banking was near-impossible which limited the expansion of successful and trusted institutions Many were also made to hold volatile state bonds as collateral Slumps in the value of these couldand didspark local banking crisesPolicing the frontierHistory alone littered as it is with both scam artists from 19th-century America and upstanding financiers from Georgian-era Scotland cannot settle the question of how dangerous stablecoins are But perhaps one less-appreciated lesson from American free banking is that if innovation is not to be smothered the quality of regulation matters A report published by America President Working Group on Financial Markets last month recommended treating stablecoin issuers like deposit-taking institutions Providers say that this degree of supervision is stifling Such regulation would offer them a prize however: accounts at the Federal Reserve which would allow them to settle payments directly rather than piggybacking on commercial banksOne idea detailed by Messrs Gorton and Zhang and supported by Mr Selgin and Dan Awrey of Cornell University would be to make reserve accounts easily available to any stablecoin provider on the condition that they hold all their assets in such an account That would mean that the coin is fully backed with the safest possible asset: central-bank reserves that carry no risks in terms of liquidity maturity or credit Scholars may be divided over whether too much or too little regulation led to the wildcats’ demise But stablecoins could still avoid their fate Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Measuring the universe most important sector Nov 27th 2021Janos Kornai understood capitalism by studying its opposite Nov 20th 2021A whodunnit on Zillow Nov 13th 2021For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 4th 2021,How piecemeal carbon pricing affects cross-border lending,IN JUNE THE IMF made the latest of many calls from economists for a market-oriented policy to tackle climate change “Carbon pricingis the least-cost option to deliver deep emission cuts” it argued in a paper written ahead of a meeting of the leaders of the G20 group of large economies Carbon taxes as this newspaper has long argued can be a powerful way to force polluters to pay for the harm they do to the environment by burning fossil fuelsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWith the political will for a global tax lacking many places are going it alone The World Bank reckons that 45 countries and 34 subnational jurisdictions have adopted some form of carbon pricing ranging from taxes to emissions-trading systems But these schemes cover only about a fifth of global greenhouse-gas emissions New research shows that such piecemeal progress can have unintended consequencesA recent paper by Luc Laeven and Alexander Popov of the European Central Bank published by the Centre for Economic Policy Research CEPR analyses data on more than 2m loan tranches involving banks doing cross-border lending between 1988 and 2021 during which time many countries imposed carbon pricing The authors find that carbon taxes at home led banks to reduce lending to coal oil and gas companies domestically but also had the perverse consequence of causing them to increase such lending abroad The effect they write is “immediate” and “economically meaningful” The shift was most pronounced for banks with big fossil-fuel-lending portfolios and loans were most likely to be directed towards countries lacking a carbon taxThis conclusion comes on the heels of a related CEPR paper which found that banks increase cross-border lending in response to stricter climate policies at home with the effect more evident for banks with previous experience of international lending Steven Ongena of the University of Zurich one of its authors argues that banks “use cross-border lending as a regulatory-arbitrage tool” by shifting dirty loans to countries with laxer climate policiesThe findings suggest that cracking down on carbon is a bit like squeezing a balloon Press too hard all at once and it may pop but squeeze only in one corner and the air will simply flow to where there is less pressure Such effects also mirror concerns about leakages in industrial markets The EU carbon-pricing scheme used to grant exemptions to heavy emitters for fear that they would otherwise move production abroad Now as the EU looks to close those loopholes it is considering a carbon border-adjustment mechanism to level the playing-fieldYet domestic carbon pricing is still a policy worth pursuing says Tara Laan of the International Institute for Sustainable Development a think-tank Messrs Laeven and Popov conclude that even after accounting for their efforts to shift dirty lending overseas carbon taxes do somewhat reduce net fossil-fuel lending by the banks studied because they lower domestic lending by more Uday Varadarajan of RMI another think-tank agrees but points out that supplementing domestic carbon-pricing policies with measures to discourage leakage say by urging greater transparency could boost the impact of carbon-pricing schemesThe best solution of course would be worldwide adoption The IMF suggests that high-emitting countries start by embracing a modest carbon “floor” in order to provide a stepping stone to a global price As the evidence of perverse consequences arising from localised pricing schemes mounts the main task for policymakers is to orchestrate a global squeeze For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Dec 4th 2021,India inches towards inclusion in big bond indices,A WAVE OF passive capital flows is the handsome prize for countries that secure a place in major bond indices That prospect seems to be on the horizon for India Many analysts expect part of its government-bond market to enter indices compiled by Bloomberg a data provider and JPMorgan Chase a bank as early as next year or perhaps 2023 The government has been keen on inclusion even as it has been ambivalent about other types of capital flows Its cautious approach is increasingly in line with economists’ shifting attitudesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe flows that inclusion in major bond indices tend to generate are one of the least objectionable forms of international investment They tend to come from massive slow-moving fundsthe opposite of the flighty hot-money flows that emerging-market policymakers fear That might be why index inclusion has been a priority for India finance ministry Until last year a cap of 6% on the foreign ownership of government bonds had been the main factor preventing India inclusion in the big bond indices Then officials introduced a “fully accessible route” for overseas investors which lifts the foreign-ownership limit on some bondsAnalysis by big investment banks suggests that re-weighting by global investors would prompt flows of $30bn-40bn into India bond market That would exceed the current stock of foreign investors’ holdings which amounts to a mere 2% of the more than $1trn in outstanding Indian government securities Reliable and regular inflows of foreign capital could help suppress public-borrowing costs Corporate borrowers could also benefit from lower benchmark rates And the rupee would be bolstered according to analysts at Morgan Stanley a bankThe hope for India and many other emerging-market governments would be to mimic China experience Foreign ownership of its central-government bonds has more than doubled from 45% to 106% in the past four years without any noticeable hiccups and without jeopardising China broader capital controls But other countries’ experiences show just how unusually benign that isIndia own recent relationship with portfolio-investment flows explains the government hesitation in opening up fully ownership caps will remain on other bonds and assets Sizeable outflows from foreign-bond investors occurred in 2013 2016 and 2018 all driven by expectations of tighter policy from the Federal Reserve The 2013 sell-off in particular was combined with a sharp drop in the rupee Foreign bondholders likewise rushed for the door at the onset of the pandemic last yearEven the IMF once a stalwart opponent of capital controls is more equivocal these days Last year the fund Independent Evaluation Office noted that the views of India authorities and the IMF on capital controls had become more aligned although the fund is still happier with allowing large exchange-rate movements in response to external shocks than is the typical Indian policymakerNor is the capital that comes with index inclusion entirely stable Although inflows triggered by inclusion are far less sensitive to the domestic economic environment they are between three and five times more sensitive to global financial conditions suggests IMF research published last year Investors often trim their allocations to riskier emerging markets and retreat to safer assets like cash and American Treasuries during times of market stress The fact that Indonesia was part of indices constructed by Bloomberg and JPMorgan for instance did not stop foreigners selling off its government bonds in the panic of spring 2020 Foreign ownership of the country bonds had declined to 21% in October this year from 39% in December 2019 Research by the Asian Development Bank also finds that foreign ownership of local-currency bonds can increase the volatility of capital flows particularly in the least developed marketsStill international institutions are hardly advocating stopping inflows altogether In a report earlier this year the Bank for International Settlements a club of central bankers argued that deep and liquid financial markets prudent monetary and fiscal policy and strong company balance-sheets could act as buffers against the sometimes volatile ebb and flow of capital If India is to realise the full benefits of inclusion it will have to heed that counsel For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 1st 2021,China economy looks especially vulnerable to the spread of Omicron,JACK MA THE founder of China giant e-commerce platform Alibaba started his first web company after a visit to America in 1995 Cao Dewang the boss of Fuyao Glass a Chinese company made famous by the documentary “American Factory” ventured into manufacturing after a trip to the Ford Motor Museum in Michigan The museum

AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTravel is vital to innovation Unfortunately what is true of business is also true of viruses At some point on its journey around the globe the covid-19 virus re invented itself The new Omicron variant will further entrench China tight restrictions on business travel Indeed it may cause more disruption to China economy than to other GDP heavyweights That is not because the virus will spread more widely in China On the contrary It is because the government will try so hard to stop it from doing soSince the end of May China has recorded 7728 covid-19 infections America has recorded 152m And yet China curbs on movement and gathering have been tighter especially near outbreaks see chart 1 Its policy of “zero tolerance” towards covid-19 also entails limited tolerance for international travel It requires visitors to endure a quarantine of at least 14 days in an assigned hotel The number of mainlanders crossing the border has dropped by 99% according to Wind a data providerThese restrictions have stopped previous variants from spreading But periodic local lockdowns have also depressed consumption especially of services like catering And the restrictions on cross-border travel will inflict unseen damage on innovation Cutting business-travel spending in half is as bad for a country productivity as cutting R&D spending by a quarter according to one study by Mariacristina Piva of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan and her co-authorsIf the Omicron variant is more infectious than other strains it will increase the likelihood of covid-19 outbreaks in China leading to more frequent lockdowns If the restrictions were as severe as those China briefly imposed in mid-August when it was fighting an outbreak that began in the city of Nanjing the toll on growth could be considerable If imposed for an entire quarter the curbs could subtract almost $130bn from China GDP according to our calculations based on a model of lockdowns by Goldman Sachs a bankequivalent to around 3% of quarterly outputOmicron is not the only threat to China economy Even before its emergence most forecasters thought that China growth would slow to 45-55% next year as a crackdown on private business and a property slowdown biteWorse scenarios are imaginable If China suffers a property slump as bad as the one it endured in 2014-15 GDP growth could fall to 3% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with a year earlier according to Oxford Economics a consultancy That would drag growth for the whole year down to 38% If housing investment instead crashed as badly as it did in America or Spain in the second half of the 2000s growth in China could fall to 1% in the final quarter of 2022 see chart 2 That would take growth for the year down to 21% Losses would leave “numerous” smaller banks with less capital than the regulatory minimum of 105% the firm saysNeither of these scenarios is inevitable Oxford Economics rates the probability of a repeat of 2014-15 as “medium” not high China inventory of unsold properties it points out is lower now than it was seven years ago It thinks the chances of a repeat of an American or a Spanish-style disaster are low Both the scenarios assume that China policymakers would respond only by easing monetary policy But a more forceful reaction seems likely Although the authorities’ “pain threshold” has increased meaning they do not intervene as quickly to shore up growth they still have their limits “I don’t think the Chinese government is dogmatic It is quite pragmatic” says Tao Wang of UBS a bankThus far the property sector pain has been masked by the strength of other parts of the economy Exports have contributed about 40% of China growth so far this year points out Ting Lu of Nomura another bank as China provided the stay-at-home goods the world craved If the new variant sends people back into their bunkers China exporters may enjoy a second wind More likely export growth will slow perhaps sharply Mr Lu thinks exports will be flat in price-adjusted terms next year contributing nothing to China growth The economy will therefore need other sources of helpThe most attractive stimulus options bypass the bloated property sector which already commands too big a share of China GDP The government could for example cut taxes on households improve the social safety-net and even hand out consumption vouchers The problem is that consumers may be slow to respond especially if their homes are losing value Not even China government can force households to spendA more reliable option is public investment in decarbonisation and so-called “new” infrastructure such as charging stations for electric vehicles and 5 G networks The difficulty however is that these sectors are too small to offset a serious downturn in the property market as Goldman Sachs points outThe government will thus try to stop the property downturn becoming too serious Analysts at Citigroup another bank expect that China policymakers will prevent the level of property investment from falling in 2022 That will allow GDP to expand by 47% To accomplish this the analysts reckon China central bank will have to cut banks’ reserve requirements by half a percentage point and interest rates by a quarter-point early next year The central government will need to ease its fiscal stance and allow local governments to issue more “special” bonds which are repaid through project revenuesIt will also require more direct efforts to “stabilise” if not “stimulate” the property market The government will need to make it easier for homebuyers to obtain mortgages and ease limits on the share of property loans permitted in banks’ loan books Citi economists think the authorities may even show some “temporary forbearance” in enforcing their formidable “three red lines” the most prominent set of limits on borrowing by property developers which cap developers’ liabilities relative to their equity assets and cashThe one set of curbs China seems quite unwilling to ease are the covid-19 restrictions on international travel They will probably remain in place until after the Winter Olympics in February and the Communist Party national congress later next year They may remain until China population is vaccinated with a more effective jab perhaps one of the country own invention The authorities have been unconscionably slow in approving the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer The government may also want to build more hospitals to cope with severe cases Before covid-19 the country had only 36 critical-care beds per 100000 people Singapore has three times as manyBusinesspeople in Shanghai have started talking about travel restrictions persisting until 2024 The virus is highly mutable China policy towards it however is strikingly invariant For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Dec 1st 2021,Three threats to growth in emerging markets,THE NEWS as the second anniversary of the pandemic nears could be better The emergence of a covid-19 variant labelled Omicron has sparked a wave of selling on financial markets seemingly on concern that a new highly transmissible strain of the virus could set back economic recoveries worldwide With luck Omicron may prove manageable But continued disruptions from various variants of covid-19 represent just one of three formidable forces that will squeeze emerging markets in 2022 alongside tighter American monetary policy and slower growth in ChinaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKStart with American policy Markets knocked for a loop by Omicron sagged further on November 30th after Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve suggested that the central bank might accelerate its plan to taper its asset purchases Thanks to the critical role of the dollar and Treasury bonds in the global financial system a more hawkish Fed is often associated with declining global risk appetite Capital flows towards emerging markets tend to ebb; the dollar strengthens which because of the greenback role in invoicing reduces trade flowsIn order to assess which places face the biggest squeeze from a tightening Fed The Economist has gathered data on a few key macroeconomic variables for 40 large emerging economies see chart 1 Large current-account deficits high levels of debt and of that owed to foreigners especially rampant inflation and insufficient foreign-exchange reserves are all indicators that can spell trouble for countries facing fickle capital flows as American monetary policy tightensCombining countries’ performance on these measures yields a “vulnerability index” on which higher scores translate into greater fragility Some places are already in serious trouble Argentina which tops the list faces an inflation rate above 50% and a deepening economic crisis Turkey fundamentals look a little better but its woes are compounded by the government stubborn desire to lower interest rates in the face of soaring prices The lira has been hammered losing 45% against the dollar in 2021 diminishing the purchasing power of Turks’ wages and pensionsThe second element of danger comes from China slowing economy When China falters exporters around the world feel the pain It is by a large margin the world biggest consumer of aluminium coal cotton and soyabeans among other commodities and a major importer of goods ranging from capital equipment to wineRanking the same 40 economies by their exports to China as a share of their own GDP yields an index of vulnerability to the country Many of the biggest exporters to China like Vietnam are critical links in manufacturing supply chains which should be untroubled as China domestic economy slows as long as Americans keep shopping and Sino-American trade relations stay stable At greater risk are the poorer commodities exporters that have helped feed China population and provide for its building boomThis gauge of exposure to China can then be compared with our measure of vulnerability to American monetary-policy tightening see chart 2 Some countries’ fates are more linked to one of the giants than the other An unlucky bunch such as Brazil and Chile appear most likely to suffer from a double whammy Despite high levels of debt and soaring inflation high commodity prices have enabled Brazil to just about maintain investors’ confidence A softening Chinese economy could deprive Brazil of that benefit leading to a tumbling currency even higher inflation and the possibility of economic crisisThe world has faced the combined pressure of hawkish American policy and a stumbling China before In the mid-2010s fragile emerging markets were squeezed by a rising dollar as the Fed withdrew the monetary support provided during the global financial crisis while a badly managed round of financial-market liberalisation and credit tightening triggered a slump in China Growth across emerging markets excluding China sagged from 53% in 2011 to just 32% in 2015The squeeze this time is almost certain to be worse That is in part because the Fed is expected to tighten policy more quickly than it did in the 2010s when a weak recovery and stubbornly low inflation forced it to go slow Then more than two-and-a-half years elapsed between the Fed announcement of its intention to reduce its asset purchases and the first rise in its policy rate This time by contrast the 12 months following the Fed announcement of its plan to begin tapering in November are likely to involve a complete halt to bond-buying and according to market pricing at least two interest-rate risesChina for its part also seems at greater risk of a hard landing today than it was a half-decade ago Most economists thought growth would slow to 45-55% even before the emergence of Omicron That would with the exception of 2020 be the lowest growth rate since 1990Another reason for the pain this time around is the addition of a third hazard to emerging markets: the spread of Omicron and the risk of future variants Little is yet known about the danger posed by Omicron But the emerging world remains particularly vulnerable to nasty outbreaks of the virus With a few exceptions vaccination rates in poorer countries lag behind those in rich ones Just a tenth of Africa population has received even one jab less than the share of Americans that has received a third shot Of our group of 40 countries vaccination rates are particularly low in Egypt and Pakistan two countries that are also especially vulnerable to American monetary tighteningThe spread of a new variant against which existing vaccines may be less effective could prove back-breaking to tourism-dependent economies And public purses in the emerging world more broadly are in no fit state to extend or reintroduce pandemic relief measuresWorking out how the three threats might interact with each other is tricky But it is possible that their coincidence could lead to still more economic pain for poorer countries Unforgiving capital markets as the Fed tightens could leave emerging-market governments fiscally hamstrung in the face of new outbreaks Omicron-induced local lockdowns in China could deal emerging-market exporters another blow The tourist-dependent countries of South-East Asia once popular destinations for Chinese visitors are likely to remain deserted for a while longerThe pandemic third year was already destined to be a rocky one for emerging markets stuck as they are between the two poles of a tightening America and a slowing China New variants could make the journey still more perilous To keep up with our latest coverage on the spread of the Omicron variant go to economistcom/omicronFor

Aaron Ramsdale got a hand to the ball and kept it out “Best save I’ve seen for years” said Peter Schmeichel a former goalie Others noted a crucial detail Before the ball was struck Mr Ramsdale was on his toes his weight distributed evenly ready to jump in either direction By keeping perfectly balanced he made a wonder-save possibleListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBalance or the lack of it matters in financial markets just as in football A market in which bets are slanted in one direction is vulnerable to a big swing in prices the opposite way Where positions are lopsided traders can be wrong-footed by even a tiny change in sentiment or in the news Some of the recent volatility in global bond markets can be put down to skewed positioning When liquidity is patchy as in today Treasury market the results can be some surprisingly large shifts in bond yieldsTo understand all this imagine you are pondering a trade You notice that covid-19 infections are rising in Europe and that governments are imposing partial lockdowns Meanwhile there are signs that America economy is picking up steam You conclude that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates sooner than people expect and a lot sooner than the European Central Bank A way to profit from this analysis might be to sell the euro against the dollarBefore you go ahead you would be wise to check how other traders are positioned America Commodity Futures Trading Commission publishes regular reports on the positions of traders in currency futures and options If say there were already a lot of euro shorts you should feel less gung-ho After all if many traders have already sold the euro there are fewer potential sellers to drive it down in the future And there are perils when a lot of investors are betting one way In the event of unexpected news that is positive for the euro the speculators who are short the currency would be nursing losses Some would be forced to buy back the euros they had sold As more traders scrambled to cover their short positions the euro would appreciate sharply This is a classic “short squeeze” or “position washout”That brings us to bond-market volatility Inferring traders’ positions from bond futures is tricky says Kit Juckes of Société Générale a bank The nature of finance is to borrow short and lend long This “natural positioning” will tend to obscure other speculative bets says Mr Juckes Perhaps this is why a lot of the recent discussion of volatility has been focused on liquidityhow easy it is to get in or out of a position quickly A report this month by a working group drawn from America Treasury the Federal Reserve and other regulatory bodies provides an example It blames evanescent liquidity for the dramatic jumps in bond yields in for instance March 2020 and in February this year It puts this down to a change in market structure New regulations in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-09 made it costlier for banks to hold large inventories of bonds to facilitate client trading A small group of electronic high-frequency traders has since supplanted the banks These firms keep the market super-liquid most of the time But they are thinly capitalised and cannot hold a lot of bonds for long In volatile markets they are forced to take less risk So when liquidity is most needed it tends to vanishThese and other changes in market structure have tended to make positions more extreme Bond-buyers are less heterogeneous says George Papamarkakis of North Asset Management Funds are bigger Information flows more quickly And momentum trading the buying of recent winners and selling of recent losers is a more prevalent feature of bond markets In the halcyon days before the financial crisis there were marketmakers who were willing and able to lean against momentum to take a view based on fundamentals and to hold bonds for more than a day or a few seconds But not anymore So positions become crowded When a piece of news goes against a popular trade the washout can be quite dramaticA market that leans too far one way is eventually forced to reverse In this regard the bond market is like a goalkeeper who gambles on where a free kick is going He shifts his weight to one side of the goal in anticipation But he is often left flapping in despair as the ball heads for the other cornerRead more from Buttonwood our columnist on financial markets:Baillie

 Nov 27th 2021,What Jerome Powell must do next as Fed chairman,OF ALL AMERICA’S many job openings this was the most important On November 22nd President Joe Biden announced that he would renominate Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his current term expires in February After a drawn-out selection process it was reassuring that Mr Biden at last made the obvious choice opting for a steady pair of hands at a time of economic dangerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Powell must confront two broad challenges The first and by far the most pressing is how to tame inflation now running at its highest rate in more than three decades see next story Mr Powell was rightly commended for presiding over a strong response to last year pandemic-induced slowdown Unwinding stimulus will be more treacherousBefore raising interest rates Mr Powell has all but pledged to halt the Fed monthly purchases of bonds that helped reinvigorate the economy over the past 20 months The Fed has started to reduce or taper its purchases this month but it is only on track to stop them altogether by June 2022 This means that a first rate increase is at least half a year into the futureThe immediate question for Mr Powell then is whether to taper more quickly As it stands even if the Fed is reducing its purchases it is still pumping cash into the financial system when the stockmarket is near record highs Moreover an earlier completion of the taper would give the Fed more options It need not commit itself to raising rates early next year but it would be wise to have that on the menuYet it would take courage for Mr Powell to do this “If suddenly you have a new taper schedule and critically it has clear implications for rates you are rolling the dice as to the market reaction” says Krishna Guha of Evercore ISI an advisory firm But sticking to gradual tightening as inflation gallops higher is just as big a gambleThe other big challenge for Mr Powell is how to define the central bank role amid ever-increasing demands on it The alternative candidate to lead the Fed was Lael Brainard a governor on the Fed board who was favoured by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party Mr Biden has nominated her to be vice-chairwoman giving her more influence She and Mr Powell have differing views on three questions that are now coming to the foreFirst under Mr Powell the Fed has chipped away at the most onerous rules erected around the banking system after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 This deregulation earned Mr Powell the enmity of left-wing Democratic politicians and Ms Brainard regularly voted against it Now that she is second only to Mr Powell the signal is that regulation may tightenOn climate Mr Powell has said that global warming poses economic risks but is not a big factor in the central bank own decisions That is defensible: the Fed should leave the environment in the main to other parts of the government But Ms Brainard wants the climate to figure more prominently in the Fed calculus Mr Powell must accommodate that demandSimilarly Ms Brainard has called for the Fed to launch a “central bank digital currency” to ensure that the dollar remains the dominant global currency Mr Powell position is that he wants the Fed to study the matter further saying that it is better to be right than to be first At least he need not worry about being first: China is already well ahead of America in the digital raceMr Powell will in short have a crowded agenda over his second term At the top of it is quelling inflation without crashing the economy Time to get to work 
 Nov 26th 2021,Measuring the universe most important sector,TEN YEARS ago Chinese property was described as “the most important sector in the universe” by Jonathan Anderson now of Emerging Advisors Group a consultancy Property was a big source of China growth household spending and appetite for commodities like iron ore Today the sector has become a source of universal concern as housing sales have dropped developers have defaulted and the price of iron ore has tumbled China-watchers are eager for a rigorous measure of the sector importance to the country economy And in recent months the world press has converged on a number: 29% of GDPListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat estimate which has been cited in this newspaper the Financial Times the Wall Street Journal Bloomberg and elsewhere comes from a paper by Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard and Yuanchen Yang of the IMF Both economists have impeccable credentials But their number 287% to be precise does not count what most people think it counts The most prominent measure of the most important sector in the universe is widely misunderstood So how should it be interpreted? To grasp it properly requires a gentle walk through the ins and outs of inputs and outputsImagine an economy that makes a house and nothing else The house is the output of the construction industry But to make it builders require inputs They need steel which is the output of the metals industry And the steel requires iron ore the output of the mining industry Assume these are all that is required The house sells for $1m the steel for $600000 and the iron ore for $500000 Now ask yourself how important is the construction industry?One narrow answer is 40% of GDP In making the house builders add $400000 to the value of the steel they buy They therefore account for two-fifths of the home $1m value Since the house represents the entirety of the economy GDP a narrow measure of the construction industry importance is 40% of GDPA broader answer is 100% of GDP The house is the economy only “final” product Everything else the economy makes is just an ingredient in that cake The only reason to make ore is to make steel And the only reason to make steel is to make houses These “upstream” industries are therefore intimately linked to construction If housing demand wavers so will demand for steel and ore So 100% of the demand for final products in this economy is demand for the things the construction industry makesHow would Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang measure the importance of property? Those who have not read their paper might assume their figure is similar in spirit to the first narrow answer They may think it refers to the value added by the property sector which in their paper includes services like estate agents as well as developers People who have glanced at the paper may assume their approach instead conforms to the broad answer The property sector has tight links with upstream industries Therefore its importance includes not just the value it adds but also the value added by its upstream suppliers of steel and other inputs and their suppliers of ore and other materialsIn fact Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang do not exactly follow either approach Applied to our simple economy their method would yield an answer of $11m or 110% of GDP It would count the iron ore $500000 It would also count the full value $600000 of the steel even though that includes the value of the ore an input to the input But it would not count the $1m value of the house or even the $400000 of value added by the construction industryWhy not? Their approach is an unusual attempt to correct for double-counting If you were to add construction output the $1m home steel output $600000 and mining output $500000 you could be accused of double- or even triple-counting You would have counted the steel twice and the ore three times once on its own a second time when it is embedded in the steel and a third time when the steel is embedded in the homeThe typical intuitive way to avoid this problem is to count only the value that is added at each stage of production $500000 plus $100000 plus $400000 in our simple example That method yields the “broad” answer of 100% of GDP in the one-house economy The method employed by Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang includes some things not counted in this measure and excludes others that are In the one-house economy their approach would count the steel once the ore twice and the construction not at all In the case of China economy they argue these inclusions and exclusions cancel out in practice “The direct construction value added we did not include and the inputs of input we did includeare very similar in scale and offset” writes Ms Yang “The alternative perhaps more intuitive approach does not change our message”Steel yourselfIn a forthcoming comment on Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang paper a team of economists at the Asian Development Bank ADB including Mahinthan Mariasingham and John Arvin Bernabe has taken the more intuitive approach totting up the value added by construction and property services as well as the value added by other industries in supplying them and by the suppliers of their suppliers Using the same numbers as Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang for real-estate investment and services albeit for 2017 not 2016 they reckon that China property sector accounted for 154% of GDP in 2017 Excluding imports the number fell to 138%There is another wrinkle however The investment numbers used by Mr Rogoff and Ms Yang and the ADB may miss some buildings constructed by enterprises that are not officially classified as property developers Including them while using the more intuitive approach increases the property sector importance to a little over 23% of GDP in 2018 according to Andrew Tilton and his team at Goldman Sachs The sector remains of cosmic significance But anyone alarmed by the 29% figure can rest about six percentage points easier Read more from Free Exchange our column on economics:Janos Kornai understood capitalism by studying its opposite Nov 20th 2021A whodunnit on Zillow Nov 13th 2021Do “greedy jobs” cause the gender pay gap?

 Nov 25th 2021,American inflation: global phenomenon or homegrown headache?,Editor note: On November 22nd after this article was published the White House said it would nominate Jerome Powell to a second term at the Federal ReserveTHE FRISSON of relief among some of America most outspoken left-leaning economists is unmistakable Whenever other countries report high inflation figures they seize on it as evidence that America own bout of price rises is part of a global trend “I hate to ruin the victory lap of all the people boasting that Biden Recovery Act would be inflationary but the UK also had a big jump in inflation with no big stimulus” tweeted Dean Baker of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research a think-tank on November 17th A few days earlier Paul Krugman a Nobel-prizewinning economist made a similar comparison between Europe and America “What happening in the United States isn’t mainly about policy” he concludedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat argument if correct matters a great deal The implication would be that inflation is largely out of the hands of American officials Like their counterparts elsewhere they are hostage to the pandemic-blighted global economy Central bankers in this view should be cautious about increasing interest rates because that would do nothing to boost production the nub of today problemsAre these economists right? Is America inflation now running at its fastest in three decades global or homegrown? The case for the former is straightforward Most rich countries from Britain to Australia face similar price pressures One common denominator is snarled supply chains which have made everything from cars to furniture scarcer and dearer Another commonality is the pandemic lingering impact on the labour market On November 19th Christine Lagarde the head of the European Central Bank said that higher services prices reflect job vacancies in contact-intensive workplaces such as restaurants The diagnosis applies just as well to America Simply put life is not yet back to normal and inflation is a symptomThis global perspective is unquestionably important Yet it is insufficient: inflation is now higher in America than in any other advanced economy by some distance The clearest comparison is to look at prices today and those 24 months ago to iron out data distortions from the pandemic On this basis consumer prices are up by about 8% in America twice as fast as in the euro areaThe case that this is at least partly homemade points to America unusually forceful pro-growth policies throughout the pandemic Over the course of 2020 and 2021 America fiscal deficit is on track to average about 14% of GDP according to the Congressional Budget Office That is higher than in any other G7 countryThe Federal Reserve has also stood out for its ultra-loose policies such as its bond-buying The assets on the Fed balance-sheet have doubled over the past two years as a share of GDP This month the Fed started to pare back bond purchases but financial conditions remain loose with real interest rates in negative territoryThe remarkable degree of stimulus helps explain the boom in American retail sales There is no doubt that the pandemic has shifted consumption from services towards goods Yet even allowing for this distortion the American data are jaw-dropping In the second quarter of 2021 spending on durable goods was roughly a third higher than in the final quarter of 2019 far outpacing the increases in other big economies see chart 2Indeed buoyant American demand may well have exacerbated global shortages and spilled over into higher inflation elsewhere Consider maritime shipments Port throughput in America was 14% higher in the second quarter of 2021 than in 2019 Other parts of the world have been more subdued: throughput in Europe was 1% lower But shipping rates everywhere have soared as capacity has been diverted to transpacific tradeRecognising that inflation in America stems in part from its stimulus does not mean that those policies were bad They catalysed its vigorous economic rebound and its rapid drop in unemployment Yet as time goes on the inflationary dangers have become apparentIf ultra-loose policies helped cause inflation tighter policies ought to figure in the solution The Fed is gradually moving in that direction On November 19th two of its governors Richard Clarida and Christopher Waller speaking at separate events said that the central bank next meeting in December may include a discussion on whether to scale back its monthly asset purchases more swiftly That in turn could clear the path for interest-rate increases in the first half of 2022President Joe Biden for his part has adjusted his tone on inflation As recently as July he described the jump in prices as temporary a by-product of the pandemic In recent weeks he has instead been forthright in saying how much inflation hurts Americans and declaring that “reversing this trend is a top priority”What can the president do to lower prices? Some of his actions have been more performative than substantive On November 23rd Mr Biden announced that America would release 50m barrels of oil from a national strategic stockpile in a bid to lower prices at the pump But that is not enough to truly move the needle On November 9th the White House announced an “action plan” to expand port capacity but that could take years to bear fruit Mr Biden could remove tariffs on Chinese products to help lower import prices Yet that could be construed as a win for China politically untenable in America these daysIn one respect however Mr Biden has done the right thing if only by default As his pandemic stimulus expires fiscal policy is naturally getting stingier The Hutchins Centre a think-tank calculates that this tightening could lop about two percentage points off America growth rate next year Critics have argued that an ambitious social-spending and climate packagethe cornerstone of Mr Biden agenda currently wending its way through Congresswould add to inflationary pressures But its investments will be spread out over a decade adding up to less than 1% of GDP each year That will deliver only a modest upfront kick to growth and have a negligible impact on prices “My landmark legislation is relatively insignificant in the near term” would not make for a great political slogan But after 18 months of big government spending it is just what the American economy needs Clarification: Since this article was first published chart 1 has been amended to include more countries and to show covid-related fiscal measures instead of the fiscal deficitFor more coverage of Joe Biden presidency visit our dedicated hub and follow along as we track shifts in his approval rating For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Nov 25th 2021,The bright new age of venture capital,YOUNG COMPANIES everywhere were preparing for doomsday in March 2020 Sequoia Capital a large venture-capital VC firm warned of Armageddon; others predicted a “Great Unwinding” Airbnb and other startups trimmed their workforces in expectation of an economic bloodbath Yet within months the gloom had lifted and a historic boom had begun America unleashed huge stimulus; the dominance of tech firms increased as locked-down consumers spent even more of their time online Many companies including Airbnb took advantage of the bullish mood by listing on the stockmarket The market capitalisation of American VC-backed firms that went public last year amounted to a record $200bn; it is on course to reach $500bn in 2021Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWith their pockets full investors are looking to bet on a new generation of firms Global venture investmentwhich ranges from early “seed” funding for firms that are only just getting going to funding for more mature startupsis on track to hit an all-time high of $580bn this year according to PitchBook a data provider That is nearly 50% more than was invested in 2020 and about 20 times that in 2002The type of investor piling into venture activity has changed just as dramatically It was once the preserve of niche venture-capital firms run in Silicon Valley These raised funds from and invested on behalf of pension funds and other end-investors often relying on their vast networks of connections with company founders Now however only three of the ten biggest venture investors by assets under management are traditional VC firmsInstead deals led or solely struck by private-equity shops hedge funds and others that used to conduct little venture activity are on track to nearly double from $144bn in 2020 to $260bn this year see chart 1 That accounts for a staggering 44% of global VC activity up from 20% in 2002 “Crossover” funds like Tiger Global Management which straddle public and private markets are deploying capital at a breakneck pace Behemoth pension funds are increasingly directly investing in startupsThe flood of money from deep-pocketed investors has helped swell valuations But it is also flowing to once-neglected corners and new opportunities Venture activity now extends well beyond Silicon Valley and America more broadly and is financing enterprises working on everything from blockchains to biotechThe wave of capital is also transforming how VC works VC firms are adopting new strategies as they seek to differentiate themselves in some respects and to mimic their Wall Street competitors in others That comes with both benefits and drawbacks for the business of innovationThe modern venture-capital industry sprouted from a laboratory at Fairchild Semiconductor a Silicon Valley chipmaker in the 1960s Arthur Rock a banker for Fairchild who became a VC raised $5m in his first fund and returned $100m over seven years Two of Fairchild's founders Eugene Kleiner and Don Valentine soon followed setting up Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia respectively Both are still large VC firms todayThe approach was to back risky startups in the hope that the big successes like Google would carry an entire portfolio Seed investments were often made before a startup earned any revenue Then came an alphabet soup of successive funding rounds typically ranging from series A to C as a company matured The VCs’ funds were closed-ended meaning they distributed returns to investors usually pension funds endowments and other long-term-oriented investors within seven to ten years after taking a cut of their ownVeni vidi vcThe venture capitalists did not just provide finance They also played consiglieri often taking a seat on a company board They offered a wealth of experience and access to a network of contacts introducing startups to professional chief executives for instance Entrepreneurs flocked to Sand Hill Road the home of many Silicon Valley VC firms in the hope of being funded The industry reliance on personal connections made it rather like an old boys’ clubThe model proved astoundingly successful Although VC-backed companies represent less than 05% of American companies created every year they make up nearly 76% of the total public-market capitalisation of companies started since 1995 Over time VCs increasingly bet on slightly older “late-stage” startups which for their part delayed going public Some VC firms opened offices abroad Andreessen Horowitz also based on Sand Hill Road was founded in 2009 and rose towards the topWhy then is the model being disrupted? The frenzy is a result of both the entrance of new competitors and greater interest from end-investors That in turn reflects the fall in interest rates across the rich world which has pushed investors into riskier but higher-return markets It has no doubt helped that VC was the highest-performing asset class globally over the past three years and has performed on a par with bull runs in private equity and public stocks over the past decadeEnd-investors who previously avoided VC are now getting involved In addition to alluring returns picking out the star funds may be easier for VC than for other types of investment: good performance tends to be more persistent according to research in the Journal of Financial Economics published last year The success of big tech much of which was backed by VC dollars may have been another attraction Investors may have previously underestimated the earning potential of the tech industry says Fred Giuffrida of Horsley Bridge a fund that invests in VC funds They may now be correcting for thisThe rush of capital has pushed up prices Venture activity for seed-stage startups today are close to those of series A deal sizes for older companies that may already be generating revenue a decade ago The average amount of funding raised in a seed round for an American startup in 2021 is $33m more than five times what it was in 2010 see chart 2But funding is also reaching new terrain In 2002 84% of venture activity in terms of value took place in America That share is now about 49% China share grew from below 5% in the 2000s to 37% in 2018 before its tech crackdown brought it down to nearer 20% Capital has instead sought greener pastures in Europe see Business section Keith Rabois of Founders Fund a vc firm argues that if done right investing in less heated sectors can help produce attractive venture returnsSoftware startups continue to be popular with venture capitalists But “you’re seeing a broadening of who gets funded” says Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School Riskier biotechnology crypto and space ideas are being backed Moderna a pharmaceutical company that produces covid-19 vaccines was spun out of Flagship Pioneering a VC firm Green tech which saw a boom and bust in the 2000s is resurgent PwC a consultancy estimates that between 2013 and 2019 climate-tech venture deals grew at five times the rate of overall startup fundingFor many old-school venture capitalists this new competitive world is unsettling “We need to react” acknowledges Roelof Botha of Sequoia Though rising valuations bolster returns on current portfolios they dry up future returns Crossover funds are less price-sensitive than traditional VCs And for later-stage startups investors’ money is more fungible says Mr Giuffrida It matters less who is investing than how much they are willing to pay Furthermore the market for orthodox VC firms is becoming tougher Despite the venture boom fundraising by new niche VCs in America has fallen from a peak of $14bn in 2018 to an expected $55bn in 2021One part of the traditional firms’ response is differentiation Many crossover investors tend to take a data-driven approach building portfolios of startups that resemble an index of top performers in each sector They eschew playing large roles in their portfolio companies To contrast with this some VCs are emphasising their personal touch Crossover funds “are transactional capital We are relationship capital” says one early-stage investorOne fund in Austin Texas 8VC is expanding its startup “incubator” which currently nurtures and spins out five or so companies a year Slow Ventures another VC firm is even investing directly in the career paths of individuals such as online-content creators who may not yet run a proper business Without a compelling offering says Ben Horowitz co-founder of Andreessen VCs either need to be willing to overpay or close up shop altogetherAnother response is to scale up Some angel investors who invest their own money without a team or firm are spreading their wings and evolving into solo venture capitalists who invest external funds They can move fastthere are no other partners to convince before doing a deal Elad Gil a prominent solo VC made around 20 investments in the first half of 2021 and is raising a $620m fund an astonishing sum for an individual investorThe biggest and best-known VC firms are also expanding Andreessen has grown its investment team from about 25 to 70 in the past four years It offers companies support on everything from diversity and inclusion policy to a vast network of potential hires and customersThe line between VC and other investors is also blurring further and not just because Wall Street is encroaching onto Sand Hill Road Big VC firms are becoming more like other asset managers too Sequoia is expanding its presence in public markets In October it said that its American and European venture funds will sit within a larger timeless fund When portfolio firms go public their shares will flow to the superfund instead of to end-investors This allows Sequoia to capture returns even after an IPO Crossover funds like Tiger already seamlessly transfer holdings from their private to public funds Other large VC firms may follow suitSequoia superfund mirrors Wall Street fascination with permanent capital “Many of the dynamics in private-equity markets are now spilling over into venture markets” says Mr Lerner VCs and private-equity funds used to raise money from investors every few years which can be costly and prevent them holding on to investments Leading buy-out firms like Blackstone and KKR found ways around this Nearly a third of KKR assets under management are now permanentSequoia is also becoming a registered investment adviser joining Andreessen and other large funds like SoftBank That allows it to hold more “secondary” sharesstakes that are not bought directly from the issuing company VCs’ secondary holdings are usually capped at 20% of their portfolios Andreessen status as an adviser allowed it to launch a $22bn crypto fund in June that mainly invests in digital tokens rather than startupsThe biggest funds are best placed to benefit from the new world Funding from a top VC firm sends a signal of a startup quality argues Mike Volpi of Index Ventures And because non-traditional investors often rely on such signals to guide their dollars their value has only risen The result is that the industry has become more unequal: although the average American VC assets under management rose from $220m in 2007 to $280m in 2020 that is skewed by a few big hitters The median which is less influenced by such outliers fell from $70m to $48m But this is not to say that the industry has become dominated by a few star funds Market shares are still small Tiger Global for instance led or co-led investments worldwide worth $5bn in 2020 just 13% of total venture funding Startups have diverse enough needs so there is plenty of scope for a variety of VC firms to exist reckons Mr VolpiCompany founders for their part have gained bargaining power as investors compete “There never been a better time to be an entrepreneur” says Ali Partovi of Neo a VC firm based in San Francisco Ten years ago most new founders had not heard of a term-sheet a document describing the terms and conditions of an investment says one venture capitalist Now many startups work with “accelerators” like Y Combinator to learn the basics Cloud computing and other software-as-a-service SaaS tools allow some firms to expand without much capital investmentThe time taken to strike a deal has shrunk from several weeks to days if not hours Zoom has changed the nature of fundraising Biodock a microscopy startup had ten calls with VCs scheduled in a day which gave it more power in negotiations reckons Michael Lee its founder Founders receive “refreshes” top-ups of equity during fundraising rounds To get ahead of the rush some investors are offering companies cash even before they start looking for more fundingThe shift in power away from investors is welcome in some respects The outsized returns of VC firms will be competed down Moreover tech is no longer terrain that only well-connected venture capitalists in Silicon Valley can make sense of The performance of SaaS firms for instance can be assessed using data on users’ behaviour The relationship between founder and venture capitalist might matter less than it used to particularly as the startup growsBut there are costs too Shortened deals can lead to FOMO fear of missing out for investors and sometimes worse investment decisions says Mr Partovi The shift has also weakened governance As the balance of power tilts away from them VCs get fewer board seats and shares are structured so that founders retain voting power Founders who make poor chief executivessuch as Travis Kalanick the former boss of Uber a ride-hailing firmcan hang on for longer than they should The relationship between VC firms and a founder lasts about ten years longer than many marriages notes Mr Partovi You wouldn’t choose your spouse in a hurryAnother risk is that the market is too frothy Some investors point to bumper profits for tech companies and the financial health of even the youngest startups as reasons for being optimistic about valuations But “companies are being priced on the assumption that everyone will win Statistically that won’t happen” says Mr Giuffrida of Horsley BridgeStellar returns for investors then are not assured But the broader question is whether the innovation that is taking place is worth the risk “If too much stuff gets funded that generally good It much better than nobody funding Moderna” says Mr Horowitz And capital can drive new ideas not just the other way around Investors have typically been willing to bet on riskier but more innovative startups during past venture booms finds a study by Ramana Nanda of Imperial College London and Matthew Rhodes-Kropf of MIT Sloan School of Management Resilience a capital-intensive drugmaker founded last year has raised $800m and already bought several factories This would not have been possible even two years ago says Drew Oetting of 8VC Venture activity in the space sector grew by 70% globally to $77bn in 2020 “There are more moonshots” reckons Mr Lerner of HarvardIn tech the result could be more vibrant competition The big-tech firms used to gobble up challengers: acquisitions by Amazon Apple Facebook Google and Microsoft rose after 2000 and hit a peak of 74 in 2014 But they have fallen since to around 60 a year in 2019 and 2020 perhaps owing to a fear of antitrust enforcement see United States section More startups are making it to public markets Listings rather than acquisitions or sales now account for about 20% of “exits” by a startup compared with about 5% five years agoWherever valuations go it looks like the changes to the structure of VC will last Outsized returns in early-stage investing were bound to be bid down eventually As VC firms themselves are forced to innovate a broader range of ideas is being backed in a wider variety of

 Nov 20th 2021,Frequent-flyer schemes provide airlines with a lifeline,WHEN EXECUTIVES at American Airlines unveiled the world first frequent-flyer programme 40 years ago they probably didn’t imagine it would one day be worth more than the airline itself Last year analysts valued the scheme at around $18bn-30bn eclipsing the company current market capitalisation of $129bn Such programmes have proved a boon to American carriers in the pandemic Firms including American Airlines have raised $30bn in debt backed by the schemesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAirlines once hoped simply to foster loyalty by offering customers freebies Passengers collected miles as they travelled and were awarded a free flight once they racked up enough of them But schemes today are far more sophisticated Airlines profit by selling miles to credit-card firms at a price that exceeds the cost of providing reward flights and dishing out other perks such as hotel stays They also gain when miles expire unused or are cashed in for something of poor value According to McKinsey a consultancy 15-30% of miles expired unused before the pandemicCredit-card issuers in turn use miles to lure customers with bonuses Airline-affiliated cards tend to rake in much more in transactions a year than other cards Many miles are therefore earned not in the air but through card spending on the groundThat explains why customers earned $68bn-worth of miles across big loyalty schemes in 2020 even as many kept to their homes If they were to rush to convert those miles into free flights as travel takes off again the profitability of such schemes would be jeopardised But airlines have another way to ensure that their programmes stay profitable: they can deflate the value of their miles In the early 2010s American airlines began to calculate the value of a mile based on a complex formula of fares and routes In 2015 Delta Air Lines stopped disclosing how the value of its miles was calculated and embarked on a series of devaluations prompting competitors to follow In the past year or so Delta Southwest and United have devalued miles on major routes by 6-20%Airlines have tapped loyalty schemes for cash before by selling miles to credit-card firms at discounted rates United traded its miles with JPMorgan Chase a bank for $600m in the financial crisis But the pandemic saw the first use of loyalty programmes as collateral in America says Benjamin Metzger of Barclays another bank United was the first to do so with a secured loan in June 2020 Delta followed with a bond offering soon afterThe deals have attracted more investors than bonds secured by old aircraft which unlike loyalty schemes depreciate Scheme-backed debt tends to boast a better credit rating than the airline issuing it And investors are comforted by the structure of the deals which use the schemes’ cash flows to repay debt and limit risk if an airline goes bust Affinity Capital Exchange a fintech firm is working with JPMorgan to securitise air miles so that they can be more easily tradedThe trick for airlines in all this is to balance the costs and benefits of perks so that customers stay engaged while carriers’ margins are preserved Endless devaluations could rattle that equilibrium and upset securitisation arrangements Sky-high valuations are not assured For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Nov 20th 2021,The case of Japan curiously quiescent inflation rate,INFLATION IS SURGING around the world with price rises now exceeding central banks’ targets But Japan is a notable holdout Although policymakers there have long sought to generate inflation consumer prices still refuse to budge In September they rose by just 02% year-on-year and inflation excluding fresh food and energy prices actually fell by 05% in the same period Analysts at Goldman Sachs a bank expect that measure to fall to -08% in the latest data which was due to be published after this was written By comparison a “core” measure rose by 46% in America in October 34% in Britain and 29% in Germany see chartListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhat going on? Japan is not insulated from global trends In October producer prices rose by 79% year-on-year the largest single increase since 1980 The pickup was overwhelmingly led by higher import costs which rose by 38% in yen terms The prices of petroleum products and lumber rose by 45% and 57% respectively compared with the same month last yearThese increases may in small part have been offset by an idiosyncratic factor Tumbling mobile-phone fees driven by a government campaign against carriers are pulling down the consumer-price index as a whole The communications segment of the basket is down by 28% year-on-year Yet even if fees were flat inflation would still be below target That suggests broader economic factors are an important part of the storyEntrenched expectations built up through decades of little to no inflation play a big role in explaining why rising producer costs have not fed through to consumer prices Domestic companies are notoriously unwilling to pass on increases in the prices of imports to consumers At a press conference in October Kuroda Haruhiko the governor of the Bank of Japan attributed this reluctance to habits picked up during the country periodic bouts of deflation Companies have a good reason to resist increases Last week Kikkoman a producer of soy sauce announced a 4-10% increase in its prices from February Such an event might barely be noticed in America But in Japan it made the national newsAnother crucial factor is the weakness of Japan consumer recovery Private spending fell in the third quarter of the year and is now 35% below where it was at the end of 2019 Spending on durable goods the source of much American inflation has been practically flat for the past eight years in JapanThe Bank of Japan was an early adopter of zero-interest-rate policies and bond-buying programmes tools that have since been used elsewhere in the rich world as interest rates hit rock-bottom after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 The absence in Japan of the same inflationary pressures apparent across other advanced economies once again makes the country a laboratory for economistsDespite the Bank of Japan activism inflation has persistently failed to reach its 2% target Its assets ran to 103% of Japanese nominal GDP even before the pandemic and bond and stock purchases since have pushed that share up to 134% In the same period the Federal Reserve purchases have risen from 19% to 36% of American GDP The Bank of Japan policy to keep ten-year government-bond yields at around 0% is still firmly in place even as a similar effort at yield-curve control by the Reserve Bank of Australia was abandoned after it came under market pressure in OctoberThis suggests that whatever is raising prices elsewhere in the worldwhether supply-side constraints associated with the pandemic demand-side stimulus or some combination of the twomonetary easing alone is struggling to move the needle when confronted with decades of low inflation expectations Kishida Fumio Japan new prime minister has vowed to deploy a fiscal-stimulus package that includes cash for poor families and the under-18s Analysts at Barclays another bank expect new spending worth 37% of GDPThese handouts may well nudge up inflation if the money is actually spent by consumers rather than saved But for now Japan seems to be the place that inflation forgot yet again For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Nov 20th 2021,Janos Kornai understood capitalism by studying its opposite,IN HIS CABIN aboard the SS Bashan a luxury river boat sailing to Wuhan Janos Kornai was sleepless with excitement The Hungarian economist who died last month was one of seven foreign experts invited in 1985 to share their views on China economic reforms As Julian Gewirtz recounts in his book “Unlikely Partners” Mr Kornai stole the show On a week-long cruise with an audience of Chinese technocrats he dissected socialism familiar “cares and woes” featherbedded firms rushed growth and consumer shortages And he offered a hopeful vision of a restrained guided capitalism His book “Economics of Shortage” soon became a bestseller in China although he never saw any royaltiesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKForty years earlier Mr Kornai lay on the roof of a Jesuit monastery in Budapest hiding from a fascist raid down below even as Soviet forces dropped bombs from above The skyline had a “hellish beauty” he wrote As a Jewish Hungarian who had lost his father and a brother to the Holocaust he welcomed the Soviets as liberators He did not even mind when they stole his watch His gratitude was one reason why he became an enthusiastic communist so devoted to his work on a party newspaper that he missed the birth of his first child His communism in turn explains why he became an economist He pored over Karl Marx “Das Kapital” Enlightenment radiated from it “like sunshine” he later wrote “I had no more doubts about what profession to choose”The spell of Marxism broke when he met a victim of the torture it entailed He also came to hate the improvised haste of journalism He turned instead to research at Hungary Institute of Economics But his reporter habits served him well in his dissertation By interviewing managers grumbling with them about bureaucratic idiocy wastage and “disregard for customer needs” he crafted a rare systematic account of how a planned economy actually worked as opposed to how it was supposed to work The book also served as an index of shifting political winds It was celebrated in the lead-up to the Hungarian revolution in 1956 denounced after that revolution was crushed by Soviet tanks then approved for translation into English all by the same person the director of the instituteSome socialist reformers thought that widespread state ownership was compatible with market forces and price signals But Mr Kornai recognised that getting prices right even if it were possible would not be enough Under capitalism a firm cannot defy prices for long without going bust Under socialism things were different State-owned firms knew they could always appeal to higher authorities to bail them out In 1979 Mr Kornai called this a “soft budget constraint”: the sharp line drawn by economists on their blackboards was smudged If firms do not fear losses they need not heed prices This lack of financial restraint also allowed firms to indulge their “investment hunger” an excessive appetite for resources which squeezed out consumers and resulted in chronic shortagesThe argument made his name: it was a “congenial” extension of a concept familiar to mainstream economists Mr Kornai had once had larger ambitions hoping to smash the crystal through which most economists viewed the world He had studied neoclassical theorists such as Kenneth Arrow with much the same care he had lavished on Marx But he could not square their ethereal “general equilibrium” theory with his observations of the living breathing economy The mismatch reminded one economist of a line by the poet Edith Sodergran: “You searched for a woman and found a soulyou are disappointed”On the China cruise Mr Kornai convinced his audience of the need to harden the budget constraints of the country firms One of his fellow passengers is now China banking regulator But the imposition of financial discipline remains a work in progress The rise in defaults even of state-owned firms in recent years is evidence of some harder financial lines But it comes only after years of gluttonous investmentChina has not however suffered chronic shortages On the contrary it is a “super-surplus” economy marked by massive excess capacity as Xu Chenggang one of Mr Kornai students has pointed out One reason is that state-owned enterprises do not have the economy to themselves They coexist with fiercely competitive private firms The surpluses may also reflect the dual nature of investment It is both an immediate source of demand and an eventual source of supply In the short run it makes a claim on the economy resources which can crowd out consumers But when the investment bears fruit it adds to the economy ability to supply goods and services resulting in abundance not scarcityTeam transitoryLike the economies he deciphered Mr Kornai inhabited two worlds He was half in the mainstream of economics half out From 1983 he was half in America half out The transitions were not always easy It took him time to perfect his English In his Boston driving test he declared that a “no hitchhiking” sign was a “no hijacking” sign In a lecture he repeatedly mispronounced warehouse as whorehouse On returning home to Hungary each year he had to remember to drop his upbeat stateside persona and complain a bit moreBut although he straddled different worlds he was in no doubt where his allegiances ultimately lay “Despite its detrimental and morally nasty featuresI would sooner live under the capitalist system than in the happiest barrack in the socialist camp” he wrote in his memoir And although he was intellectually opposed to patriotic bombast he felt an instinctive pride in the achievements of his compatriots It was their music and literature that moved him Their unillusioned meliorism that animated him He counted in Hungarian And when he wasn’t sleepless with excitement he dreamt in it too

 Nov 18th 2021,China seeks to extend its clout in commodity markets,FEW CRISES highlight China weight in commodity markets as clearly as the global energy crunch Though analysts attribute the shortages to many different causes all mention China Its post-covid economic recovery coupled with a hot summer produced a surge in demand for power Supplies of its two main sources of electricity coal and hydropower were curbed by environmental crackdowns and droughts respectivelyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt first China tried to supplement power generation with liquefied natural gas LNG Its imports of LNG so far this year are 14% higher than in the same period last year That has caused prices to surge and has had ripple effects around the world As LNG cargoes have been rerouted east for instance Europe has found itself short of gas Rising gas prices have only underscored the importance of coal in China which already consumes 55% of the world supply of the stuff In October China imported nearly twice as much coal as it had in the same month in 2020 causing prices to boom Even oil has risen on expectations that China will burn that too if necessary to keep its electricity plants running As usual in commodity markets other factors are also at play But China still shakes the worldChina heft is partly the result of its size As a huge consumer and in some cases producer of materials it can disrupt global markets even with modest tweaks to policy Its clout is growing on the financial side of commodity trading too thanks to China three big futures exchanges; international traders say that you cannot be successful without dealing on them Now China wants to extend its influence over commodities further still Officials are aiming to turn the proliferation of local contracts for instance into international price standardsThe rule of thumb for commodity traders is that China consumes “half of everything” For some materials such as iron ore even this is an understatement see chart 1 China big appetite alone gives it influence in markets But it also means that the authorities deem many commodities strategically important And they are not shy about interveningTake maize A glut in China in 2010-15 pushed government inventories up to unprecedented levels and led the authorities to reduce financial incentives to corn farmers But the resulting fall in output was too sharp forcing China to look overseas to replenish stocks Corn imports jumped from less than 5m tonnes a year in 2013-18 to almost 30m tonnes in 2020 Partly as a consequence American corn prices doubled over the first half of last yearChina strategies also involve boosting supply to keep prices low In order to keep a lid on infrastructure costs in the 2000s it invested in a huge number of aluminium smelters and encouraged producers to raise output Graeme Train of Trafigura a trading firm estimates that the smelters cost around $70bn But without them the price of aluminium would probably have increased in line with that of copper says Mr Train And that would have raised China infrastructure costs by an extra $1trn or so between 2000 and 2015In some cases China appetite has helped create new financial systems Iron ore the main ingredient of steel is a good example Between 2003 and 2016 China imports of the ore rose tenfold as it built masses of steel-intensive infrastructure Today it is the world biggest consumer of iron ore for which it has also become “the world most sophisticated” market says a manager at a big mining firmBuyers in other countries such as Japan and South Korea tend to prefer long-term contracts In China a dynamic spot market has emerged which gives punters opportunities to resell excess ore and informs the price of long-term contracts Dozens of seaports act as mini iron-ore exchanges They have storage facilities and serve as places where customers can buy and sell ore Analysts look at the portside price to gauge the outlook for the marketChinese trading firms are becoming more sophisticated too The biggest such as PetroChina and Sinopec two state-owned oil companies are getting better at strategically steering the market notes Michal Meidan of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies They mimic tactics used by European traders That includes placing bets to shift the price of the Dubai benchmark which in part helps inform the prices in their long-term contracts Other Chinese traders are scaling up In March COFCO a food giant announced plans to float its trading armChina commodity-futures exchanges are now world-beating The three big ones are in Dalian Shanghai and Zhengzhou The number of contracts traded on these in 2020 was six times higher than on America CME Group exchanges see chart 2 In terms of value they were roughly equivalent From January to June this year the ten most-traded agricultural futures contracts were all Chinese So were eight of the top ten metals contracts and five of the top ten energy contractsChinese exchanges look different from Western ones They are dominated by retail investors who are nicknamed “chives” because when they get cut down they soon grow back Estimates from 2016 suggest that this group holds around 85% of open positions compared with 15% on Western bourses They trade smaller lots too and hold them for less time which adds to liquidity A lack of expertise means retail investors tend to accentuate price swings For the most part they are losing money says Xiao Jin of Orient Futures a brokerFor officials in Beijing the next step in the development of China commodity markets is to turn the country benchmarks into global standards One reason for this is to boost use of the yuan which is used to conduct only 2-3% of cross-border commodity trades compared with the dollar share of 38% Another is that officials are wary of Western benchmarks suspecting that they may have been manipulatedUntil now China way of protecting its manufacturers and consumers from price volatility had been through isolation Only select state firms could trade on foreign commodity-futures exchanges and only a small group of international traders could access Chinese ones Those exchanges have no warehouseswhich are where physical commodities are deliveredoutside the mainland Foreign exchanges are not allowed warehouses inside ChinaBut the new strategy of benchmark nationalism is leading China to slowly loosen the rules for international traders Around 80 commodity-futures contracts are traded on its big exchanges nine of which are available to foreign punters That covers mostly imported commodities such as copper and oil Some of these trade on Shanghai International Energy Exchange a subsidiary of the city Futures Exchange designed to appeal to traders abroad As more investment firms take advantage of arbitrage opportunities the prices of futures contracts on Western and Chinese exchanges are more often moving in tandemMore opening up is in the works In September the State Council China cabinet said it would launch more futures contracts accelerate the participation of overseas traders in Chinese markets and build another yuan-denominated exchange aimed at such puntersTwo big problems stand in the way of these ambitions though One is shifting commodity demand Over the next decade this is likely to become more evenly spread around the world argues Jeffrey Currie of Goldman Sachs a bank Climate-friendly policies require vast amounts of metals to build wind turbines and power grids Meanwhile China economy will slowly become more services-oriented reducing the need for commodities Its consumption of some metals such as aluminium is expected to peak in the next few yearsAnother hurdle is trust China commodity exchanges are closely tied to the state Senior managers move between exchanges and government departments Authorities intervene readily in markets Investors point to China intervention in equity markets after a downturn in 2015 Back then it banned short-selling and told investors with big stakes in companies that they could not sell shares All this makes commodity investors worry about the predictability of Chinese marketsIndeed China has dabbled with commodity-market intervention in the past year as prices have gone berserk Authorities worry that rising costs will squeeze the manufacturing sector To offset this in the summer they sold some of their metal reserves and cracked down on speculative hoarding In September they auctioned off oil reserves too In both cases the extra supply was so small that it had no lasting effect on prices But analysts think the goal was not to move the market but to signal to investors that regulators are watching itThe energy transition will probably make commodity prices much more volatile as demand and supply adjust over time and one occasionally overshoots the other Chinese authorities will have to decide whether to interfere or let markets respond The path they choose will determine the

 Nov 16th 2021,Baillie Gifford and the three quandaries of fund management,THE HOME of the Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust SMIT is an office a mile down the road from Edinburgh Castle Aside from that it has little to do with Scotland and nothing at all to do with mortgages This makes it an apt flagship for Baillie Gifford a British investment manager that prides itself on its unconventionality Baillie Gifford 12 trusts and 33 funds together oversee assets worth £346bn $466bn That puts it well below the heavyweight category for global fund managers whose members hold assets in the trillions Yet the firm and its star vehicle hold wider lessons for other fund managersListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAmong the previous jobs of members of Baillie Gifford investment team are ballerina soldier doctor and concert pianist One partner likes to tell potential clients that the firm equity-fund managers aren’t much interested in the stockmarket Another describes her enthusiasm for a founder who is so focused on developing a breakthrough medical technology that he refuses point-blank to discuss what his company could be worth But even those investors who insist on vulgar bean-counting will be impressed by the fact that £1000 invested in the SMIT ten years ago would be worth around £11600 today By contrast the same amount invested in the FTSE All-World index of stocks would be worth around £3800The author of this success is James Anderson who took the helm of the SMIT 21 years ago and will step aside in April The iconoclastic Mr Anderson participates in a long tradition of fund managers pouring scorn on their own industry Conventional asset management he said in his latest annual review of the SMIT is “irretrievably broken” Markets are in thrall to the “near-pornographic allure of news such as earnings announcements and macroeconomic headlines”Mr Anderson has used his tenure to mould the SMIT to his liking When he took over the trust then 91 years old held shares in hundreds of listed firms around half of which were British Today it invests in a few dozen public and private companies based all over the world The meteoric rise in the trust share price was fuelled by backing companies like Alibaba Amazon Tencent and Tesla early and then hanging on to them Along the way the amount of money Baillie Gifford oversaw grew by a factor of tenThe challenges the firm faces as Mr Anderson leaves are emblematic of those that confront the wider industry The first is how to prevent a run of extraordinary performance from reverting to the mean and becoming pedestrian Under Mr Anderson the SMIT broadened its horizons to include new geographies and unlisted companies It also placed bets on firms with unconventional business models and maverick founders that put other investors off That does not mean that the route to future success lies in finding more privately owned companies run by irascible bosses The SMIT outperformance in fact came from its early recognition of trends such as the growing dominance of internet retailers and the increasing importance of electric vehicles There is no set of rules for arriving at such insights and so no guarantee of repeating themThe second challenge is to square the opportunities for returns with investors’ demands for social responsibility The firm “health innovation” strategy attempts to do this by betting on a hoped-for megatrend that will deliver both profits and improved medical care But elsewhere in Baillie Gifford portfolio is BGI Genomics a Shenzhen-based firm It is part of a group that had two subsidiaries placed on an American watch list last year for “conducting genetic analyses used to further the repression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities” in Xinjiang according to the Commerce Department Even the most quixotic aim can end up in a moral quagmireThe final challenge is timeless and universal: succession In announcing Mr Anderson departure Baillie Gifford emphasised continuity His replacement Tom Slater has managed the SMIT jointly with him since 2015 The philosophy and investment process of the trust it insists will not change Yet it is losing the leadership of an uncommonly prescient investor Mr Anderson himself has written of his waning enthusiasm for Amazon as Jeff Bezos its founder and CEO stepped aside and it ceased to feel like “Day One” at the company Having been founded in 1908 Baillie Gifford first era passed a long time ago As another day draws to a close replicating its successes will be a tall orderFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterAn early version of this article was published online on November 16th 2021

 Nov 13th 2021,Belize shows the growing potential of debt-for-nature swaps,IF ECONOMIES WERE measured by their natural capital as well as the physical and human sort Belize would be a richer country than it is What the tiny Caribbean state lacks in cold hard cash it makes up for in warm tropical biodiversity The Belize Barrier Reef the second largest expanse of coral in the world is packed with turtles manatees and other threatened species Holidaymakers flock to its coast to dive snorkel or simply gaze at its waters from the comfort of a hammock Or at least they did before the pandemic Last year tourism dried up growth contracted sharply and public debt jumped from just under 100% of GDP in 2019 to over 125%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat forced Belize not for the first time into a debt restructuringone in which it is seeking to exchange one sort of riches for another As part of the deal concluded on November 5th Belize bought back its only international bond a $553m liability misnamed the “superbond” at 55 cents on the dollar It funded that with $364m of fresh money arranged by The Nature Conservancy TNC an NGO which is insured by the International Development Finance Corp an American agency The transaction is backed by the proceeds of a “blue bond” arranged by Credit Suisse a bank The payback is due over 19 years with a coupon that begins below that of the superbond but rises above it over timeIt is called a blue bond because Belize has pledged to invest a large chunk of the savings into looking after the ocean That includes funding a $23m endowment to support future marine-conservation projects and promising to protect 30% of its waters by 2026It might be argued that Belize should do this anyway to support tourism which accounts for 40% of economic activity But at a time when governments and investors are looking at novel ways of funding environmental clean-ups Belize was able to use its natural patrimony to gain leverage over bondholders Whether it will be enough to stop it defaulting again in the future is another matterDebt-for-nature swaps are nothing new Lenders have been offering highly indebted countries concessions in return for environmental commitments for decades But these transactions have historically involved debt owed to rich countries not commercial bondholders As Lee Buchheit a lawyer who specialises in sovereign-debt restructurings points out they were “negligible in size” In total the value of debt-for-climate and nature-swap agreements between 1985 and 2015 came to just $26bn according to the United Nations Development Programme Of the 39 debtor nations that benefited from the swaps only 12 negotiated debts of over $30m “It was really an exercise in public relations” Mr Buchheit saysA lot has changed since then Governments are now under immense pressure to make ambitious commitments on climate change and biodiversity And investors are eager to show they can make money as well as being committed to environmental social and governance goalsOther poor countries are trying to move in the same direction At the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow Ecuador president Guillermo Lasso proposed enlarging the country Galapagos nature reserve through a debt-for-nature swap And TNC is in talks with other poor countries interested in doing something similar Once a blueprint is in place agreement gets simpler The last restructuring of the same sort that it took part in which involved $216m of debt owed by the Seychelles to the Paris Club of creditors took four years to thrash out Negotiations in Belize lasted a year and a halfYet no amount of creative dealmaking can distract from the grim truth: many emerging markets still suffer from crushing debts The pandemic has pushed half of the world poorest countries into debt distress or heightened the vulnerability to it And debt-for-nature swaps only help at the margin Last week restructuring reduced Belize external debt by $250m or 12% of GDP The success is for coral reefs more than debt relief For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Nov 13th 2021,A whodunnit on Zillow,THE TIMING was apt On November 2nd just two days after Americans celebrated their scariest annual holiday news of a suspicious death shocked the stockmarket Zillow a giant property and technology firm said it would shut down its huge instant-buying or i-buying business which uses big data and algorithms to make offers on homes in dozens of cities in America and then swiftly sells them on The firm expects to lose in excess of $500m in the second half of 2021 after it overpaid for thousands of homes It will lay off a quarter of its 8000 employees It seemed like a business that should be in rude health By and large it has been a fantastic time to buy a home almost anywhere in Americaif you can only snag one: house prices have climbed between 16% and 25% during the past 18 months So why is Zillow i-buying business in the morgue? And whodunnit?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFinding the right suspect matters for reasons bigger than the fate of Zillow itself The i-buying business is one of many examples of firms using a platform to collect big data analyse it using advanced techniques and empower their algorithms to enable a market to work more smoothly This trend has pushed down transaction costs in many asset markets from stocks and bonds to camera equipment and clothing The fate of Zillow i-buying business might indicate that using technology to buy and sell something as idiosyncratic as a house is a flip too farConsider the most serious suspect first: the housing market It has been in an unusual state of flux At first the covid-19 pandemic caused a freeze in all property transactions Then prices went berserk rising at record levels year on year in April Undoubtedly volatile prices do no favours to algorithms trained on historical data Still in theory rising prices should help i-buyers by making it harder to sell a house for less than was paid for it The reverse falling prices could be a more likely culprit but as yet the data are mixed A house-price index compiled by the National Association of Realtors NAR finds that values peaked in June 2021 at 19% above pre-pandemic levels and have since dropped by 28 percentage points Another by S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller suggests prices are still galloping ahead Both are published with a lag the NAR runs to the end of September Case-Shiller to the end of August which means the evidence is inconclusiveThe next suspect is the mathematical models A handful of firms offer i-buying services the first and biggest of which is Opendoor founded in 2014 They charge a fee for the services they provide: buying and selling homes immediately with zero fuss The quick in-and-out makes them more like marketmakers than property investors who buy to hold To succeed i-buying firms need two critical pieces of information: the current value of a home and a forecast of the price at sale time typically two to three months in the future To figure these out they need troves of data ranging from the precise location of a home to how many rooms it has to whether it has a pool or not They compare these with the closest comparable homes that have sold recently and look at recent trends to make a forecast That enables them to make an “instant” offer to a homeowner In the past the algorithms appear to have worked pretty well Mike DelPrete of the University of Colorado found they offered homeowners about 14% below market valuenot a bad outcome for a quick hassle-free saleZillow boss Rich Barton said the big problem was with the firm forecasts He claimed it had found itself unable to predict prices three-to-six months into the future In particular Zillow seems to have projected much rosier conditions than materialised In Phoenix where house-price appreciation has been particularly rapid but seems to be slowing Zillow is listing homes for an average of 62% less than it paid for themThis problem is exacerbated by the fickle economics of adverse selection Even if the algorithms of i-buying firms are excellent at pricing homes at a fair value on average they only need to be a little off for the risk to skew to the downside Homeowners will probably not sell their home for much less than they think it is worth but they will happily settle for a higher-than-expected price Mr Barton revealed in a shareholder letter on November 3rd that “higher-than anticipated conversion rates” were part of the problem One former Zillow employee has claimed that the company wanted around 50% of homeowners who sought an offer to take it but as many as 74% of offers made in recent months were taken up Zillow bought almost 10000 homes in the third quarter more than double the amount from the prior three-month period which itself was more than double the amount in the first quarter The suspicion is that Zillow algorithm was making overly generous offers and homeowners were rushing to take advantageThis may have been a Zillow problem not an i-buyer one however Some of Zillow competitors seemed to realise before Zillow that the market was losing steam OpenDoor and Offerpad an i-buyer founded in 2015 both began making more conservative offers relative to their models’ valuation around July as price appreciation began to cool When they reported their earnings on November 10th neither Opendoor nor Offerpad exhibited anything like the problems suffered by ZillowInside jobPerhaps the fatal blow was in fact self-inflicted Zillow expanded its i-buying business aggressively Opendoor expanded gradually It offered i-buying services in only six markets after three years taking its time to refine its algorithms It is now operational in 44 markets Zillow added almost as many markets in half as much time A former Zillow employee told Business Insider that management had been hellbent on catching up with Opendoor the front-runner In order to compete the employee alleged the company pushed to offer generous deals to potential clients It called this “Project Ketchup” Now it has its own fake blood on its hands 
 Nov 13th 2021,Cash is a low-yielding asset but has other virtues,EVER HAD the feeling that there is a party somewhere that you’re not invited to? It is the same feeling investors have when they have capital sitting in three-month bills or on deposit at a bank Cash is a safe asset but a wasting one The real returns on risky assets have been much greater True cash affords optionsto buy cheaply when others are selling But episodes of distressed selling have been fleeting largely thanks to central banks which have been liberal in supplying cash in emergencies Why then should investors incur the opportunity cost of holding it?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn its favour cash is at least now offering a small return or the prospect of one Overnight interest rates have risen notably in Latin America and Eastern Europe The Bank of England may raise its benchmark interest rate before the year is out The Federal Reserve may follow at some time next year But the rate of return in short-term money markets is still below the rate of inflation and is forecast to stay that way For those seeking returns holding cash remains a loss-making prospect in real termsThe true appeal of cash as a portfolio asset lies somewhere else More and more capital is tied up in investments where much of the payoff lies in the distant future You see this in the huge market capitalisations of a handful of tech companies in America and in the money flooding into private-equity and venture-capital funds Investors have to wait ever longer to get their money back In the meantime their portfolios are vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates A simple way to mitigate this risk is to hold more cashThe concept of “duration” is a useful one in this regard Duration is a measure of a bond lifespan It is related to but subtly different from the maturity of a bond Duration takes into account that some of what is due to bondholdersthe annual interest or “coupon”is paid out sooner than the principal which is handed over when the bond matures The longer you have to wait for coupon and principal payments the longer the duration It is also a gauge of how much the price of a bond changes as interest rates shift The greater a bond duration the more sensitive it is to a rise in interest ratesYou can also think of equity investment in duration terms Take the familiar price-earnings ratio or PE the price paid by investors for a given level of stockmarket earnings The idea is that if a stock has a PE of ten based on recent earnings it would take ten years to earn back the outlay of an investor who buys the stock today assuming earnings stay constant If the PE is 20 it would take 20 years The PE is thus a crude measure of the stock duration On this basis American stocks in aggregate have rarely had a longer duration The cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio a valuation measure popularised by Robert Shiller of Yale University is now close to 40 It was higher only at the giddy height of the dotcom boom in 1999-2000The rationale for longer-duration assets is a familiar one Real long-term interest rates are about as low as they have ever been As a consequence investment returns even in the distant future once discounted have a high value today It is not just stocks Property is valued at a steep price relative to the stream of future rents Investors are piling into private-equity and venture-capital funds that won’t pay out for a decade or more Everyone it seems is long duration But with longer duration comes a greater risk that unexpectedly aggressive interest-rate rises will lead to a collapse in asset valuesA typical investment portfolio of stocks bonds and property is vulnerable to this risk There are not too many good ways to hedge it Buying insurance in the options market against a stockmarket crash is expensive and fiddlyThis is where cash comes in Cash is by definition a short-duration asset Were interest rates to go up sharply cash holders would get the benefit quickly even as other assets suffer So as the duration of your portfolio rises it makes sense to raise your cash holdings too By precisely how much will depend as ever on your risk appetite Just as you are advised to sell down your stocks to the level where a night rest is assured you might also build up your cash holdings to the sleeping pointOf course such a strategy comes with an opportunity cost As long as asset markets continue to boom cash will be a drag on your portfolio So be it Missing out on some returns is the price you pay for mitigating duration riskFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Nov 8th 2021,China attempts to clean up its sleaziest regional banks,IT’S BEEN A bad year to be a big cheese in China Billionaire entrepreneurs have been hounded Over-extravagant entertainers have disappeared from the internet Now a new type of tycoon is feeling the heat The latest regulatory crackdown on what the government considers private-sector misbehaviour extends to businessmen with excessively cosy ties to banks The fear is that insider dealing preferential access to credit and lax corporate governance pose threats to stability particularly in the regional and local underbelly of China financial systemListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe most prominent red flag is Evergrande a debt-ridden property firm close to collapse that until recently had a 36% stake in Shengjing Bank a local lender based in the north-eastern province of Liaoning The authorities are said to be investigating whether Evergrande which is run by a billionaire Hui Ka Yan took control of Shengjing with about 1trn yuan $156bn in assets using illicit means as well as conducting some 100bn yuan in related-party transactionsAnother notorious case involves HNA Group an acquisitive conglomerate which took over Yingkou Coastal Bank in Liaoning in 2014 see chart 1 HNA put new leaders into the bank and transformed it into a mill for shadow-banking products that provided it and related groups with copious amounts of credit Its assets tripled in 2016 making it the fastest-growing bank in China that yearbefore it almost collapsed Since February HNA has been in bankruptcy administration Chen Feng its co-founder and chairman was arrested in September as was its CEOThe malaise goes far deeper posing a potential threat to economic stability in some Chinese provinces particularly rust-belt ones like Liaoning The 134 metropolitan and 1400-odd rural commercial banks in China make up about 32% of its commercial-banking sector with some 90trn yuan or $14trn in total assets That is almost the size of Britain entire banking system They exist in the shadow of China six big national-level banks and 12 joint-stock banks which are predominantly state-owned and have the most visibility Unlike the bigger banks during most of the past decade many of those in the lower tiers have sold ownership stakes to large private investors to the point of being under the influence of them In recent years some have become cesspools of bad debts insider dealing and failures of risk management which are often attributed to misaligned ownership incentivesThis has aroused the concern of regulators The central government is expediting a reform to push out what it calls “problem shareholders” from banks On October 15th the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission introduced rules that extended supervision of those that it considered to be banks’ controlling shareholders According to China Daily a government mouthpiece that extended to anyone holding a 10% stake or more in a city or local bank or those holding the largest equity stake in a bank or insurance company with ownership of no less than 5% The aim is to weed out over-cosy corporate interestsIf corporate shareholders are indeed the problem the authorities will have their hands full The Economist calculates that of 107 city commercial banks that disclosed financial information for 2020 72 with about 202trn yuan in total assets had large corporate shareholders many of which were property developers and manufacturers Twenty-two of this group were controlled outright by corporations and tycoons or had been until they were recently forced to restructure But even those with more than one large shareholder have attracted the attention of regulators The authorities are likely to be scrutinising the way investors compete with each other for preferential treatmentThe level of corporate ownership at rural commercial banks extends even furtherto the point that it has shocked some researchers Wang Chunyang of Peking University surveyed 1295 rural banks and found that 1122 or about 87% of them had private companies as their largest shareholders By our calculations that level of private ownership implies that up to 394trn yuan in rural-banking assets could be controlled or influenced by private interests For these banks identifying problems early is a challenge Smaller lenders are more likely to hide their bad debts says Ruan Tianyue of National University of Singapore creating a regulatory blind spotPrivate ownership of banks by itself is not the cause of the problem Some privately held banks such as the newly created Zhongbang Bank have performed well For their part many small government-controlled lenders have demonstrated abysmal risk controls But in banks lacking in corporate governance the risk is that the owners use their clout to extract loans on preferential terms undermining prudent risk management and increasing the level of bad debtsThat could have economic consequences Some experts liken the state of China small banks to that of the more than 1000 savings-and-loan institutions that collapsed in America in the mid-1980s due to deregulation and lax lending controls They say bad-debt problems among city and rural banks could hurt regional economic growthAnother problem is more political in nature As evidence grows of tycoons’ murky relationships with banks the more it plays into the narrative of President Xi Jinping that socialist command-and-control policies do a better job than private capital in allocating economic resourcesSigns of misbehaviour appear to be mushrooming Besides Evergrande which has been forced to sell some of its shares in Shengjing Hong Kong-listed Bank of Gansu required a bail-out last year after it lent to and invested heavily in the debt securities of one of its shareholders which eventually defaulted Bank of Jinzhou a north-eastern lender required an emergency restructuring after its largest shareholder to which it had extended many loans could no longer pay back creditors Anbang Insurance the unwieldy conglomerate best known outside China for buying the Waldorf Hotel in 2014 controlled Chengdu Rural Commercial Bank until 2020 Xiao Jianhua a tycoon who was kidnapped by Chinese agents from a Hong Kong hotel in 2017 controlled two lenders Baoshang Bank and Bank of Harbin both of which required expensive state bail-outsThese problems are unlikely to abate as China economy decelerates and more companies default In September shares in Fuxin Bank were put up for sale in an online auction meant to help raise capital for the struggling lender after a property developer with shares in the company could no longer repay its debts Bank of Langfang faces a potential increase in bad debts after its second-largest shareholder China Fortune Land a developer defaulted on a 53bn yuan bond earlier this yearRegulators take several approaches towards weeding out miscreant ownersof varying severity One is to push out problematic shareholders In mid-2020 the banking regulator published a list of 38 “illegal shareholders” that it had forced to divest Another is detention Mr Xiao for instance is thought to be currently held in Shanghai where he is assisting in the unwinding of his business operations A third is the death sentence Cai Guohua former chairman of Hengfeng Bank which required a bail-out in 2020 was handed a suspended death sentence for among other things taking illegal loansAuthorities have no intention of forcing all private shareholders out of the banks but they are moving to ensure that the largest shareholders come from the state says Lian Ping of Bank of Communications a large Chinese bank This will mean an upheaval across the industry given how prevalent large private shareholders have become in recent years Such regulatory actions will take time and will need to avoid undermining depositor confidence at banksIn some regions such as the north-east the government has sought to restructure handfuls of banks at a time possibly worried about a regional concentration of debt woes S&P Global a ratings agency says that nearly 8% of the loan books of the most prominent city and rural lenders in the north-east were non-performing or of questionable status in 2020 The figure was just 3% for the loan books of similar banks in eastern China see chart 2The north-east has one of the highest rates of private ownership in the country In Liaoning province for example eight of its 15 city commercial banks are privately controlled That produced a drive for consolidation After the HNA debacle Yingkou Coastal Bank became the central pillar of an effort to merge banks in Liaoning At first regulators went so far as to attempt to bring together 12 of Liaoning banks But later this ambition was downsized to two including YingkouFor all the regulatory overdrive the neatest solution continues to evade Chinese regulators: allowing banks to fail and exit the market Not since the collapse of

 Nov 6th 2021,Cautionary tales from high-inflation emerging economies,IN RECENT MONTHS the world economy has come to resemble a badly microwaved dinner: generally hot but with some bits merely lukewarm and others positively scorching Consumer prices globally are likely to rise by 48% this year according to the IMF which would be the fastest increase since 2007 But price rises in emerging markets are running ahead of those in the rich world and a few unfortunates such as Argentina Brazil and Turkey are feeling particular pain Their experience helps illustrate how and when inflation can get out of handListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAlthough inflation rates in emerging markets tend to be higher and more volatile than those in advanced economies they did generally decline between the 1970s and the 2010s much like those in the rich world The median inflation rate among emerging economies fell from 106% in 1995 to 54% in 2005 and 27% in 2015 thanks to efficiency-boosting developments like globalisation and improved macroeconomic policymaking The IMF expects consumer prices in emerging economies to rise by 58% this year which is not a huge departure from recent trends; prices rose at a similar pace as recently as 2012 But some economies have strayed well above the mean Inflation stands at 102% in Brazil 199% in Turkey and 525% in ArgentinaSuch high inflation reflects more than soaring food and energy prices In advanced economies and many emerging ones a jump in prices usually triggers a restraining response from the central bank That response is more powerful when central banks are credible say because inflation has been low in the past and the fiscal picture benign Then people behave as if a price spike will not lastby moderating wage demands for instancewhich reduces inflationary pressureThis happy state can be disturbed in a number of ways Compromising the independence of the central bank is sometimes enough to make the temperature rise Recep Tayyip Erdogan Turkey president has declared himself an enemy of interest earnings and leant on the central bank to reduce its benchmark rate a step he claims will bring down inflation Over the years he has sacked a number of central-bank officials most recently three members of the bank monetary-policy committee in October Such antics have contributed to capital outflows and a tumbling lira see chart The sinking currency by raising the cost of imports has helped push up inflation by about eight percentage points over the past year to a rate around four times the central bank targetBrazil demonstrates how inflation can get out of hand despite the best efforts of a central bank because of fiscal woes After suffering hyperinflation in the early 1990s when the annual inflation rate approached 3000% Brazil placed itself on a firmer macroeconomic footing by adopting budget reforms and enhancing the central bank independence But from 2014 to 2016 and again over the past year the ability of the central bank to fight inflation has been threatened by an erosion of confidence in the public financesGovernment spending in Brazil has surged since the onset of the pandemic Jair Bolsonaro the president plans to extend relief payments despite roaring inflation Worries about debt sustainability have reduced investors’ confidence leading to falling asset prices and a weaker currency Despite booming foreign demand for Brazil commodity exports the real has tumbled by nearly 30% since the beginning of 2020Higher import prices have contributed to stubbornly high inflation forcing the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by nearly six percentage points since March Yet interest rates may be approaching levels at which the additional fiscal cost they impose on the government exacerbates debt-sustainability worries and further weakens the currency leaving the central bank in a no-win situation The real has dropped by nearly 25% since late October aloneafter the central bank raised interest rates by a full 15 percentage points and promised to do the same again at its next meeting in DecemberWhat happens if neither monetary nor fiscal policy can be counted upon for economic discipline? Here Argentina provides an illustration The government has long relied on the printing press to cover budget deficits and has been in particular need of monetary financing since defaulting on its debt for the ninth time in its history in May 2020 Over the past two years the amount of money in circulation has risen at an average annual rate of more than 50% The peso has fallen by over 60% against the dollar since the beginning of last yearArgentina like Brazil has experienced hyperinflation in recent times Its economic situation may yet be salvaged But as policymakers in rich and poor countries alike confront the enormous economic and budgetary costs of covid-19 some may be tempted to depart from norms around monetary and fiscal policy The result in some unhappy places could be inflation that is too hot to handle For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Nov 6th 2021,A quantum walk down Wall Street,FINANCE AND physics have long been productive bedfellows When he wasn’t writing the laws of mechanics and gravity Isaac Newton ran the Royal Mint making coins harder to forge and forcing counterfeiters to the gallows The quantitative tools developed in 1900 by Louis Bachelier to study the French stockmarket were taken up by Albert Einstein to prove the existence of atoms Norbert Wiener formalised them into a mathematical framework that remains at the heart of today financial modelsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet finance has been slower to absorb other big ideas from 20th-century physics That is perhaps unsurprising because they are generally bizarre Fire a beam of electrons through two slits onto a screen and they will pass through both at once travelling as a wave but arriving as particles Concentrate enough energy in a region of space and matter and antimatter pop out of the void Introduce the right two particles to each other and they pop back into itAll this seems worlds away from the mundane reality of traders tapping out buy and sell orders on their keyboards But on a closer look finance bears a striking resemblance to the quantum world A beam of light might seem continuous but is in fact a stream of discrete packets of energy called photons Cash flows come in similarly distinct chunks Like the position of a particle the true price of an asset is unknowable without making a measurementa transactionthat in turn changes it In both fields uncertainty or risk is best understood not as a peripheral source of error but as the fundamental feature of the systemSuch similarities have spawned a niche area of research known as quantum finance In a forthcoming book “Money Magic and How to Dismantle a Financial Bomb” David Orrell one of its leading proponents surveys the landscape Mr Orrell argues that modelling markets with the mathematical toolbox of quantum mechanics could lead to a better understanding of themClassical financial models are rooted in the mathematical idea of the random walk They start by dividing time into a series of steps then imagine that at each step the value of a risky asset like a stock can go up or down by a small amount Each jump is assigned a probability After many steps the probability distribution for the asset price looks like a bell curve centred on a point determined by the cumulative relative probabilities of the moves up and the moves downA quantum walk works differently Rather than going up or down at each step the asset price evolves as a “superposition” of the two possibilities never nailed down unless measured in a transaction At each step the various possible paths interfere like waves sometimes amplifying each other and sometimes cancelling out This interference creates a very different probability distribution for the asset final price to that generated by the classical model The bell curve is replaced by a series of peaks and troughsBroadly speaking the classical random walk is a better description of how asset prices move But the quantum walk better explains how investors think about their movements when buying call options which confer the right to buy an asset at a given “strike” price on a future date A call option is generally much cheaper than its underlying asset but gives a big pay-off if the asset price jumps The scenarios foremost in the buyer mind are not a gentle drift in the price but a large move up from which they want to benefit or a big drop to which they want to limit their exposureThe potential return is particularly juicy for options with strikes much higher than the prevailing price Yet investors are much more likely to buy those with strikes close to the asset market price The prices of such options closely match those predicted by an algorithm based on the classical random walk in part because that is the model most traders accept But a quantum walk by assigning such options a higher value than the classical model explains buyers’ preference for themSuch ideas may still sound abstract But they will soon be physically embodied on trading floors whether the theory is adopted or not Quantum computers which replace the usual zeros and ones with superpositions of the two are nearing commercial viability and promise faster calculations Any bank wishing to retain its edge will need to embrace them Their hardware meanwhile makes running quantum-walk models easier than classical ones One way or another finance will catch upFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Nov 6th 2021,Do “greedy jobs” cause the gender pay gap?,RADICAL AND liberal feminists as defined by philosophers differ on the extent to which women freely made choices matter A liberal feminist desires maximum autonomy for women demanding equal rights and an end to sex discrimination A radical feminist sees in society patriarchal forces that are bigger than any one person and which oppress women in part by influencing their choices Economic differences between the sexessuch as the gender pay gapare always a sign of injusticeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA new book by Claudia Goldin of Harvard University an expert on women and work is a study both of American women choices and of the context in which they are made “Career and Family: Women Century-Long Journey Toward Equity” traces the history of work and family for college-educated women and diagnoses what still troubles their careers todayA caricature of history might involve a journey from home to the workplace In fact the first generation Ms Goldin studies born in 1878-97 contained plenty of working women But a successful career typically required forgoing children and sometimes marriage Among those listed in “Notable American Women” a collection of biographies no more than three in ten had a child she writes The choice women faced was “family or career”By the third generation those born between 1924 and 1943 college-educated women had a more uniform life experience: “family then job” The typical woman worked after graduation but soon married had children and dropped out of the workforce She returned once her children were in school and the gradual removal of formal discriminatory barriers opened up opportunities for her But her prolonged absence from work meant she did not have the skills and experience necessary to thrive in the workplaceIt is only by the fifth group born after 1958 that many women aspired to achieve “career and family” The shift was aided by the contraceptive pill which helped women delay marriage; improved fertility treatments which helped them delay child-bearing; and more liberal social norms Yet despite the staggering extent of the change Ms Goldin documents a clear gender gap still exists for these women most notably with respect to pay American women earn on average 20% less per hour worked For college graduates the gap is larger at 26%It is at this point that the book becomes provocative Drawing on reams of research Ms Goldin argues that most women no longer suffer much labour-market discrimination in the sense of unequal pay for equal performance as is often claimed by the left Nor is the gender pay gap driven primarily by women choice of occupation an explanation sometimes favoured by the right Even if the distribution of women occupations matched that of men“if women were the doctors and men were the nurses”she calculates that at most a third of the pay gap would disappearThe most important cause is that women curtail their careers as a part of a rational household response to labour markets which generously reward anyone male or female who is willing to hold down what Ms Goldin calls a “greedy job” These are roles such as those in law accountancy and finance that demand long and unpredictable hours Parents need somebody to be on-call at home in case a child falls ill and needs picking up from school or needs cheering on at a concert or football match That is incompatible with a greedy job which requires being available for last-minute demands from a client or boss No one person can do both The rational response is for one parent to specialise in lucrative greedy work and for the othertypically the motherto prioritise the children Ms Goldin writes that “couple equity has been and will continue to be jettisoned for increased family income”A gender pay gap resulting primarily from the choices of households is a thorny problem for liberals who prize freedom of choice It is also tricky territory for economists who often emphasise the “revealed preference” of those they study and the resulting efficiency of market outcomes True to her membership of the Chicago school of conservative-leaning economists Ms Goldin does not offer the confident prescriptions for the expansion of government that could have easily followed her compelling diagnosis of the problem Some parts of her book suggest she supports more subsidies for child care like those proposed by President Joe Biden But speaking to The Economist she was more circumspect pointing out that among Mr Biden proposals she would prioritise cash transfers to parents a policy that makes no attempt to change households’ choices The book is about “what happened and why” she says rather than solutionsFor love or moneyAnother theme of the book however is just how much progress for women is a result of technological change and innovation Could similar forces disrupt greediness? For some jobs it is hard to see how; little can stop the self-employed pouring hours into their businesses say But firms have an incentive to make jobs less greedy because hiring and promoting mothers means drawing from a bigger pool of talent Ms Goldin points to pharmacy as an example of an industry that has made the transition Many pharmacists used to be self-employed with customers expecting personal service But computers and consolidation have led to pharmacists becoming more substitutable for each other making the job less greedy without a loss of status or pay Perhaps remote work or artificial intelligence will do the same for other professionsLike a radical Ms Goldin has identified a structural feature of the economy: “It isn’t you it the system” she reassures the reader But she has the liberal hesitancy about disrupting a system that is built on choice 
 Nov 4th 2021,The bond markets v central banks,FOR MUCH of the past two years central bankers have found themselves playing second fiddle to governments With interest rates in the rich world near or below zero even before the pandemic surges in public spending were needed to see economies through lockdowns Now central bankers are firmly in the limelight During the past month as inflation has soared investors have rapidly brought forward their expectations for the date at which interest rates will rise testing policymakers’ promises to keep rates lowListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe expected date of lift-off in some countries is now years earlier In the last days of October Australia two-year government-bond yield jumped from around 01% to nearly 08% roughly the level at which five-year bonds had traded as recently as September prompting the central bank to throw in the towel on its pledge to keep three-year yields ultra-low The bank formally ditched its policy of yield-curve control on November 2nd though it said it would wait for sustained inflation to emerge before raising interest ratesOn October 27th the Bank of Canada announced the end of its bond-buying scheme though it will still reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities The bond market had already reached the same conclusion before the announcement and is pricing in a small interest-rate increase over the next year Investors’ expectations for rate rises in Britain have ratcheted up dramatically see chart As we wrote this the Bank of England was due to decide whether to raise its policy rateSuch moves have been mirrored in America and the euro area albeit on a smaller scale The Federal Reserve announced a tapering of its asset purchases on November 3rd That had been widely expected but the MOVE index which tracks the volatility of American interest rates has this month hit its highest level since the early days of the pandemic On October 28th Christine Lagarde the head of the European Central Bank pressed back against market expectations that interest-rate increases could begin as soon as the second half of 2022 noting that an early rise would be inconsistent with the bank guidance That failed to stop two-year German bond yields inching up the day after to their highest level since January 2020The movements so far are not large enough to constitute a bond-market tantrum on the scale of that seen in 2013 when the Fed also announced a taper But the fact that the mood is much more febrile than it has been for most of this year reflects the uncertainty over the economic outlook particularly that for inflationWhether the markets prove to be right on the timing of interest-rate rises or whether central bankers instead keep their original promises will depend on how persistent inflation looks likely to be Central bankers have said that price rises so far are transient reflecting an intense supply crunch But some onlookers believe that a new inflationary era may be on the way in which more powerful workers and faster wage growth place sustained pressure on prices “Instead of decades in which labour has been coming out of people ears it going to be quite hard to find it and that going to raise bargaining power” says Charles Goodhart a former rate-setter at the Bank of EnglandRecent moves also highlight the sometimes-complex relationship between financial markets and monetary policy In normal times central bankers set short-term interest rates and markets try to forecast where those rates could go But bond markets might also contain information on investors’ expectations about the economy and inflation which central bankers for their part try to parse Ben Bernanke a former chairman of the Fed once referred to the risk of a “hall of mirrors” dynamic in which policymakers feel the need to respond to rising bond yields while yields in turn respond to central banks’ actionsAll this makes central bankers’ lives even harder as they try to penetrate a fog of economic uncertainty Yet there is some small relief to be had too If investors thought inflation had become sustained instead of being driven largely by commodity prices and supply-chain snarls yields on long-dated government bonds would have begun to move significantly So far however investors have dragged interest-rate increases forward rather than baking in the expectation of permanently tighter monetary policy The ten-year American Treasury yield for instance is still not back to its recent highs in MarchFurthermore some bond markets are still calm In Japan consumer prices were just 02% higher in September than a year ago and are still in deflationary territory once energy and fresh food are stripped out The Bank of Japan yield-curve-control policy remains in place contrasting with the collapse in Australia Setting policy is a little easier when investors are more certain of the outlook That sadly is not a luxury many central bankers have For more expert analysis of the biggest

 Nov 4th 2021,Even after a weak patch America economy is still in high gear,MANAGERS AT HUB GROUP a transport company used to be able to click a few buttons at their headquarters in Illinois and eight weeks later receive a new shipping container from China ready for use in America Recently though Phillip Yeager the firm president faced a headache After a long wait at the congested port of Long Beach its container was at last next in line to go ashore But the ship in front did not have a chassis for moving its freight and was blocking the landing berth Mr Yeager team scrambled to find a chassis for it Only then could Hub get its container a full month lateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMultiply by thousands of containers and the tale helps explain how supply chains have become so snarled particularly in America the world biggest consumer market And this is just one of the cross-cutting forces buffeting the economy Demand for goods is incredibly strong but companies are struggling to find workers and supplies which in turn is pushing up wages and prices all against a backdrop in which the pandemicthe original cause of the distortionsis fading but not gone And officials poised to withdraw the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past 18 months are throwing another element into the fray At the end of its policy meeting on November 3rd the Federal Reserve said that it would start paring back its $120bn monthly bond-buying programme putting it on track to halt all purchases by June next yearAll this makes for a volatile mix as was illustrated by third-quarter GDP published on October 28th The economy grew at an annual rate of 2% compared with the previous three months That depending on your frame of reference was either most impressive or very disappointing Compared with forecasts made in late 2020 growth during the first three quarters of this year has been more than a third faster than projected But forecasts had zoomed higher since: at one point economists expected third-quarter growth to be more than three times as fast as it actually wasThe fourth quarter may bring a bounce-back Consumer confidence fell precipitously as the summer wore on and the Delta variant took hold Now Delta is receding and confidence rebounding which bodes well for shopping and travelling during the holiday season Supply chains though still far from normal may be improving a bit Mr Yeager talks of better “network fluidity” with more trains arriving on time and warehouses running more efficiently Analysts at Bank of America reckon that growth could pick up to an annual rate of 6% over the final three months of the yearAny near-term rebound aside however how much longer before the recovery runs out of air? Three big factors suggest that it may be nearing its end: a tight labour market stubbornly high inflation and a rapid unwinding of stimulus Yet there is also cause to think that each will not undercut the recovery and that growth momentum may remain strongEasily the most positive economic development of the past year has been the remarkable decline in unemployment After a recession the labour market usually takes years to heal Things looked grim at the height of the pandemic when unemployment soared to 147% the highest rate since the Depression Yet the return to work albeit not to offices has been astonishingly strong The unemployment rate 48% in September is low for this point in a recovery see chart 1Indeed the focus now is on how hard it is for companies to hire workers especially for blue-collar jobs That might suggest that the recovery is nearing an end with the economy straining at its limits Yet some slack remains About 3m people 2% of the pre-pandemic labour force have still to return to work Some may have retired early but many are on the sidelines concerned about child care and catching covid-19 As those concerns diminishthe return to school has gone well so far and vaccines are proving effective against severe illnesssuch people are little by little resuming workThe surge in inflation presents another big worry about the recovery see chart 2 The personal consumption expenditures price index the Fed preferred gauge increased by 44% in September from a year earlier the most in more than three decades For much of the past year officials at the Fed and many other economists too have argued that inflation is transitory an outgrowth of gummed-up supply chainsThe tight job market however complicates the picture Wages rose by 15% in the third quarter compared with the second the biggest gain in at least two decades Welcome as it is to see nurses and waiters get pay bumps the fear is that rising wages will lead to yet more upward pressure on prices and ultimately to a dreaded wage-price spiral as experienced in the 1970s But conditions are very different Far fewer workers are represented by unions today and far fewer contracts have cost-of-living adjustments baked into them That should weaken the link between inflation and pay The Fed may have been unduly optimistic in thinking that price pressures would quickly subside but its logic remains persuasive As supply chains slowly return to normal and as people re-enter the labour force inflation should ebb without the need for forceful interest-rate risesRelated to that is the final big concern: the withdrawal of stimulus With the fiscal deficit hitting 15% of GDP in 2020 the highest level since the second world war the comedown was bound to be painful The shift to smaller deficits will deduct about 25 percentage points from growth over the next year easily the biggest fiscal drag of the past two decades according to the Hutchins Centre on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Washington see chart 3The monetary cliff will not be as steep but it now looms over the economy The next question after tapering is when the Fed will raise interest rates On October 29th Goldman Sachs a bank said that the first rate rise could come as soon as July a full year earlier than it had previously forecast because of its expectation that inflation will remain elevatedAn end to stimulus would usually augur poorly for growth Yet other factors could insulate the economy The consumption of goods is about 15% higher than its trend level partly because people have spent much less money than usual on holidays and restaurants and much more on furniture exercise bikes and stay-at-home essentials But with the pandemic now apparently petering out people are buying experiences againa fillip for growth given that services account for nearly 80% of outputEven without any more stimulus cheques momentum for spending is strong Jay Bryson of Wells Fargo another bank says that the strength of household balance-sheets should be the starting point in any analysis of America growth prospects Personal debt obligations as a share of disposable income are near their lowest on record Business inventories are also near all-time lows implying substantial need for restocking if only companies can get the goods they need on time “Knowing what I know today I would say that we are still in the early stages of this recovery” says Mr BrysonMr Yeager has reached a similar conclusion As retailers rush to restock their shelves Hub order books are filling up fast It has even had to turn some prospective clients away “We think the strength really does carry through to the end of next year and potentially beyond” he says For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterAn early version of this article was published online on October 31st 2021
 Oct 30th 2021,China long wait for a tax everyone loves to hate,IF SUN YAT-SEN had got his way China would have been a bold pioneer in the taxation of real estate During his exile in Europe from 1896 to 1898 the republican revolutionary fell under the spell of Henry George an influential American journalist who believed a single tax on land should replace all others Sun hoped pre-industrial China could adopt such innovations more easily than the West because it was “unimpeded by the opposition of entrenched capital” as one scholar put itListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKInstead China has become a timid procrastinator in the taxation of real estate particularly of the property built on top of land as opposed to the land itself It first proposed a recurring tax on the value of property in 2003 And it introduced a half-baked pilot scheme in the cities of Shanghai and Chongqing in 2011 The tax was included in the five-year legislative plan of the National People Congress NPC China rubber-stamp parliament in 2015 But things went no further Reform it seems was impeded by the opposition of entrenched interests including no doubt many officials who would prefer not to declare their properties let alone pay taxes on themBut in August Xi Jinping China president expressed support for a property tax as part of his campaign to curb excessive wealth and promote “common prosperity” And on October 23rd the NPC said pilot schemes would be expanded to new cities although it did not say when or whichSuch a tax is sorely needed China raises little money from its personal-income taxes which are too easily avoided Indirect levies such as the value-added tax are more lucrative but regressive Local governments in particular lack a stable source of revenue which leaves them heavily reliant on land sales and transfers from the central government Although China does impose a variety of property-related taxes including one on the purchase of land these levies fall more heavily on the construction and trading of real estate than on the possession of it As China property market matures and its economy moves beyond breakneck urban expansion housebuilding and selling will provide fewer feathers to pluckThe tax could also ameliorate some of the perversities of China economic model About a fifth of its urban housing stood vacant in 2017 according to the China Household Finance Survey led by Li Gan of Texas A&M University A property tax would make it more costly to buy second or third homes and keep them empty in the hope of selling them on for a higher price It could therefore discourage speculation and invigorate China underdeveloped rental marketBut a property tax will also be unpopular It is the tax “everyone loves to hate” as Jay Rosengard of Harvard University has put it Such taxes are not discreetly withheld from a paycheque or embedded in a product price Payments can be lumpy conspicuous and irksome especially if the taxpayer doubts that bureaucrats will spend the money well As property prices have raced ahead of incomes many homeowners may also be “asset-rich” but relatively “cash-poor” In 2019 for example a property tax of 12% would have eaten up over 10% of the average urban resident disposable incomeSome people also fear that the tax will crash the market That seems unlikely It will be some time before any revenue is actually collected And the tax is not the only lever that policymakers can pull China cities impose a variety of other impediments and deterrents to property purchases including hefty downpayment requirements limits on the purchase of additional flats and rules that oblige buyers to show a history of local social-security contributions If a property tax were to weigh too heavily on the market these prudential limits could be easedThe bigger danger is that the tax will do too little not too much to cool speculation The Chongqing tax which is levied chiefly on detached and high-end properties and exempts the first 100 square metres of space depressed prices by 25% a year relative to where they would have been according to a study in 2015 by Zaichao Du and Lin Zhang of Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in Chengdu But prices still rose on average Shanghai tax had no effect on prices at allProgress and procrastinationTo make them more palatable the Chongqing and Shanghai pilot taxes were both patchy and complicated The new pilot cities should try cleaner designs Any flaws kinks or ill-judged exemptions can be difficult to fix later Indonesia Mr Rosengard has pointed out decided to keep its effective property tax at a meagre 01% while it collected better data on property ownership and values Yet even after the data improved it found it difficult to raise the rate Britain property tax in the 1980s was based on increasingly anachronistic rental values But the government was so reluctant to update them that it introduced a disastrous “poll” tax instead Ontario in Canada spent 30 years talking about reforming its property tax before eventually taking the plunge in 1998 as detailed by Richard Bird and Enid Slack of the University of TorontoSun Yat-sen hoped that China

 Oct 30th 2021,Why currency volatility could make a comeback,FOREIGN-EXCHANGE markets were once a hotbed of lively speculative activity But today traders seeking an adrenalin fix must turn to assets like cryptocurrencies instead Barring a brief surge early in the pandemicand isolated goings-on in the Turkish liracurrency markets have gone quiet Macro-trading funds no longer strike fear into central bankers and finance ministries with speculative attacks The last sudden end to a major currency pegthat of the Swiss franc in 2015was a result of the central bank taking investors by surprise rather than the other way roundListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRock-bottom inflation and interest rates over the past decade helped smother swings in exchange rates Deutsche Bank CVIX index a gauge of forex volatility has been above its current level more than 90% of the time over the past 20 years By contrast the VIX which measures expected volatility for America S&P 500 index of stocks and is often used as a measure of overall market sentiment has so far spent October at roughly its long-term average But as consumer prices and interest rates go up currency volatility could well stage a return with potentially unwelcome consequences for some investorsThe strangeness of the recovery from the pandemic makes predicting the path of policy especially hard Yet some divergences seem likely to reassert themselves Countries are recovering at different speeds and central banks are displaying varying levels of discomfort with inflation Policy in America is especially important given the pivotal role of the dollar: 88% of over-the-counter foreign-exchange trades in 2019 involved the greenback according to the Bank for International Settlements The chances that the Federal Reserve turns more rapidly to policy tightening are rising Break-evens the gap between yields on inflation-protected Treasury bonds and conventional ones of the same maturity point to annual inflation of around 3% over the next five years the highest reading since at least 2003 By contrast no one is expecting interest-rate rises for decades in Japan where year-on-year inflation excluding food and energy is negativeLong periods of low volatility are understandably regarded as a good thing by most investors But they can have less desirable side-effects Hyman Minsky an economist suggested that periods of financial stability and sustained profits can change the behaviour of market participants by pushing them to adopt riskier strategies that could in turn destabilise markets The danger is that as currency markets return to life the shortcomings of these sorts of strategies are exposedThe boom in Asian economies in the 1990s which led to enormous unhedged dollar borrowing by governments and firms is a case study in how the perception of safety once overturned can cause violent market reactions Faced with steep currency depreciation in 1997-98 that borrowing proved impossible to service spurring defaults and bail-outs Today emerging-market governments issue far more of their debt in their own currencies and when they borrow in foreign currency do so at longer maturities Still weak spots remain Dollar borrowing by non-banks in the developing world has almost doubled to over $4trn in the past decade much of it reflecting bond issuance by companies rather than governmentsCreditors too are vulnerable to exchange-rate risk Working out the extent to which asset-owners hedge their exposures is tricky But the available figures indicate that falling volatility tends to cause companies to reduce hedging Large Japanese insurers have tended to hedge more over the past two decades whenever volatility has risen suggests Fed research published last year Insurers bought far more currency forwards and swaps during and immediately after the global financial crisis when volatility peaked and a declining share relative to their foreign assets thereafter Unhedged net foreign assets in Australia too have risen in the past couple of decades in part reflecting the rise of non-bank borrowers that are unprotectedAn optimist might point to the market stress of the early days of the pandemic when volatility surged without causing big currency-market blow-ups If the system was able to weather acute distress then why worry now? But placidity was restored in short order last year because central banks were unusually co-ordinated in their easing Now by contrast they are preparing to go their separate ways Currency markets may no longer be an oasis of calmFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 30th 2021,Remote-first work is taking over the rich world,IN FEBRUARY 2020 Americans on average spent 5% of their working hours at home By May as lockdowns spread the share had soared to 60%a trend that was mirrored in other countries Many people perhaps believing that working from home really meant shirking from home assumed that office life would soon return to something like its pre-pandemic norm To say it has not turned out that way would be a huge understatementListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMost office workers remain steadfastly “remote-first” spending most of their paid time out of the office Even though a large share of people have little choice but to physically go to work 40% of all American working hours are still now spent at home In mid-October American offices were just over a third full suggest data from Kastle Systems a security firm From Turin to Tokyo commercial areas of cities remain substantially quieter compared with pre-covid norms than residential ones Economists are trying to work out what all this means for productivityPerceptions about the future of office work are changing Last year British government ministers exhorted workers to get back to the office; now they are quieter Wall Street banks often the most enthusiastic advocates for in-office work are toning down the rhetoric According to a monthly survey by Jose Maria Barrero Nick Bloom and Steven Davis three economists bosses expect that in a post-pandemic world an average of 13 days a week will be worked from homea quarter more than they expected when asked the same question in January Even that could in time prove to be an underestimate Workers hope they will spend closer to half their working hours at the kitchen tableA few factors explain why remote-first work remains dominant Many people remain scared of contracting covid-19 and thus wish to avoid public spaces Another possibility is that workers have more bargaining power In a world of labour shortages it takes a brave boss to make people take a sweaty commute five days a week workers view being forced to be in the office full-time as equivalent to a 5% pay cut There is a more intriguing possibility however Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient compared with an office-first modelThe past year has seen an explosion of research on the economics of working from home Not all the papers find a positive impact on productivity A recent paper by Michael Gibbs of the University of Chicago and colleagues studies an Asian IT-services company When the firm shifted to remote work last year average hours rose but output fell slightly The authors ascribe part of the decline in productivity to “higher communication and co-ordination costs” For instance managers who had once popped their head round someone door may have found it harder to convey precisely what they needed when everyone was working remotelyMost studies however find more positive results Mr Barrero and his colleagues’ surveys cover a large number of firms rather than just one Only 15% of home-workers believe they are less efficient working in this way than they were on business premises before the pandemic according to a paper published by the team in April A study released that month by Statistics Canada finds that more than half of “new” remote workers ie those who normally worked outside the home before the pandemic reported completing about the same amount of work per hour as before while one-third said they got more doneEconomists have less insight into why remote workers might be more productive One possibility is that they can more easily focus on tasks than in an office where the temptation to gossip with a co-worker looms large Commuting moreover is tiring Another factor relates to technology Remote workers by necessity rely more on tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams This may allow bosses to co-ordinate teams more effectively if the alternative in the office was word-of-mouth instructions that could easily be forgotten or misinterpreted Patent applications for work-from-home technologies are soaring while American private-sector investment in IT is growing by 14% year-on-yearYet the popularity of remote-first work presents a puzzle If it is so wonderful then why is there little evidence of a shift towards “fully remote” work where firms shut down their offices altogether? Companies that have chosen to do this are in a tiny minority The number of people moving to cities such as Tulsa in Oklahoma which is positioning itself as the global capital of remote work remains smallPerhaps it is only a matter of time before everyone who can goes fully remote A new study in Nature Human Behaviour howeversuggests that firms have good reason to hold on to their office buildings even if they are used less frequently The paper studies the communications including instant messages and video calls of 60000 Microsoft employees in 2019-20 Remote work makes people collaboration practices more “static and siloed” it finds People interact more with their closest contacts but less with the more marginal members of their networks who can offer them new perspectives and ideas That probably hurts innovation The upshot is that fully remote teams might do quite well in the short term but will ultimately suffer as innovation dries upWhat a way to make a livingHow best to collaborate then in a remote-first world? Many firms assume it is enough for everyone to come into the office a few days a week since this will lead to people bumping into each other and talking about ideas Others backed by stronger evidence say that managers must be more intentional and bring people together with the express purpose of discussing new ideas Firms will have to experiment as they get used to a new way of working and the precise arrangement may vary depending on the type of work What seems clear though is that offices will still have a role after the pandemiceven if they are mostly empty For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterDig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe/
 Oct 30th 2021,The Democrats target companies with giant profits but tiny tax bills,ON THE FACE of things it seems both absurd and unfair that large American companies regularly whittle down their tax bills taking advantage of every loophole on offer One study found that at least 55 big companies incurred no federal taxes at all on their profits in 2020 A proposal being discussed as The Economist went to press and as the Democratic Party scrambled to fund its social-spending package seems to offer a popular solution: a minimum tax on corporate earnings as reported to shareholders rather than as massaged down when reported to tax collectorsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe structure of the minimum tax looks simple enough Companies that report more than $1bn in profits to shareholders would pay a tax of at least 15% on those profits The levy would be explicitly aimed at firms such as Amazon which had an effective federal income-tax rate of just 43% from 2018 to 2020 far below the statutory rate of 21% according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a left-leaning think-tank All told the new tax would apply to some 200 big companiesPolitically the minimum corporate tax has much going for it Angus King an independent senator who is an architect of the proposal believes it could raise $400bn over ten years That would help fund the bill that is the cornerstone of President Joe Biden “Build Back Better” agenda featuring about $2trn in spending over the next decade equivalent to less than 1% of projected GDP during that time The corporate minimum is also less controversial than another new levy the Democrats were rowing over a tax on unrealised capital gains that would target 700 billionairesDemocrats had hoped at first to rely on a general increase in the corporate-tax rate to raise revenues But Kyrsten Sinema a Democratic senator from Arizona whose support is needed for the bill to pass opposed the wider increase and has instead backed the minimum tax as “commonsense” The idea also has the approval of Joe Manchin a Democratic senator from West Virginia whose vote could prove decisiveThe economic rationale is however more dubious Despite its apparently simple structure it would introduce more complexity into an already bloated tax code Companies would face two parallel systems calculating their liabilities first under regular tax rules and then under the minimum-tax regime An earlier version of a minimum corporate tax repealed under President Donald Trump in 2017 was so onerous that in some years compliance costs outstripped tax collectionsThe gap between taxable income and book income as reported to shareholders exists for a reason When say a company builds a factory financial rules require it to spread the cost over many years based on depreciation letting investors know the value of its assets Tax rules however let firms report costs when incurred That lowers tax bills when investments are made and encourages more spendingCalculating minimum taxes based on book rather than taxable income would lead to two perverse outcomes First powers over tax would in effect be granted to the Financial Accounting Standards Board an unelected body that governs how companies report income Changes in its standards would lead to changes in taxationSecond companies would have less scope for deducting investment expenses and hence might pare back capital spending Mr Biden though does not want that to happen so the proposal maintains several deductions including for spending on clean energy and on research and developmentone of the provisions that may have allowed Amazon to lower its taxesCompanies for their part will adapt By turning more to debt instead of equity markets for financing for instance they could increase their interest expenses which would eat into both their book and taxable incomes The upshot is that the minimum corporate tax may end up raising far less revenue than its proponents believe while also skewing investment incentivesand making a messy tax code even more complicated For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Oct 30th 2021,As energy prices spike governments reach for the dirtiest tool in the box,“THIS REFORM will increase our energy securityand it will help us combat the threat posed by climate change” Those hopeful words were uttered by Barack Obama then America president at the end of a meeting of the G20 group of countries in Pittsburgh in 2009 The gathered leaders had agreed to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels which by encouraging the use of polluting fuels tilt the playing field against cleaner alternatives Twelve years later however fossil-fuel subsidies are still hanging on And as a severe energy-supply crunch leads to soaring prices around the world they are making something of a comebackListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMinisters from the European Union held an emergency meeting this week to discuss how to respond to the price spikes but failed to agree on a plan National politicians however are turning to subsidies and price caps Italy is considering spending more than €5bn $58bn or 03% of GDP this year and next to reduce the price of natural gas and power for consumers France will extend its cap on household-gas prices until the end of next yearMost people would agree that fossil-fuel subsidies should in principle be ditched But no politician wants to expose voters to pain at home or at the petrol pump Even before the energy crisis the politics of subsidies were veering off track BloombergNEF a research outfit and Bloomberg Philanthropies a charity calculate that G20 countries offered direct subsidies on coal oil gas and fossil-fuel-fired power worth more than $33trn between 2015 and 2019 Tim Gould of the International Energy Agency an official body notes that periods of lower energy prices offer governments a chance to reduce subsidies The fact that they did not use the pandemic-induced drop in energy demand and prices last year to roll back subsidies he says was “a missed opportunity” In July G20 ministers could not even agree on a date by which fossil-fuel subsidies would be phased outA new study from the IMF powerfully sets out both the scale of the subsidies and their impact It estimates the effects of two types of support Explicit subsidies which include production-tax breaks for oil firms create a wedge between the cost of supplying fuel and the price consumers pay at the pump Yet governments are underpricing energy not only relative to supply costs but also compared with social costs such as the damage to health and the environment caused by fossil fuels The researchers call this an implicit subsidyThey estimate that explicit subsidies will amount to just under $600bn this year or 06% of global GDP but that implicit subsidies could be ten times that see chart 1 Even if the value of explicit support remains constant as a share of global output the boffins reckon that the damage from fossil fuels especially coal will worsen and that the value of implicit subsidies will continue to rise see chart 2If governments were to eliminate both explicit and implicit subsidies by 2025admittedly a huge ifthen global emissions of carbon dioxide would fall by 36% and global tax revenues would be higher by 38% of world GDP compared with a scenario with no subsidy reform Rather than a miserable world in which warming is 3°C above pre-industrial levels the temperature rise would be kept “well below” 2°C and perhaps even on track towards 15°C as the UN Paris climate accords intend As the world leaders prepare to assemble in Glasgow for a climate summit the hope is that these findings re-energise their efforts to tackle subsidy reform For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub

 Oct 23rd 2021,How soaring energy costs could hobble the covid-19 recovery,FUEL PRICES over the past month show the same vertiginous upward slope as a covid-19 case count during a particularly brutal wave Coal and gas prices have touched all-time highs Asian spot prices for gas have jumped by nearly 1000% in the past year The cost of oil has soared as shortages of other fuels have pushed up demand for crudeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSurging energy costs are in many respects an expression of the same phenomenon driving supply-chain backlogs all over the world An unexpectedly strong rebound in demand has run headlong into stagnant supply Disruptions such as shortfalls in hydroelectric-power production caused by droughts have exacerbated the shortages So has the rush to boost low inventories in response to the energy crunch But surging fuel prices are also more ominous than supply-chain woes Past energy shocks have been associated not only with inflation but deep recessions too as exemplified by the economic travails of the 1970s What does the latest crunch hold in store?The inflationary consequences of costly energy are already apparent In the euro area headline annual inflation jumped to 34% in September thanks to a 174% leap in energy costs Underlying “core” inflation which excludes food and energy prices rose by a more modest 19% In America underlying inflation ran hotter in September at 4% But a 248% increase in energy costs pushed the headline rate up even higher to 54% These figures are likely to rise further in coming months since rocketing fuel prices in October have not yet made their way into the statisticsThe contribution of energy to inflation will begin to fade once prices plateauas they may in coming months and even sooner if winter proves no colder than usual Recent analysis by economists at Goldman Sachs a bank suggests that the effect of energy costs on America year-on-year inflation rate stood at 215 percentage points in September and will likely rise to 25 percentage points by the end of this yeartaking the headline rate to 58% holding other components constantbefore eventually turning slightly negative by the end of 2022What about the damage to growth? The predominant factor in the near term at least is the effect on consumption and investment Over short time horizons households and firms cannot easily cut energy use in response to rising costs leaving less to spend on other goods and services This effect according to work by Paul Edelstein of State Street a bank and Lutz Kilian of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is concentrated in the consumption of durable goods; a rise of 10% in the price of energy is associated with a 47% decline in spending on durables and a particularly large drop in purchases of vehiclesYet the researchers also note that consumption tends to fall by more in response to rising fuel costs than you might expect given the share of energy in budgets That seems to be because energy shocks tend to depress sentiment James Hamilton of the University of California San Diego studies historical oil shocks and finds that a 20% rise in the real price of energy is associated with a 15-point drop in an index of consumer confidence A gauge of American sentiment collected by the University of Michigan has fallen by nearly 17 points since April 2021An energy-induced slump could be mitigated if consumers meet higher bills by drawing on savings By the end of 2020 households across large rich economies had accumulated “excess” or above-normal savings equivalent to more than 6% of GDP Nonetheless analysts at Goldman reckon that costly energy will reduce the growth rate of consumption in America by 04 percentage points this year and by 05 points in 2022 Those inclined to see the petrol tank as half full may note that slower consumption growth could help ease strains on supply chains which have been stressed by especially strong demand for durable goods Those who grumble that it is half empty may worry that power cuts in places like China could result in still more shortagesCrucially the toll of the shock will depend on how central banks respond Fuel prices tend to feed through to households’ expectations of inflation That will be unwelcome news for central bankers who are already worrying about high inflation Research by Mr Kilian and Xiaoqing Zhou also of the Dallas Fed suggests that energy prices mainly influence short-term expectations rather than those further out Those expectations could adjust just as quickly when energy prices fall Some central banks such as the Bank of England may nevertheless worry that the energy shock worsens the risk that inflation expectations become unmoored from their targets But the dilemma is that if they overreact they depress consumption further and induce deflationary pressure just as energy prices return to earthA pity the fuelsThe longer prices stay high the more their effects evolve Households and firms will become better able to reduce their exposure to energy Indeed work by John Hassler Per Krusell and Conny Olovsson of the Institute for International Economic Studies in Stockholm suggests that costly energy affects the nature of innovation Firms direct inventive efforts so as to economise on scarce inputs When energy is abundant they focus on capital- or labour-saving innovation When energy is scarce by contrast firms do more to improve the energy-efficiency of production and innovation suffersas it did in the 1970sThe extent to which history repeats however also depends on what governments do They could shield customers from higher energy prices which would be politically popular but delay the moment of transition from dirty fuels Or they could encourage more investment in renewable-power capacity so that energy constraints bind less Such bold action could end the threat posed by expensive coal gas and oil once and for all For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterDig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe
 Oct 23rd 2021,Why it matters when trades settle,THE PAEANS that followed the recent retirement of KKR founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts formerly private equity barbarians-in-chief are a reminder that the story of Wall Street is one of big deals bold trades and the people behind them Those further behind them in the “back offices” of banks brokers and buy-out firms barely get a look in Understandably so: their world is colourless compliance and “post-trade” processes like clearing and settlement They are the plumbers of finance toiling behind the scenes to ensure that the pipework well works Every so often however there a gurgling noise loud enough to unsettle even those cocksure colleagues out frontListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe system for settling stock tradesensuring the buyer gets her security and the seller his cashcame under strain during the covid-induced volatility of March 2020 It creaked again early this year amid the meme-trading frenzy in GameStop shares A report by regulators into that episode published on October 18th noted drily that post-trade processes “normally in the background entered the public debate” It was thanks to spiking margin calls and volatility-induced settlement risks that Robinhood a retail broker restricted trading in GameStop stock causing uproarRisk is a function of time The longer between trade execution and completion the bigger the “counterparty” risk or the chance that one side or the other fails to pony upas anyone caught mid-trade when Lehman Brothers or Archegos Capital collapsed can attest And therefore the heftier the margin payments that brokers and investors have to post with clearing-housesHence the long-running push to bring down trade-processing timesfrom 14 days “T+14” in the parlance in the 18th century when certificates were carried on horseback and ship; to under a week following reforms in the wake of the 1968 Wall Street paperwork crunch when a trading boom forced exchanges to close one day a week for months to allow the backroom boys to catch up; to T+5 then T+3 and four years ago T+2Still a lot can happen in two days on Wall Street so why stop there? Spurred by the market gyrations of last year a group representing banks investors and clearers has been studying a move to T+1 and is expected within weeks to unveil a plan for how to get there The signs are that the Securities and Exchange Commission will bless it If so the halving of settlement time could kick in as early as 2023 Europe for one would probably follow suitLest anyone think the titans of finance are going soft it should be pointed out that they are not pushing this solely for the greater good They are as interested in cutting their own costs as systemic risks During last year market turmoil overall margin demanded by the DTCC America clearing agency for stocks jumped five-fold to more than $30bn daily Hundreds of billions more a year are tied up by “fails-to-deliver” delays owing to settlement failures the causes of which range from mistyping errors to more sinister practices such as failing deliberately in order to manipulate the price of a stock Freeing up this capital would leave financial firms with a lot more to invest profitablyWhy then stop at one-day settlement? Evangelists for so-called distributed-ledger technology are touting the possibility of going to T+0 known as “atomic” settlement This looks technically feasible; indeed some broker-to-broker trades at the DTCC are already settled on a near-instantaneous basisBut is it desirable? There is a big difference between reducing settlement time and eliminating it In the latter the buyer would have to be pre-funded and the seller immediately ready to swap Every bit of a complex process would need to be synchronised with no room for error It may also require a wrenching restructuring of the giant securities-lending market which is designed to fit with settlement with a time lagCue cries of “Luddite!” But Buttonwood is in good company in advocating keeping some redundancy in the process Ken Griffin the founder of Citadel Securities one of America largest marketmakers and thus no techno-slouch has described real-time settlement as “a bridge too far” because it requires “everything [to] work perfectly in a world where there still people involved” The message is clear: pushing things too far could replace one set of risks with another scarier one in which a small number of failed trades set off a chain-reaction across back offices worldwide Atomic indeedClarification October 28th 2021: This article has been amended to clarify that Ken Griffin is the founder of Citadel SecuritiesFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Oct 21st 2021,A triple shock slows China growth,IN A SCENE from “Manufactured Landscapes” a documentary released in 2006 Edward Burtynsky a landscape photographer seeks permission to take pictures of the black mountains of Chinese coal awaiting shipment in Tianjin an industrial city near Beijing “Through his camera lens through his eyes it will appear beautiful” Mr Burtynsky assistant assures his sceptical host That turns out to be not quite true Through the photographer lens the piles of coal have a dark satanic geometrynot beautiful exactly but awe-inspiring in their immensityListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLooking at those pictures one of which is shown above it is hard to imagine China could ever run short of this fuel But in recent months the black pyramids have been not quite immense enough A scarcity of coal which accounts for almost two-thirds of China electricity generation has contributed to the worst power cuts in a decade And the blackouts have in turn hurt growth “Our economy is developing very fast” Mr Burtynsky host tells him so as to excuse the gloom and dirt in the air But that is not quite true any more eitherThe Chinese economy has been hit by a triple shock stemming not only from the power cuts but also the pandemic and a property slowdown exacerbated by the financial woes of Evergrande a developer Figures published on October 18th showed that economic growth slowed to 49% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier see chart Industrial production expanded by only 31% year-on-year in September slower than in any month during the global financial crisis More than a year and a half after covid-19 first struck China is reporting growth rates that were unheard of before the pandemicConsider the energy crunch first The causes of the coal shortage fall into two categories: structural and incidental The unlucky contingencies include floods in Henan province in July and in Shanxi this month which forced some mines to close In addition in Inner Mongolia which accounts for about a quarter of China coal output an investigation into corruption has implicated and hamstrung some of the officials who might previously have approved expansions in coal mining Shaanxi province China third-largest producer of coal slowed production to keep the skies clear for a national athletics event in September which President Xi Jinping attended And coal expansion has also been inhibited by safety inspectors who have scrutinised 976 mines after more than 100 industrial accidents nationwide last yearThe deeper reason for the coal crunch is China efforts to reduce its dependence on the fuel which is responsible for a big share of the country carbon emissions The authorities have been reluctant to approve new mines or the expansion of existing ones in recent years because “it clearly driving the bus in the wrong direction” says David Fishman of The Lantau Group an energy consultancyWhen supply is tight prices are supposed to rise obliging customers to economise on their consumption But as the price of coal shot up power stations were unable to pass their higher costs on The amount they could charge the grid company that buys the bulk of their power could rise only up to 10% above a regulated price which was changed infrequently And the tariff paid by end-users was based on a catalogue of prices that was similarly inflexible Some power stations simply stopped operating refusing to generate at a lossAnother shock to the economy came from the pandemic Outbreaks of covid-19 such as a cluster that began in Nanjing in July prompted strict localised lockdowns depressing retail spending especially catering and travel According to Flight Master a travel site airlines were operating at less than half their full capacity in August and at only two-thirds of it in SeptemberThe final shock was to the country property sector a perennial engine of growth employment leverage and anxiety Regulators are trying to curb speculative demand for flats and limit the excessive borrowing of homebuilders That effort to limit financial risk has brought some existing dangers to a head Evergrande huge firm with $300bn in liabilities missed a payment on a dollar bond on September 24th and has been followed by others Some homebuyers are now understandably nervous about handing over their cash to any developer who may not be in business long enough to finish the projects they are sellingAgainst this backdrop China developers started 135% fewer homes this September than they had a year earlier and their sales measured by floorspace fell by a similar percentage China also reported sharp falls in the production of cement down by 13% in September compared with last year and steel which fell by 148%On October 15th China central bank described Evergrande as an idiosyncratic case in a generally healthy industry That should have been reassuring except that policymakers will not come to the property sector rescue until they are sufficiently worried about its plight Anxiety among regulators may be a necessary condition for alleviating the anxiety of homebuilders and their creditorsMost economists think China year-on-year growth will slow even further in the last three months of the year Bank of America has forecast growth of 25% in a base case China will maintain its vigilance against covid-19 and the property downturn has further to run But one of the three whammies should at least pack less of a punch in the remainder of the year Power stations unlike property developers have won belated relief from higher authorities Mines have been ordered to expand production And China principal planning body threatened on October 19th to step in if coal prices remain punishingly high prompting a sharp sell-off of coal futuresThat threat of intervention in upstream pricing followed a big step towards liberalisation further downstream The government will give power stations more freedom to pass on higher costs to the grid company It will also force industrial and commercial customers but not households or farmers to pay power prices negotiated in the market not those set down in a catalogue These reforms have been in the works for a long time But it took an acute crisis to force the issue Policymakers might once have preferred a “measured roll-out of market reforms” notes Mr Fishman But things changed “when the lights started to go out in factories across the country” China likes to cross rivers by feeling for the stones But when a stone gives way it is time to take a leap For more expert analysis of the biggest

 Oct 21st 2021,The race to redefine cross-border finance,IN 1977 A string of 12 characters ushered in a new age of global finance Until then a bank wiring money abroad needed to relay up to ten instructions on public phone lines which were then typed into forms taking time and causing errors Then payments began to be facilitated by a code and secure network created by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications SWIFT a club of 500-odd banks A surge in global trade and investment followed More than $140trn has been transmitted across borders in the past year equivalent to 152% of global GDP Analysts reckon about 90% of that went through SWIFT Its 11000 members in 200 countries ping each other 42m times a dayListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNow SWIFT confronts another financial revolution Customers want faster payments Fintechs banks and governments are vying to rival the network Facebook is muscling in: on October 19th it began a trial of its digital-currency wallet SWIFT for its part is fighting back On October 14th it said 100 banks had signed up to SWIFT Go its high-speed transfer service It is seeking to link instant-payment networks across countries in order to make transfers seamless Whoever wins the race to redefine cross-border payments will determine the future shape of the financial systemand who holds sway over itThe system of correspondent banking through which cross-border payments flow works like air transport: when two faraway banks do not have a direct relationship money travelling from one to the other stops over at banks in between SWIFT provides the radio signal directing the money The Belgium-based network which is owned by its members provides the standards and services that allow firms to exchange information on transactionsIn recent years however SWIFT has faced three criticisms One is that it is technologically backward making transfers slow and costly Here the problem lies with correspondent banking not SWIFT Time differences and banks’ limited opening hours hold back processing Checks have intensified along with the fight against dirty money adding to costs and delaysSecurity is another concern In 2016 North Korean hackers stole the SWIFT credentials for the Central Bank of Bangladesh account at the New York Federal Reserve and sent transfer requests to various banks Most were blocked but $81m slipped through A third gripe is that SWIFT is no longer a neutral part of the financial plumbing In 2011 America leant on it to exclude Iranian banks by making various threats including that of sanctions on the network itself says a former official close to the talks SWIFT eventually complied It also came under pressure to cut off Russian banks after the invasion of Crimea in 2014 Although they remained connected America foes now know that relying on SWIFT makes them vulnerableSWIFT has gone some way towards placating its critics It has bolstered its security defences and its international governance it says reinforces its neutral status In 2017 it launched SWIFT Global Payments Innovation GPI a network that allows banks to process wholesale ie high-value payments more quickly and to track transfers It now accounts for three-quarters of SWIFT payments Today 92% of these reach their destinations in less than 24 hours In July it launched SWIFT Go a similar service for retail low-value paymentsAll this may help neutralise the threat from fintech firms Many do not bypass SWIFT entirely: they aggregate payments at one end and net them off against transactions going the opposite way so as to make just one smaller cross-border transfer and then use fast local networks to channel the money That means fewer payments and less access to transaction data for SWIFT Ripple a more radical disrupter evades the network altogether and uses a cryptocurrency to facilitate transactionsYet fintechs so far play a minuscule role in cross-border payments Data crunched by FXC Intelligence a consultancy for The Economist suggest that the share of cross-border payments by value going through SWIFT has remained broadly unchanged since 2019 The number of messages sent across the network has risen steadily Ripple by contrast has struggled to gain traction Last year it settled just $24bnInstead the bigger threats to SWIFT come from bigger beasts Credit-card giants are building the infrastructure to process retail “push” payments those initiated by the sender rather than the receiver as is usually the case with credit cards that will run largely parallel to SWIFT Both Visa and Mastercard whose networks have over 15000 member banks each have bought startups that facilitate account-to-account transfers Facebook wallet could make cross-border payments cheaperBig banks are developing payment networks to serve wholesale clients Earlier this year JPMorgan Chase which accounts for a quarter of dollar payments going through SWIFT teamed up with DBS a Singaporean bank and Temasek Singapore sovereign-wealth fund to launch Partior This is a network that aims to get around the flaws of correspondent banking by recording transfers on “permissioned” blockchain ledgers where only members can validate transactions The network will allow for instant transparent and “programmable” payments ie the funds move only if certain conditions are metAnother threat is state-sponsored Many central banks are developing their own digital currencies known as CBDCs Over time these could allow banks to conduct overseas transactions across a shared ledger undercutting SWIFT America foes are building new plumbing In 2015 China launched its Cross Border Interbank System CIPS which offers clearing and settlement for renminbi payments The system which processed $7trn in 2020 uses SWIFT as its main messaging channel but has the tools to become a rivalSWIFT has responded by schmoozing with central banks and running experiments of its own in the hope of securing a place at the heart of any cross-border CBDC infrastructure In February it also formed a tie-up with CIPS and China central bank And sheer force of habit could mean international finance continues to be bound by its current nervous system even if the institutional muscle and monetary blood that compose it evolve says Markos Zachariadis the co-author of a book on SWIFTBut it is also possible to imagine a scenario in which banks gravitate towards a new platform Most are not especially loyal to SWIFT: America biggest banks feel they have no voice says an executive at one of them Just two American lenders sit on its board only one of whichCitigroupis a major bank Meanwhile Partior which aims in time to host both central-bank and commercial-bank digital money is in talks to recruit core settlement banks for euro renminbi and yen payments says one of its sponsors China is touting CIPS messaging skills says Eswar Prasad a former official at the IMF SWIFT may not be in immediate danger but the next decade is

 Oct 16th 2021,Another upward force on American inflation: the housing boom,FROM ENERGY and used cars to wages and shipping the list of factors pushing up American inflation is growing fast Could housing be next? According to figures published on October 13th the consumer-price index CPI rose by 54% in the year to September Its shelter component increased by 32% up from 28% in the year to August And it has further to runListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKShelter has the biggest weight in the CPI making up 32% of the basket of goods and services used to construct the index The component is broken into two main buckets: regular rents paid by tenants and the imputed cost of living in owned homes Although house prices rose by 20% in the year to July they do not feed directly into the CPI That is because statisticians treat home purchases as investment rather than consumption Instead they capture homeownership by estimating “owners’ equivalent rent” the amount an owned property could collect based on leased ones nearby The rental market therefore is what drives shelter inflationFor much of the pandemic both rents and shelter inflation were depressed But there are two reasons to think the latest pickup in shelter costs will continue The first is the expiry of the government eviction moratorium The policy had helped renters stay in their homes in 2020 even as lockdowns meant some were unable to work Many tenants also negotiated lower rents during that time Now that the moratorium has lapsed Goldman Sachs a bank expects about 750000 evictions by the end of year That could lead to a jump in rents The largest rises occur when a new tenant moves in says Randal Verbrugge of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Rents for new leases are up by 17% compared with what the previous tenant paid suggests RealPage a rental siteThe second reason why shelter inflation might rise further is that market prices feed through to the inflation figures only slowly Landlords tend to charge more rent when the value of their property goes up but with a lag Rises in new rents also take time to appear in consumer prices because leases tend to last a year and the CPI samples rents only every six months or so President Joe Biden Council of Economic Advisers estimates that a one-percentage-point increase in house-price inflation leads to a rise of 011 percentage points in the shelter component in 16 months’ timeA timely measure of rents published by Zillow a property site is up by around 10% on the year Further rises could follow as more new leases are signed Laura Rosner-Warburton of Macro Policy Perspectives a research firm expects shelter inflation to climb to 4-6% by the end of 2022 That would contribute 13-19 percentage points to headline inflation twice its average contribution in the decade before the pandemic The next inflationary force could be home-grown For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 16th 2021,Chinese companies suffer an intense cash crunch in offshore bond markets,GLOBAL INVESTORS are all too aware of the discount on the valuations of mainland firms as a result of Xi Jinping aim to lower leverage house prices and inequality in China Borrowers for their part must contend with a “Xi premium” on sorely needed capital The Chinese leader policies may have led to a perilous credit crunch for many companies especially property developers in global marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKRegulators have shaken the foundations of China property market by toughening up on the amount of leverage developers can take on This has pushed Evergrande a home builder with more than 1000 projects across China and $300bn in liabilities towards collapse It has missed five payments on offshore-dollar bonds in the past month Several rivals have followed suit Fantasia defaulted on offshore bonds on October 4th Sinic Holdings said on October 11th that it would probably default soon Modern Land and Xinyuan Real Estate are hoping to delay payments on offshore bondsThis wave of distress has led to a crunch in the offshore junk-bond market Spreads ie yields compared with the risk-free rate have reached nearly 17 percentage points the widest gap on record The market has for the most part shut to developers hoping to refinance their debts in October says Sandra Chow of CreditSights a research firm One investment manager at a global institution says even non-property companies are being priced out noting that “this is the definition of contagion”The problems run much deeper than the string of missed payments One fear is that Chinese authorities are pressing companies to ignore the interests of creditors and to sell offshore assets and siphon cash back home in a desperate attempt to ensure that unfinished properties that have already been sold to Chinese people are completed The leading theory among investors goes that Evergrande is buying time to prevent its offshore assets being frozen by offshore creditors A “privately negotiated” resolution on a yuan bond was announced on September 22nd in order to prevent an instant cross-default on dollar bonds Although the group has since missed dollar-bond payments a 30-day grace period gives the group until October 23rd before it is deemed to be in default and creditors can move to seize its offshore assets In the meantime it is selling all it can including a large stake in its property-services unit and its offices in Hong KongOther groups may be considering a similar strategy In recent weeks developers such as Fantasia and Sinic have been reluctant to pay offshore coupons Some instances have surprised investors suggesting that companies may be able but not willing to make these payments says Arthur Lau of PineBridge a Hong Kong-based investment managerIf such behaviour is tolerated or even encouraged by the authorities the impact could be devastating for the $1trn market for dollar bonds issued by Chinese companies More defaults could come if yields stay high Having crushed many private conglomerates that sought to buy overseas assets and impeded Chinese share sales in New York Mr Xi may now be putting his stamp on the offshore-bond market 
 Oct 16th 2021,A new study finds that dirty money remains easy to hide,A  BOOK PUBLISHED in 2014 shook the world of offshore finance “Global Shell Games” exposed the ease with which ne’er-do-wells could launder money or dodge tax using bank accounts held by anonymous shell companies The book NGO activism and numerous leaksthe latest earlier this month being the Pandora Papershave since pushed governments to increase corporate transparency Britain and other countries introduced public registers of company owners America passed a law ending shell-company anonymityListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut to what end? The book authors are putting the finishing touches on a study that suggests little has changed The banks and corporate-service providers CSPsfirms that set up companies for othersmeant to be in the front line of the fight against financial crime do a terrible job of differentiating between legitimate would-be clients and those waving red flagsThe three academics behind the studyJason Sharman of Cambridge University and Daniel Nielson and Michael Findley of the University of Texas at Austinundertook what they call a “mystery shopping expedition” They registered shell companies with varying risk profiles and then sent more than 30000 emails to banks and CSPs in every country of the world to set up bank accounts The riskiest-looking of these brass-plate firms were domiciled in places with a high corruption risk such as Papua New Guinea or Pakistan The safest-looking were from Australia or New Zealand In between were shells from havens of offshore secrecy like the British Virgin Islands In some missives the authors and their team posed as legitimate businessmen; in others as dodgier-sounding supplicants or actual miscreants such as people on sanctions listsThe global anti-money-laundering AML system that has evolved since the 1980s under the Financial Action Task Force FATF a multilateral agency relies heavily on the private sector to weed out dirty money Banks must follow “know your customer” rules and identify a would-be client real or “beneficial” ownerThis “risk-based” regime is broken suggests the study The authors found that the varying risk profiles made “almost no difference” to banks’ willingness to open an account; CSPs were even less sensitive to risk One Singaporean bank however deserves credit for smelling a rat replying “Hey you’re the Global Shell Games guys!”The study shows that the grunt-work of AML is being “pushed onto a private sector which can’t or won’t do it” says Mr Sharman “Banks are unable or unwilling to make the fine-grained risk judgments the system demands because they use standardised generic procedures”Although the conclusion fits broadly with previous research by the authors Mr Sharman says he was surprised by the level of risk-insensitivity because “some of our approaches were ridiculously dodgy” Other experts will also be taken aback: scholars surveyed by the authors before they went shell-shopping predicted that the study would show the system to be working much better than it was before the transparency reforms of the past five yearsThe FATF knows the system is far from perfect Last year its chief David Lewis who has since resigned admitted that national AML laws were rarely being used effectively He also implored bankers to “stop just ticking the boxes” Even before this study the agency was reviewing its approach More than tinkering is in order For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 16th 2021,The IMF decides to keep its boss,IT TOOK 24 days and seven bureaucratic steps to start a business in Beijing according to the World Bank report on the ease of doing business in 2017 But an investigation released last month concluded that the bank leaders including Kristalina Georgieva its former second-in-command had pressed staff into doctoring the report to flatter China The allegations left Ms Georgieva fighting to save her current job as head of the IMF On October 11th the fund board finally decided her fate The evidence it said “did not conclusively demonstrate” that Ms Georgieva “played an improper role” It had taken almost 26 days and eight meetings for the board to finish its business But at the end of it all she could keep her jobListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMs Georgieva a former EU commissioner had won the backing of Britain France Germany and Italy the powers that installed her in the first place The finance ministers of 17 African countries praised her “human touch” as well as the $30bn the IMF mobilised last year to help the continent in its fight against covid-19 Two former chief economists of the bank Lord Nicholas Stern and Joe Stiglitz one of whom has a Nobel prize also expressed strong support Mr Stiglitz described the investigation as a “hatchet job”Arrayed against her in fearful symmetry were two other former chief economists of the bank Anne Krueger and Paul Romer one of whom has a Nobel prize She also had to win over America Treasury led by Janet Yellen It was under pressure from both sides of Congress which are united in alarm about China growing global influence In a call with Ms Georgieva on October 11th Ms Yellen said there was not now “a basis for a change in IMF leadership” but that the investigation raised “legitimate issues” and that the Treasury will “evaluate any new facts or findings” Investigators are still working on a report for the bank human-resources department on potential misconduct by former or current staffMs Georgieva also benefited from the perception that the changes made to the report in 2017 were mere judgment calls But a separate investigation by the bank released in December 2020 established that the tweaks were in fact not judgment calls but errors To take one example: the seven steps and 24 days required to start a business in Beijing had been incorrectly cut from nine and 26 at the last minuteThe manipulation of the data in this report and the one published in 2019 was bad enough that eight World Bank staff members eventually blew the whistle triggering the investigation Both the fund and the bank will have to ensure future whistleblowers feel protected enough to raise the alarm earlier Ms Georgieva will have to prove that she is not a pushover for the fund bigger members and can insulate its technical judgments from politics The fund is supposed to review the voting structure of its board by the end of 2023 It is hard to imagine Ms Georgieva persuading America to back any redistribution of votes to China as the country growing economic weight would warrantIf Ms Georgieva feels ill-treated by the bank she may get the last laugh Even before she took over the fund it was encroaching on the bank turf tackling issues such as inequality climate and gender Its response to the pandemic demonstrated its ability to lend more money faster than the bank possibly can Insiders share a joke loosely inspired by an old French quip about a divided Germany Is Ms Georgieva unhappy with the bank?

 Oct 13th 2021,Wages are surging across the rich world,NOT LONG ago pundits obsessively checked the latest statistics on covid-19 cases Now they are doing the same with the inflation numbers American consumer prices rose by 54% in the year to September according to figures published on October 13th exceeding forecasts A survey from the New York Federal Reserve released the previous day showed a small pickup in consumers’ inflation expectations In its semi-annual report on the global economy the IMF warned that the prospects for inflation were “highly uncertain” Soaring energy costs will push up consumer prices in the near term Pay too is surging as red-hot demand runs up against a shortage of workers Does it stand to fuel further price rises?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen covid-19 first struck most forecasters expected bosses to slash bonuses and yearly rises or even to cut basic pay as they did after the global financial crisis in 2007-09 Although wage growth did slow modestly early in the pandemic that restraint has since been abandoned Oxford Economics a consultancy finds that pay in the rich world is growing at a rate well above its pre-pandemic average The acceleration in compensation per worker across the OECD a club of mostly rich countries is equally arresting see chart 1The wage numbers have sometimes misled during the pandemic When lockdowns were imposed poorly paid people in service jobs dropped out of the workforce for instance which had the effect of raising average pay as measured by statisticians Even so wage growth seems to have been stronger than the scale of the economic downturn alone would have suggested Goldman Sachs a bank has created a “tracker” that corrects for pandemic-related distortions Underlying wage growth at about 25% across the G10 group of large economies is as fast as it was in 2018No wonder then that pay has become a hot topic in the corporate world On October 6th Bank of America increased its company-wide minimum wage by 5% Amazon now boasts of roles in transport and packaging paying $2250 an hour in America making left-wing activists’ demands for a federal minimum wage of $15 seem quaint An index compiled by Goldman suggests that the share prices of American companies most exposed to rising labour costs have fallen by 4% since May even as the broader stockmarket has risen by 7% Even bosses in Germany long used to acquiescent unions now face demands to pay upSome workers are benefiting more than others Analysis by The Economist of British wage data by industry suggests that annual pay growth is twice as dispersed as it was before the pandemic Wages in the accommodation and food-service sector which is struggling to attract workers rose by 8% in the year to July; increases in manufacturing have been more modest In America the wages of the least-paid quartile of workers are growing 70% faster than those at the top see chart 2Underlying pay is rising about three times as quickly in Anglo-Saxon countries as in continental Europe That could be because places such as America and Canada rely more on the consumer-facing industries experiencing the worst labour shortages And France and Italy where annual pay growth is below 1% probably do not face the same immigration crunch as Britain which has Brexited or Australia and New Zealand which have closed their borders to keep out covid-19Only a few years ago economists were bemoaning weak wage growth So it may seem churlish not to pop the champagne now that the opposite is happening But pay can rise for a variety of reasons some more benign than others For a given level of productivity higher wages must show up in one of two ways: as higher inflation or as a higher “labour share” of GDPTake inflation first Costlier staff may force bosses to raise the price of whatever they are selling At worst higher inflation could cancel out any rise in cash wages leaving workers no better off than they were before and perhaps encouraging them to seek further increases American real wages are growing on a monthly basis but they remain lower than a year agoSome firms seem happy to pass on a bigger wage bill to consumers On a recent earnings call an executive at Domino Pizza discussed how the firm might offset wage rises pricier Margheritas might be on the way Most S&P 500 companies are protecting margins “by passing on price increases to consumers” says GoldmanOther firms however may absorb higher wages by accepting lower profits That would change the distribution of the economic pie raising the “labour share” or the proportion of GDP paid to workers as wages Our analysis suggests that the labour share in the G7 has risen by about one percentage point since the pandemic beganequivalent to $400bn or so of extra real income for households each yearWhat does this mean for the wider economy? A big topic of debate among economists is whether the labour share before covid-19 had been declining or not It seems most likely that the share fell in America so a recovery might be welcome But an ever-rising labour share would be a worry: it would crimp companies’ profits and thus the investments that are crucial to improving long-run economic growthThere is another happier possibility If productivity rises then wage growth need not cause sustained inflation nor push up the labour share Instead the economic pie would grow with more for everyoneSome evidence suggests that workers are doing more with less Firms are investing in new technologies to meet new demands especially from online commerce “Hybrid” work may be more efficient than everyone being in the office all the time Productivity statistics are even cloudier than the wage ones; but since the third quarter of 2020 output per employed person has risen in 25 of the 29 rich countries for which figures are availableThe rise in wages then seems to reflect a number of underlying economic forces and need not feed through entirely to inflation But forecasting prices is just as hard as predicting covid-19 case numbers One thing is clear: that if the pay surge endures the consequences will be profound

websites worldwide will have to verify the age and identity of anyone featured in a picture or video as well as the ID of the person uploading it They will need to operate a fast complaints process and must review all content before publication These rules are being imposed not by regulators but by Mastercard a credit-card giantWebsites can choose not to work with Mastercard But as the company handles about 30% of all card payments made outside China to do so would be costly Visa which manages 60% of payments is also taking a firmer line on adult sites The trend goes beyond porn In the shadier corners of the web and in areas where the law is unclear or out of date financial firms are acting as de facto regulatorsSince the turn of the century “payments have become a tool of domestic and international policy” says Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution a think-tank After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 America introduced new anti-money-laundering rules and more targeted sanctions Financial firms must block payments to the people on a list that today runs to 1604 pagesGovernments also began to tap banks for help at home A craze for online poker prompted America Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 which handed responsibility for blocking transactions not to the internet service providers that allowed access to poker sites but to the companies that enabled the payments As most American states legalised the cannabis industry in some form its growth was nipped in the bud by federal laws that dissuade banks from dealing with marijuana mogulsHanding enforcement duties to companies relieves the taxpayer of some of the cost It is not unusual for big banks such as HSBC or JPMorgan Chase to employ more than 20000 specialists in risk and compliance In 2017 Accenture a consultancy reckoned that tech firms employed around 100000 content moderatorsThe effect is also to relieve politicians of making tough decisions “Policymaking involvesachieving societal consensus on difficult issues That has become harder in America” says Mr Klein When banks decline to deal with a customer because of “reputational risk” it sometimes means “a bank regulator [has been] whispering to them ‘We don’t like your being in this business’” says Greg Baer of the Bank Policy Institute an industry body in AmericaActivists have also been applying pressure causing firms to drop unpopular clients In January following outcry over a riot at the US Capitol Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank ended their dealings with Donald Trump then the president whom Signature called on to resign Mr Trump has presumably found other banks willing to work with him But in some industries enough banks have turned up their noses that it can be a problem In August OnlyFans a site known for its adult content said it would no longer allow explicit material owing to pressure from partners including BNY Mellon Metro Bank and JPMorgan none of which commented In the end the ban was reversed after outraged pro-porn activists turned out to be even noisier than the antisVisa and Mastercard near-duopoly makes the firms prime targets for protesters In 2019 SumOfUs a left-wing pressure group tabled a proposal at Mastercard annual meeting meant to stop payments to far-right groups The proposal was defeated Thirty-four women are suing Visa along with the owners of Pornhub an adult site which they say hosted unconsenting footage of them Illegal-porn sites “care a lot more about their finances than they do about the law” says Laila Mickelwait whose Justice Defence Fund helps sex-abuse victims litigate And she adds when financial firms change their policies it applies globally Last year Visa and Mastercard cut off Pornhub over its hosting of potentially unlawful materialPayment companies face a philosophical dilemma “On one hand they try to be very open accepting willing to facilitate payments for whomever They’re not taking any sort of political or moral stance” says Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson a research firm “But on the other hand they also feel like they have a very strong responsibility in making sure that they’re not aiding and abetting any sort of crime”Visa and Mastercard both say that as global companies their guiding principle is local legality But things are not always black and white In 2017 after a far-right march in Charlottesville Virginia Mastercard shut down the use of its cards on websites that had made “specific threats or incite[d] violence” but kept dealing with others labelled hate-groups “Our standard is whether a merchant activity is lawful even when we disagree with what they say or do” the company said at the timeIn grey areas they have reason to err on the side of caution Payment networks’ risk of liability tends to be low since they operate at one remove from the merchants But being named in a sex-trafficking complaint does not look good In working with a borderline adult site for instance there “not a lot of upside and a lot of downside” says Ms Ellis And in legally tricky areas it can be cheaper to issue a blanket ban than pick through every difficult caseIn policy areas where the law has yet to catch up financial firms can end up writing regulations themselves Some cases are innocuous: in 2019 Mastercard introduced rules for companies offering free trials requiring that they alert customers before payments begin But other policies involve real trade-offs between values like free speech and safety Mastercard requirement that adult sites screen content before publication ought to help stamp out illegal material but will probably mean less of the legal sort too The company suggests that it will cut off sites that use artificial intelligence to “nudify” clothed images something which in most countries is not against the law An executive at another firm wonders if such rules ought instead to be made by governments “Where it grey who would you rather make the decisions?” he asksFor as long as legislation lags behind financial institutions will be left in a difficult position: accused either of being the “moral police” as one executive puts it or of enabling wrongdoing As Richard Haythornthwaite then Mastercard chairman told the protesters at the firm annual meeting in 2019: “If it is lawful then we need to respect that transaction If it is something that is swimming

 Oct 12th 2021,The Nobel prize in economics celebrates an empirical revolution,A “CREDIBILITY REVOLUTION” has transformed economics since the 1990s Before that theory ruled the roost and empirical work was a poor second cousin “Hardly anyone takes data analysis seriously” declared Edward Leamer of the University of California Los Angeles in a paper published in 1983 Yet within a decade new and innovative work had altered the course of the profession such that the lion share of notable research today is empirical For enabling this transition David Card of the University of California at Berkeley shares this year economics Nobel prize awarded on October 11th with Joshua Angrist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Guido Imbens of Stanford UniversityListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe messy real world can often defy economists’ attempts to establish causality Working out how a rise in the minimum wage affects employment for example is complicated by the fact that some other influence a chronically weak labour market say may have contributed to changes in both policy and employment In other fields researchers establish causation by designing experiments where subjects are randomly assigned to different groups only one of which receives a particular treatment so that the effect of the treatment can be clearly seen More economists are also using randomised controlled trialsindeed the Nobel prize in 2019 rewarded such efforts But many questions cannot be studied this way for reasons of politics logistics or ethicsThis year prizewinners surmounted such hurdles by using “natural experiments” in which some quirk of history has an effect similar to an intentional trial In a landmark paper published in 1994 Mr Card and Alan Krueger studied the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey by comparing the change in employment there with that in neighbouring Pennsylvania where the wage floor was unchanged Although theory predicted that a minimum-wage rise would be followed by a sharp drop in employment such an effect strikingly did not seem to hold in practice The paper inspired further empirical work and injected new energy into thinking about labour markets Krueger who died in 2019 would probably have shared the prize had he livedThe use of natural experiments quickly spread Mr Card analysed another unique circumstanceFidel Castro decision in 1980 to allow emigration out of Cubato examine the effects of immigration on local labour markets About half the 125000 Cubans who fled to America settled in Miami By comparing the city experience with that in four other places which were similar in many respects but which did not receive an influx of migrants Mr Card found that neither the wages nor the employment of native workers suffered as a result of the migrationMr Angrist together with Krueger used a similar technique to examine the impact of education on labour-market outcomes Because students of a more scholastic disposition are likely both to spend more time in school and to earn more in work what looks like a return to education could in fact reflect natural aptitude In order to determine causality the researchers made use of odd characteristics of America educational system Although laws typically allowed students to drop out of school when they turned 16 all students born in the same year began school on the same date regardless of their birthday Those born in December therefore received more schooling on average than those born in Januaryand the researchers found also tended to earn more Since the month of a student birth may be assumed to be random they concluded that the added education caused the higher earningsThe study of schooling found that an extra year of education raised subsequent wages by 9% Such an effect seemed implausibly large to many economists But that reflected a difference in definition concluded Mr Angrist in work with Mr Imbens The two scholars noted that the effect of a “treatment” was not the same for everyone in a natural experiment If the age at which students could drop out were raised from 16 to 17 for example some would be forced to receive another year of schooling; others who had always intended to stay in school would be unaffectedTogether the researchers developed methods to make the conclusions from natural experiments more useful Economists refer to the quirky factor used in natural experiments like the birth month of a student as an “instrument” Messrs Angrist and Imbens explained the assumptions that need to hold for an instrument use to be valid: it must for instance influence only the outcome being studied earnings in this case through its effect on the treatment years of schooling and not other channels By laying out these assumptions the researchers allowed for more sophisticated analysis: the estimated boost to earnings in Messrs Angrist and Krueger work for instance applies only to students who drop out as soon as they can The benefits to those who choose to study longer cannot be observed Moreover the methodology also improved the transparency of research The reader of a paper can judge for themselves whether an instrument satisfies the needed assumptions and discount the result accordinglyIt only naturalThe credibility revolution like any big upheaval has had its excesses Critics point to careless work and the mining of data in search of results that seem meaningful Scholars are occasionally too eager to extrapolate findings from a particular natural experiment in ways that may not be justified given the uniqueness of the circumstances Yet the innovations developed by this year prizewinners unquestionably changed the field for the better illuminating questions once shrouded in darkness and forcing economists to push theory in directions that better describe real-world experiencea cause indeed for celebration Correction October 12th 2021: A previous version of this article misstated the part of Messrs Angrist and Krueger's study Sorry 
 Oct 9th 2021,A different approach to investing in developing countries,FORTY YEARS ago Antoine van Agtmael of the International Finance Corporation pitched the idea of a “Third World Equity Fund” to sceptical fund managers and the concept of emerging markets entered global investing The aim had been to offer diversified exposure to fast-growing countries outside the rich world Since then emerging and developing countries have in aggregate gained economic and corporate clout But the vast disparities between them makes lumping them all into a single category increasingly odd What might a new framework for investing outside of the rich world look like?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the early 1980s emerging and developing countries made up about 25% of global GDP according to the IMF Today they account for about 40% and more than 20% of total global market capitalisation The market cap of the MSCI emerging-markets index as a share of the global gauge has risen by 13 timesYet countries’ economic situations vary widely Consider for instance the MSCI emerging-markets index In 1988 when the gauge was launched the income per person of countries that were included ranged from $1123 in Thailand to $7598 in Greece In 2019 the range was over four times that stretching from India $2100 to South Korea $31846 The fortunes of some economies such as Brazil and Russia are tied to the vagaries of commodities markets; those of East and South-East Asia by contrast are powered by manufacturingExisting definitions of emerging markets do not capture such complexity Most people including many investors think of the category as linked to income levels But index providers also consider whether trading in markets is as frictionless as in the rich world This is why although South Korea and Taiwan are wealthy their markets are not considered “developed” The result is a grouping that is highly concentrated: the two East Asian countries together make up 27% of the MSCI emerging-markets indexHow then to think about gaining exposure to more than three-quarters of the world population and two-fifths of the global economy? A framework that is organised by geography seems only slightly less arbitrary than the emerging-markets classification: the Turkish and Saudi Arabian markets say have little in common Another approach would be to segment countries by income But this too can have odd results The low-income category for instance would combine places that have failed to develop for decades with those that could soon take off The Republic of Congo and Vietnam have similar levels of income per person but share few other economic qualities Kuwait and Taiwan are broadly as rich as each other but their stockmarkets are vastly different Income levels alone do not say much about a country prospectsPerhaps a more promising approach is to think of countries in terms of their growth models instead This framework would apply to the familiar big emerging economies as well as to the edgier “frontier” markets Investors who want more exposure to export-oriented powerhouses could turn not just to China South Korea and Taiwan but also to later adopters of the model such as Bangladesh and Vietnam These are still minnows compared with the incumbents’ market capitalisation of about $16trn But adding them makes sense since they are already beneficiaries of rising Chinese wages and could expand into technologically advanced manufacturingA second category could include countries that rely instead on services-led growth with all the promise of healthy middle-class consumption Here India and Indonesia are possible candidates; Kenya might be a frontier market worth investigating And a third group could include commodity exporters such as Brazil Russia and South Africa These have provided dismal returns over the past decade and shrunk as a proportion of emerging-market indices But climate change and the green transition could create new winners and losers as some resources such as battery metals become sought-after and others fall out of favourSuch a taxonomy is far from perfect Growth models can change over time for a start Just think of China which is seeking to become more consumption-led Many smaller countries have long had hopes of boosting exports only to be tripped up by poor policymaking Still the strategy of lumping much of the world population and output into one category is no longer useful Time to experimentFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 9th 2021,Does anyone actually understand inflation?,FOR ECONOMICS writinga genre that stylistically is often closer to computer manuals than to literaturea discussion paper recently posted on the Federal Reserve website is a blessed relief Jeremy Rudd a Fed researcher includes quotations from William Butler Yeats and Dashiell Hammett He uses such phrases as “ill-tempered pettifogging” and “arrant nonsense” And as if channelling David Foster Wallace he has fun in his footnotes notably one in which he casually observes that mainstream economics may serve as “an apologetics for a criminally oppressive unsustainable and unjust social order” Little wonder his paper has become by central-bank standards a social-media sensationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut it is the substance not the style of Mr Rudd paper that is most provocative He directs his arguments at an axiomatic idea in economics: that expectations determine inflation The conventional story is straightforward When workers expect prices to rise they demand higher wages When firms expect costs to rise they set higher prices In both cases inflation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy Central bankers’ task is to pin down expectations at a low stable level If they succeed they can control inflationThis idea also appears to have been remarkably successful For the past three decades inflation in the rich world has been quiescent Whenever it has shot above target it has soon enough fallen back Expectations are in the parlance well-anchored Indeed this is why many economists are sanguine about the current bout of inflation: supply disruptions will eventually pass and price pressures will ease It is a comforting thoughtEnter Mr Rudd the author of more than a dozen papers on inflation over the past two decades The idea of inflation expectations “rests on extremely shaky foundations” he writes First he says the theory is flawed Models of inflation mostly include expectations as a short-term variable that is what prices will be in the next month or two Insofar as expectations matter though central bankers and analysts think of them as a longer-term force an underlying trend impervious to cyclical ups and downs Empirically however this is hard to document And whose expectations matter? There are ordinary people businesses forecasters and investors None he argues is much good at predicting pricesNevertheless it is true that the past three decades have seen both subdued inflation and low expectations however measured But Mr Rudd contention is that the causality has been misdrawn It is not that low expectations led to low inflation but rather that low observed inflation led to low expectations As he notes it was only after a recession in the early 1990s when inflation fell sharply and then stayed low that expectations were ratcheted down Mr Rudd concludes that obsessing over inflation expectations is useless and dangerous Useless because it is observed prices that count Dangerous because central bankers might grow unjustifiably confident in their powers of mind controlThe reaction to Mr Rudd provocation has been fierce Tyler Cowen a prolific economist at George Mason University points to the extreme example of hyperinflation as proof that expectations matter When people think their currency will be worth much less tomorrow they switch out of it Ricardo Reis of the London School of Economics who has studied inflation as deeply as Mr Rudd notes that no variableneither expectations nor money supply unemployment or interest ratesis perfect in predicting inflation Yet each contributes to the picture Moreover he adds there is plenty of evidence about expectations Studies show for example that firms that think costs will rise tend to set higher pricesFor all the heat in the debate there may be some common ground Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank makes a sensible distinction Over the long term inflation expectations and specifically whether people believe the central bank will quell soaring prices are important Mr Rudd implicitly concedes this writing that it is best for inflation to “be off of people radar screens” Put differently it is good to expect that inflation is and will be a non-issueYet “that is different from saying that fine differences in inflation expectations are either well-measured or policy-relevant over shorter time horizons” says Mr Posen There is little evidence that communication alone by central banks can control inflation without policy measures And their credibility stems more from responses to crises than from attempts to manage expectationsJanet Yellen drew a similar distinction when she was chair of the Fed Stable long-term inflation expectations appear to be linked to stable long-term inflation she said in a speech in 2015 in line with conventional wisdom But she then pronounced herself “somewhat sceptical” that central banks can influence expectations simply by announcing an inflation target Instead she said expectations may only take hold after a central bank keeps inflation near its target a process that could take yearsInspect the unexpectedSome commentators have concluded from Mr Rudd paper that economics is a mess and no one understands inflation Yet sifting through the arguments there are shared ideas of profound importance First central-bank credibility is precious Second expectations of inflation are formed by experiences of inflation And third in the long run such expectations probably matterWhat does that mean for the rising inflationary pressures now facing much of the world? The hawkish view is that central banks must rein in prices before it is too late and expectations lose their anchor Yet there is also a doveish take Central banks in the rich world remain credible By letting inflation run a little higher now they may help reset expectations After all before covid-19 the big worry in rich countries was too-low inflation Or at least that was what some economists and investors had expected of the futurewhatever their expectations are worth For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 9th 2021,Could a $1trn coin end America debt-ceiling showdown?,“IT IS A mining rock of such resistance that it is not easy to cut with the force of blows on a steel anvil” So wrote Antonio de Ulloa a Spanish traveller to America about platinum in 1748 Such an image may resonate with those frustrated by regular showdowns over America debt ceiling Janet Yellen the treasury secretary has said the country risks running out of money by October 18th if the federal-debt limit is not raised something that the Republicans had been unwilling to countenance doing On October 6th as The Economist was going to press Mitch McConnell the Republicans’ leader in the Senate offered to stop obstructing a small rise in the debt ceiling which would put off the issue until December see United States section But a deal is yet to be doneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPlatinum is at the centre of a more unorthodox campaign to avert a debt crisis In 1996 Congress directed the United States Mint to begin a commemorative coin programme This included minting gold $5 coins depicting George Washington and silver $1 coins to mark the 125th anniversary of the creation of Yellowstone National Park But in 2010 Carlos Mucha a lawyer argued that he had found a loophole in the legislation Whereas the Mint may not produce gold and silver coins in denominations of more than $50 no such limit applies to platinum coins In 2011 a campaign began to encourage the Treasury Department to mint a “$1trn coin” as a way to sidestep a row over the debt ceiling The campaigners argued that the coin would be “money” rather than “debt” and that the Treasury could hand it over to the Federal Reserve in return for the right to draw down funds in order to keep paying the bills while politicians haggled over the debt limitSocial media have made the idea something of a meme this time round The proposal has been promoted enthusiastically by a small core of supporters on Twitter using the hashtag #Mintthecoin Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman has lent his support to the campaign despite conceding its “gimmickry”; two Democrats in the House of Representatives Jerry Nadler and Rashida Tlaib are in favour There is nothing to suggest that Ms Yellen or others in President Joe Biden administration back the idea Barack Obama who ruled it out during the debt-ceiling crisis in 2013 has alluded to it as “wacky” But Senate Republicans were sufficiently worried to have tried to introduce legislation to close the loophole in February this yearIf the coin were minted it would not have to contain $1trn-worth of platinum bullion currently around 30000 tonnes But the legal and constitutional obstacles to the scheme would be significant Neil Buchanan of Levin College of Law argues that the coin would still be subject to the debt ceiling and believes that any attempt to mint it would face court challenges The coin could also undermine the established norm of Fed independence George Selgin of the Cato Institute a think-tank points out that by dumping a huge non-interest-bearing coin on the Fed the net effect of the plan would be to reduce the central bank net interest income and potentially to create a situation in which the Fed is more financially dependent on CongressYet past political brinkmanship has led to higher interest payments and in 2011 a sovereign downgrade A default could have much graver consequences because of the key role Treasuries play in the global financial system This is why some observers think that for all its flaws the coin proposal is worth keeping on the tableMr Buchanan argues that even if the scheme is illegal it might be worth risking court challenges and adopting it if the government needs to buy time That he says is the risk the Biden administration took when it recently extended a moratorium on rental evictions first introduced last year Whether the government would ever take such an unusual step as minting the coin though is far from clear But one of the lessons of the past few years in Washington may be that ideas that once seemed unconstitutional or downright bizarre can go on to become reality For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 9th 2021,A wave of green government bonds is flooding markets,A WAVE OF green sovereign debt is flooding markets Britain issued its first such bond in September alongside other new issuers such as Colombia and Spain They join at least 20 countries that already issue green debt notably Germany which is well on its way to building a “green curve” of bonds across several maturities Governments have together raised more than $100bn through the green route so far this year And later this month the European Union is due to join the club Its €250bn $290bn green-borrowing programme stands to make it the world largest sovereign issuer of the instrumentsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe main difference between a green bond and the regular sort is that the capital raised by it must be spent on certain environment-friendly projects So why not raise debt the old-fashioned way instead and simply direct the proceeds towards greenery? One advantage could be the opportunity to borrow at a lower cost Investors may be willing to accept a lower yield for green bonds that is to pay a higher price for them because they can either count their holdings towards their environmental social and governance targets or because it makes them look good in the public eye says Dion Bongaerts of Erasmus University in RotterdamIndeed investors do demand a higher yield on conventional debts than they do on green ones with near-identical characteristics The yield difference called the “greenium” may seem modest: for a ten-year bond in Germany it is about 005 percentage points But that starts to look more significant when you consider that the yield on a conventional German ten-year bond is -018% The yield gap has risen from 002 points a year ago suggesting that the demand for green debts exceeds their supply Britain bond issued last month had a yield gap of 0025 percentage points more than had been expected for an opening green issuance The sale was oversubscribed by ten timeslarger than any issuance by the Debt Management OfficeStill the cost savings are unlikely to be meaningful for governments says Antoine Bouvet of ING a Dutch bank For €1bn of debt an interest rate that is 005 percentage points lower would mean savings of about €500000 a year a drop in the bucket for a governmentThat suggests that green bonds carry another benefit: they serve as a commitment device for politicians The proceeds of Britain issuance for instance will be spent on a range of green policies including a plan to develop low-carbon hydrogen technologies by 2030 The risk with such commitments is that they end up being either watered down or reversed when a new government comes into power But when a finance ministry creates a green-bond programme and builds out a “green curve” backing out of specific policies may become harder says Mr Bouvet Doing so would hurt liquidity and anger investorsIssuing newfangled bonds could carry other liquidity problems though One is that investors may be unwilling to plough cash into a still-nascent market But as green bonds become more popular the risk for governments is that they split the overall sovereign-bond market in two says Mr Bongaerts Normally all bonds issued at the same time and of a given maturity are identical which makes them easier to trade But a more verdant green segment could have the effect of lowering the liquidity premium that investors place on conventional bonds and increasing the cost of raising fundsGermany has tried to guard against this Last year it began issuing green bonds that are matched to a conventional “twin” with the same maturity date and coupon The Bundesbank maintains liquidity in the market through “switch trades” allowing investors to swap green bonds for conventional ones As more governments go green other workarounds may follow For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Oct 7th 2021,Is the world economy going back to the 1970s?,IT IS NEARLY half a century since the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries imposed an oil embargo on America turning a modest inflation problem into a protracted bout of soaring prices and economic misery But the stagflation of the 1970s is back on economists’ minds today as they confront strengthening inflation and disappointing economic activity The voices warning of unsettling echoes with the past are influential ones including Larry Summers and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and Mohamed El-Erian of Cambridge University and previously of PIMCO a bond-fund managerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKStagflation is a particularly thorny problem because it combines two illshigh inflation and weak growththat do not normally go together So far this year economic growth across much of the world has been robust and unemployment rates though generally still above pre-pandemic levels have fallen But the recovery seems to be losing momentum fuelling fears of stagnation Covid-19 has led to factory closures in parts of South-East Asia hitting industrial production Consumer sentiment in America is sputtering Meanwhile after a decade of sluggishness price pressures are intensifying see chart 1 Inflation has risen above central-bank targets across most of the world and exceeds 3% in Britain and the euro area and 5% in AmericaThe economic picture is not as bad as the situation during the 1970s see chart 2 But what worries stagflationists is less the precise figures than the fact that an array of forces threatens to keep inflation high even as growth slowsand that these look eerily similar to the factors behind the stagflation of the 1970sOne parallel is that the world economy is once again weathering energy- and food-price shocks Global food prices have risen by roughly a third over the past year Gas and coal prices are close to record levels in Asia and Europe Stocks of both fuels are disconcertingly low in big economies such as China and India; power cuts already a problem in China may spread Rising energy costs will exert more upward pressure on inflation and further darken the economic mood worldwideOther costs are rising too: shipping rates have soared because of a shift in consumer spending towards goods and covid-related backlogs at ports Workers are enjoying greater bargaining power this year as firms facing surging demand struggle to attract sufficient labour Unions in Germany for instance are demanding higher pay; some workers are going on strikeStagflationists see another similarity with the past in the current policy environment They fret that macroeconomic thinking has regressed creating an opening for sustained inflation In the 1960s and 1970s governments and central banks tolerated rising inflation as they prioritised low unemployment over stable prices But the bruising experience of stagflation helped shift thinking producing a generation of central bankers determined to keep inflation in check Then after the global financial crisis and a period of deficient demand this single-minded focus gave way to greater concern about unemployment Low interest rates weakened fiscal discipline and enabled vast amounts of stimulus during 2020 Now as in the 1970s the worriers warn governments and central banks may be tempted to solve supply-side problems by running the economy even hotter yielding high inflation and disappointing growthThese parallels aside however the 1970s provide little guidance to those seeking to understand current troubles To see this consider the areas where the historical comparison does not hold Energy and food-price shocks typically worry economists because they could become baked into wage bargains and inflation expectations causing spiralling price rises Yet the institutions that could underpin a new long-lived era of labour strength remain weak for the most part In 1970 about 38% of workers across the OECD a club of mostly rich countries were covered by union wage bargains By 2019 that figure had declined to 16% the lowest on recordCost-of-living adjustments COLA which automatically translate increases in inflation into higher pay were a common feature of wage contracts in the 1970s But the practice has declined dramatically since In 1976 more than 60% of American union workers were covered by collective-bargaining contracts with COLA provisions; by 1995 the share was down to 22% A paper published in 2020 by Anna Stansbury of Harvard and Mr Summers argued that a secular decline in bargaining power is the “major structural change” explaining key features of recent macroeconomic performance including low inflation notwithstanding the decline in unemployment rates over time As dramatic as the pandemic has been it seems unlikely that such a big shift has reversed so quicklyMoreover stagflation in the 1970s was exacerbated by a sharp decline in productivity growth across rich economies In the decades after the second world war governments’ commitment to maintaining demand was accommodated by rocketing growth in productive capacity the French called the period “les Trente Glorieuses” But by the early 1970s the long productivity boom had run out of steam The habit of stoking demand failed to help expand productive potential and pushed up prices instead What followed was a long period of disappointing productivity growthSince the worst of the pandemic however productivity has strengthened: output per hour worked in America grew at about 2% in the year to June roughly double the average rate of the 2010s Booming capital spending could mean such gains are sustainedAnother important break with the 1970s is that central banks have neither forgotten how to rein in inflation nor lost their commitment to price stability In the 1970s even some central bankers doubted their power to curb wage and price increases Arthur Burns then the chairman of the Federal Reserve reckoned that “monetary policy could do very little to arrest an inflation that rested so heavily on wage-cost pressures” Research by Christina and David Romer of the University of California at Berkeley suggests that Mr Burns view was a common one at the time But the end of the era of high inflation demonstrated that central banks could rein in such price rises and this knowledge has not been lost Last month Jerome Powell the Fed current chairman declared that if “sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern we would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our longer-run goal of 2%”The new fiscal orthodoxy likewise has its limits Budget deficits around the world are forecast to shrink dramatically from this year to next In America moderate Democrats’ worries about excessive spending may mean that President Joe Biden grand investment plans are pared downor fail to pass at allWhat next for the world economy then if it does not face a 1970s re-run? Rocketing energy costs pose a serious risk to the recovery Soaring pricesor shortages if governments try to limit riseswill dent households’ and companies’ budgets and hit spending and production That will come just as governments withdraw stimulus and central banks countenance tighter policy A demand slowdown could relieve pressure on supply-constrained sectors: once they have paid their eye-watering electricity bills Americans will be less able to afford scarce cars and computers But it would add a painful coda to nearly two years of covid-19Another important respect in which the global economy has changed since the 1970s is in its far greater integration through financial markets and supply chains; trade as a share of global GDP for instance has more than doubled since 1970 The uneven recovery from the pandemic has placed intense stress on some of the ties binding economies together Panicking governments could hoard resources causing further disruptionPast experience therefore is not the clearest lens through which to view the forces buffeting the global economy The world has changed dramatically since the 1970s and globalisation has created a vast network of interdependencies The system now faces a new unique test For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterAn early version of this article was published online on October 5th 2021
 Oct 4th 2021,The age of fossil-fuel abundance is dead,FOR MUCH of the past half-decade the operative word in the energy sector was “abundance” An industry that had long sought to ration the production of fossil fuels to keep prices high suddenly found itself swamped with oversupply as America shale boom lowered the price of oil around the world and clean-energy sources such as wind and solar competed with other fuels used for power generation such as coal and natural gasListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn recent weeks however it is a shortage of energy rather than an abundance of it that has caught the world attention On the surface its manifestations are mostly unconnected Britain miffed motorists are suffering from a shortage of lorry drivers to deliver petrol Power cuts in parts of China partly stem from the country attempts to curb emissions Dwindling coal stocks at power stations in India are linked to a surge in the price of imports of the commodityYet an underlying factor is expected to worsen the scarcity in the next few years: a slump in investment in oil wells natural-gas hubs and coal mines This is partly a hangover from the period of abundance with years of overinvestment giving rise to more capital discipline It is also the result of growing pressures to decarbonise This year the investment shortfall is one of the main reasons prices of all three energy commodities have soared European gas prices though volatile were near record highs as The Economist went to press Oil crossed $81 a barrel after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and producers such as Russia who are part of the OPEC+ alliance resisted calls to raise output at a meeting on October 4thThe potentially inflationary upheaval will not be good for a world that still gets most of its energy from fossil fuels But it may at least accelerate the shift to greenerand cheapersources of energyStart with oil an industry that needs constant reinvestment just to stand still A rule of thumb is that oil companies are supposed to allocate about four-fifths of their capital expenditure each year just to stopping their level of reserves from being depleted Yet annual investment by the industry has fallen from $750bn in 2014 when oil prices were above $100 a barrel to an estimated $350bn this year reckons Saad Rahim of Trafigura a commodity trader Analysts at Goldman Sachs a bank say that over the same period the number of years’ worth of current production held in reserves in some of the world biggest projects has fallen from 50 to about 25 A supply crunch was averted last year because the covid-19 pandemic clobbered oil demand But once the world economy started to recover it was only a matter of time before a squeeze started to emergeThe industry would usually respond to robust demand and higher prices by investing to drill more oil But that is harder in an era of decarbonisation For a start big private-sector oil companies such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are being pressed by investors to treat oil and gas investments like week-old fish That is either because their shareholders reckon that demand for oil will eventually peak making long-term projects uneconomic or because they prefer to hold stakes in companies that support the transition to clean energy Even though prices are rising investment in oil shows no sign of picking up The Economist has looked at capital-spending forecasts for American and European commodity producers in 2021 and 2022 compared with 2019 Whereas mining firms predict big increases in capital expenditure energy investment is expected to fall sharply Oil firms are instead giving excess cash back to shareholdersAnother factor inhibiting oil investment is the behaviour of OPEC+ countries The half-decade of relatively low prices during the “age of abundance” which reached its nadir with a price collapse at the start of the pandemic gutted state coffers That cut funding for investment As prices recover governments’ priority is not to expand oil-production capacity but to shore up national budgets Moreover state-run producers are cautious worried that a new flare-up of covid-19 cases could hit demand again And as Oswald Clint of Bernstein an investment firm puts it many are wondering “Why not just ride this high price for a while?” In any case even if the rally were eventually to inspire investment it would take several years to meaningfully raise productionLower investment in oil has a spillover effect on the output of natural gas which is often a by-product of drilling for crude Added to that is a dearth of liquefied natural gas LNG terminals for shipping gas from places where it remains relatively easy to access America to those where it is scarcer Asia and Europe Given the long time it takes to build facilities the lack of spare terminal capacity in America is expected to last at least until 2025Investment in thermal coal is weakest of all Even in China and India which are planning new coal-fired power plants the mood has swung against the dirtiest fossil fuel because of both its carbon emissions and its effect on air quality Yet with demand likely to be pushed up as China potentially heads into a cold winter and with India struggling with supplies coal may be in the throes of its last hurrahAll this places fossil-fuel producers in something of a bind A slump in investment could enable some oil gas and coal investors to make out like bandits But the longer prices stay high the more likely it becomes that the transition to clean energy ultimately buries the

 Oct 2nd 2021,Two Fed presidents resign after criticism of their investment activities,ROBERT KAPLAN had a busy 2020 As a voting member of the Federal Reserve monetary-policy committee he participated in its decisions to ramp up stimulus As head of the Dallas Fed he made two dozen public appearances speaking at chambers of commerce think-tanks and conferences And as a wealthy individual he traded millions of dollars’ worth of stocks in companies from Apple to ChevronListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn September 27th amid growing questions about the propriety of such activity for a Fed official Mr Kaplan announced his resignation The focus on his trading revealed in his annual financial disclosure risked becoming a distraction for the central bank he saidHe was not alone Eric Rosengren president of the Boston Fed resigned on the same day under the same cloud His trading was less hefty than Mr Kaplan with most of his orders valued at less than $50000 But he had invested in trusts that held mortgage-backed securities at around the same time that the Fed was buying such assets Mr Rosengren said he was stepping down for health reasonsAt a press conference on September 22nd Jerome Powell the Fed chairman had voiced his displeasure but stopped short of censuring his two colleagues Their investments had been judged by ethics officers to be consistent with the Fed rules They did not for example buy stocks in banks supervised by the central bank And they did not trade within a ten-day window before rate-setting meetingsIt was also hardly the first time that Fed officials many with backgrounds in finance have disclosed big investments Critics have never much liked that But the Fed outsized role in markets in response to the covid-19 pandemic has forced the issue At best active trading looks unbecoming for central bankers tasked with safeguarding the economy At worst there are questions about whether Fed officials might benefit from private information or whether their personal portfolios might influence their policy thinkingOther central banks might face similar quandaries The Bank of Canada for instance permits employees to invest in a wide range of assets restricting just higher-level staff from holding shares in financial firms The Bank of England is similarly relaxed though it does require its staff to obtain approval before trading securities The Fed arguably is already more accountable: the trading activities of Messrs Kaplan and Rosengren were self-reported in their annual disclosures available to journalists by emailMr Powell has vowed that the Fed will tighten its ethics rules after a thorough review Yet it is hard to see how to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest with just about any investing As Mr Powell said he had owned municipal bonds for years partly because they were deemed a safe asset for Fed officials with the central bank unlikely to buy them But last year he helped guide the Fed to rescue the muni market when it came under stress Blind trusts invested across a wide range of index funds and asset classes might be the best solution Any self-respecting central banker should also know that such passive strategies are on average likely to outperform active portfolio management For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Oct 2nd 2021,Can lending controls solve the problem of unaffordable housing?,HOUSE PRICES in the rich world are growing at their fastest rate for 30 years Those in America rose by a record 197% in the year to July according to figures published on September 28th House prices measured relative to incomes are above their long run averages in three-quarters of OECD countries Policymakers nearly everywhere are under increasing pressure to make housing more affordableListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHigher interest rates would bring down house prices relative to incomes by making mortgages more expensive to service and tempering housing demand But raising interest rates to cool the property market now runs the risk of jeopardising the economic recovery from lockdowns More promising in some people eyes could be to tighten the “macroprudential” tools available to central banks and financial regulators which seek to limit risky mortgage lendingOn September 23rd the Reserve Bank of New Zealand tightened macroprudential housing policy for the third time this year saying that past tightening had not done enough to tackle unsustainable house prices Regulators in several other countries including France have also become stricter this year Although these tools were designed to make lenders and borrowers more resilient by restraining the growth of debt the case for using them to control house prices directly is weakMacroprudential policies have a long history and encompass a wide range of levers such as capital and reserve requirements and direct controls over lending rates and quantities Policies aimed at the housing market can include restricting the amount of lending that banks can do at high loan-to-value LTV or loan-to-income ratios LTV tools are the most common: in Europe more than 20 countries deploy them and their use has increased significantly since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 see chartThese controls by having limited credit growth may well have been one reason why last year covid-induced recession did not trigger a financial crisis Because household-borrowing growth and house-price growth often feed off one another it could be tempting to tighten lending controls in order to improve affordability But there are three reasons why that policy would be a mistakeThe first is that research suggests that the effects on house prices do not seem to be large enough to make much difference to affordability One intriguing example is a recent paper by Steven Laufer of the Brookdale Institute and Nitzan Tzur-Ilan then of Northwestern University which studies an LTV policy introduced in Israel in 2010 Faced with rampant house-price inflation the central bank told lenders to hold additional capital against loans with LTV ratios of more than 60% but only for lending of more than 800000 shekels around $220000 This allowed the authors to compare the price growth of the houses subject to the measure with that in the rest of the market The measures were found to reduce aggregate Israeli house prices by no more than 06%Moreover lending controls typically make mortgages more expensive for affected borrowers by rationing credit So even if prices end up slightly lower houses may not be more affordable A study of European countries for instance shows that average mortgage rates rise when LTV policies are tightenedThe third reason why macroprudential policies are not suited to improving affordability is that LTV controls may affect disadvantaged households disproportionately The Israeli study found that the biggest negative effects on house prices were in the less desirable parts of more expensive cities which they suspect occurs because credit-constrained households tend to buy in those areas A previous paper by Ms Tzur-Ilan concluded that affected borrowers in the residential areas around Tel Aviv had to move on average 4-7km farther from their place of work following LTV-policy tightening and faced up to an hour a day of extra commuting time These side-effects may be justified if the ultimate goal is a more resilient financial system But if the policies were intended to reduce house prices to help poorer households they could prove counterproductive entrenching existing inequalitiesOver the past decade macroprudential policies including housing tools have played a big role in reducing borrowing growth in some countries making the financial system safer But the tools were never designed to improve housing affordability and are ill-suited to that job People frustrated by eye-watering rises in house prices might do better to press governments rather than financial regulators to solve the problem For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Oct 2nd 2021,Just how Dickensian is China?,WITH ITS fast trains super-apps digital payments and techno-surveillance China can seem like a vision of the future But for some scholars such as Yuen Yuen Ang of the University of Michigan it is also reminiscent of the past Its buccaneering accumulation of wealth and elaborate choreography of corruption recall America Gilded Age at the end of the 19th century an era that takes its name from a novel by Mark Twain and Charles WarnerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina including Hong Kong and Macau now has 698 billionaires according to Forbes almost as many as America 724 The habits of the new rich could fill a novel in the spirit of Twain Even the non-fiction accounts are outlandish One billionaire according to the book “Red Roulette” by Desmond Shum offered the author well-connected wife a $1m ring as a gift When she refused he bought two anyway One businessman remarked to Ms Ang that his neighbour dog will only drink Evian Meanwhile over 28% of China 286m migrant workers lack a toilet of their own And in parts of rural China 16-27% of pupils suffer from anaemia according to a 2016 study because they lack vitamins and ironNone of this makes Xi Jinping China ruler happy According to a leaked account by a professor who grew up with him he is “repulsed by the all-encompassing commercialisation of Chinese society with its attendant nouveau riche” Mr Xi has begun to talk more frequently about “common prosperity” In January he declared that “we cannot allow the gap between the rich and the poor to continue growing…We cannot permit the wealth gap to become an unbridgeable gulf”Measuring China gaps and gulfs is tricky The most common gauge of income inequality is the Gini coefficient which has become popular despite being hard to interpret One way to make sense of it is with a thought experiment Suppose two people in a country are to meet at random What will be the expected income gap between the two? If you know the income of everyone in the country you can guess by calculating the average gap from every possible pairing That expected gap can be expressed as a percentage of the society average income Cut that percentage in half to get to a number between 0 and 100 and you have the Gini coefficient China official Gini is 465% meaning that the expected gap will be 93% ie twice the Gini of China average disposable income Since average disposable income was 30733 yuan $4449 in 2019 the expected gap would be about $4138China official Gini is higher than that of many advanced countries including America and Britain An alternative calculated by the World Bank looks better 385% in 2016 because it takes account of cheaper prices in rural areas Another source the World Inequality Database overseen by Thomas Piketty and his colleagues reports higher figures because they look at pre-tax income and because they take extra pains to ferret out the unreported income of the rich But as Martin Ravallion of Georgetown University points out the poor may also have unreported resources which may be large relative to their paltry reported incomesAlthough the level of inequality differs between these measures they all agree on one striking point Inequality in China today is not as bad as it was about a decade ago Indeed some scholars have remarked on the “great Chinese inequality turnaround”Why then has concern about inequality turned up even as inequality itself has turned around? Twain may offer one answer One of the protagonists of “The Gilded Age” comforts himself with the thought that although he and his wife have to “eat crusts in toil and poverty” his children will “live like the princes of the Earth” Similarly many Chinese may tolerate life on the lower rungs of society if they think they or their children can climb up the ladderBut that kind of social mobility seems to be slowing Yi Fan and Junjian Yi of the National University of Singapore and Junsen Zhang of Zhejiang University have tried to calculate the persistence of income from one generation to the next Chinese born in the 1970s inherited about 39% of any economic advantage enjoyed by their parents Those born in the 1980s inherited over 44% That is if you knew one set of parents was 1% richer than an otherwise similar set of parents you would expect their children to earn 044% more in their own careers than the other parents’ kidsInequality may also be more conspicuous than it was As Mr Ravallion and Shaohua Chen of Xiamen University have pointed out the decline in Chinese inequality since 2008 does not reflect softer divisions within cities It results instead from a narrower gap between urban and rural China People tend to be more conscious of social fault-lines within a city than they are of disparities between one far-flung place and anotherThe guilted ageMr Ravallion suggests another reason why China great inequality turnaround has gone unnoticed: people do not think in Ginis or percentages but in yuan and fen dollars and cents The expected income gap between two random Chinese may have declined from 98% of average income at inequality peak in 2008 to 93% now But because average income has risen in that time the expected gap in yuan terms is still far larger The income per person of the top fifth of households was 107 times that of the bottom fifth in 2014 That ratio has since fallen a bit But the gap in yuan has increased from 46221 yuan in 2014 to 69021 yuan in 2019The professor who grew up with Mr Xi speculated that if he became leader Mr Xi would “aggressively” tackle China gilded decadence even “at the expense of the new monied class” Mr Xi has already browbeaten some billionaires into public acts of philanthropy The gestures will do little to shift the Gini coefficient But they will make redistribution more conspicuous Deng Xiaoping one of Mr Xi predecessors famously said that he did not care if cats were white or black as long as they caught mice Mr Xi main opinion about cats is that he does not like them fat For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 30th 2021,China new political risk premium,FOR THE average investor China is the source of all sorts of uncertainty A regulatory crackdown on social-media and education firms has sent stocks tumbling Companies with exposure to property are suffering as a result of a clampdown on leverage and a liquidity crisis at Evergrande a developer A ban on cryptocurrency transactions briefly knocked the price of bitcoin And a rush by provincial authorities to meet carbon-emissions targets is causing power shortages which could weigh on both the economy and asset pricesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf investors expect policy to remain volatile then they could start to demand a greater premium for holding Chinese assets “The intensity of policy change has caught investors off-guard” says Chetan Ahya of Morgan Stanley a bank “It not clear what the end game is for each sector so there a lot of uncertainty and it this uncertainty that adds to the risk” Indeed a risk premium may already be becoming apparent for some assetsOver the past six months the MSCI China index of stocks listed on the mainland and in Hong Kong has underperformed global equities by the most in over 20 years Yields on offshore Chinese high-yield dollar bonds at around 145% are higher than they were during the covid-induced market panic of March 2020Analysis by The Economist suggests that stocks in sectors that have been most affected by crackdowns such as information technology and property have lagged behind those of similar firms in America and Europe see chart Goldman Sachs a bank has examined what a change in the policy treatment of “socially important” sectors such as media and entertainment might entail for private firms Although privately owned companies have always had higher returns on equity than state-owned enterprises SOEs recent policy changes will curtail their profits The range of potential outcomes is huge depending in part on how much of the private sector will see SOE-like returns In the most optimistic case the MSCI China index may already be undervalued by a double-digit percentage In a more pessimistic scenario it could still be overvalued by a similar amountWorking out which case is more likely is a question more of politics than finance The policies of any government have a bearing on investment outcomes and are tracked by asset managers around the world But monitoring and predicting the machinations of the Chinese Communist Party is no simple task for experts let alone the average Western financier “For an offshore bond investor why play this game?” asks Alex Turnbull of Keshik Capital a Singapore-based investment fundSure enough investors in offshore assets have cooled towards China One way to gauge this is to compare the stock prices of Chinese companies that are listed both on the mainland and in Hong Kong Equities are typically more expensive at home as China capital controls leave punters with few alternatives But the gap has widened substantially with onshore investors paying a premium of around 45% That is roughly as wide as in 2015 when domestic stocks enjoyed a frenetic rally driven by margin debt This time mainland stocks have been roughly flat The wedge reflects the pessimism of foreign investors rather than the optimism of mainland puntersNot all assets have a higher risk premium attached to them Interbank-lending markets have been quiet so far perhaps aided by support from the People Bank of China Safe state-run companies at the heart of the financial system have shown no signs of turmoil On September 17th the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China a state-owned lender and by some estimates Evergrande largest bank creditor issued $62bn in contingent convertible bonds with the lowest coupon for such a sale for a Chinese company on record The sovereign-bond and foreign-exchange markets have been calm suggesting that investors do not think that current woes will shake China capital controlsWhat does a reduction in foreign investment mean for China? For now the economic effect is limited Although overseas ownership of government bonds has risen in recent years corporate borrowing is still very much a domestic affair Foreign institutions own just 15% of the roughly 76trn yuan $12trn in medium-term notes in the corporate-bond market Some economists argue that China ageing population will mean that it will run current-account deficits instead of surpluses which would need to be funded with more foreign capital But those expectations have yet to be realised The current-account surplus declined to a 25-year low of 02% of GDP in 2018 but picked up again in 2019 and 2020A broad risk premium though the result of various government initiatives would however defeat another policy aim In recent years regulators have tried to encourage investors to be more discriminating about risk They have allowed more company-bond defaults in order to dispel the idea that the state will always bail out troubled firms Those efforts had some clear successes The spread between the yields of AAA- and AA-rated onshore corporate bonds has risen from 17 percentage points two years ago to 23 points today Investors paid more attention to the credit fundamentals of Chinese companiesNow those efforts are being undone Investors are instead guessing where government policy might go next and a blanket risk premium is in place particularly on assets most accessible to foreign investors Instead of helping investors differentiate risks the recent barrage of shocks has forced them to apply a broad brush again with Chinese companies the biggest losers from the shift An early version of this article was published online on September 27th 2021
 Sep 30th 2021,How a housing downturn could wreck China growth model,ADD “MALICIOUS price-cutting” to the growing lexicon of Xi Jinping China The phrase has cropped up in the past but is being increasingly used by provincial authorities to decry property developers’ attempts to slash home prices Some developers desperate to bring in revenue are offering discounts of as much as 30% Officials fearing that the price cuts might frustrate recent homebuyers and lead to protests and distortions in the property market regard the discounts as undermining social stability and have banned them In the central city of Yueyang the government has told developers to stop increasing prices but also to refrain from reducing them by more than 15%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn such cases both regulators and developers are walking a tightrope teetering between sky-high prices and a damaging downturn The property market is probably the single largest driver of the country economy Urban Chinese have flocked to it as a haven House prices have soared over the past 15 years often by more than 10% a year in large cities Yet developers have borrowed huge amounts in the process The industry total debt is about 184trn yuan $28trn equivalent to 18% of GDP according to Morgan Stanley a bank Housing costs relative to incomes now make large Chinese cities some of the least affordable places in the worldThese trends have collided with officials’ goals of reducing corporate indebtedness and inequality which lie at the heart of Mr Xi mission to bring “common prosperity” to China The campaign has already brought down several large real-estate companies as regulators have tightened their access to credit The latest is Evergrande a developer with about $300bn in liabilities that has started to miss payments on dollar bonds As The Economist went to press Evergrande seemed to have missed another offshore-bond payment due on September 29th The fear for officials is not just that the unwinding of the group will unleash systemic financial risks If the property sector were to tip into a correction everything from local-government and household finances to the country growth model would be imperilledChina leaders have cheered on the property boom for the best part of 30 years When the central government overhauled the tax system in 1994 local authorities lost a large chunk of revenue At the same time local governments were prevented from issuing debt Yet they were tasked with hitting high economic-growth targets sometimes exceeding 10% a year Selling land became one of the few things municipal officials could do to generate revenues which would in turn finance roads and other public works They could also set up companies that could borrow from banks and raise debt from other sources This arrangement meant economic growth was tightly bound to booming propertyBetween 1999 and 2007 the quantity of rural land transferred to urban use increased by an average annual rate of almost 23% and public-land sales soared by an average of 31% a year Soon the property market became the prime lever for controlling economic growth During the global financial crisis much of China $586bn stimulus package came in the form of loans and shadow-banking funds for developers “The property market was a vehicle for delivering the stimulus” says Kevin Lai of Daiwa Capital Markets a broker By 2010 land sales accounted for more than 70% of municipal incomes a year although the rate varied between regionsThe failure to break away from this setup is one of China biggest economic blunders of recent decades The relationship between the property market and overall growth remains as strong as ever Morgan Stanley reckons that residential property and related sectors make up 15% of GDP Another estimate by Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and Yuanchen Yang of Tsinghua University suggests that the economic importance of property rises to 29% once construction and other related industries are added in As a result homebuyers and developers alike have considered the housing market too important to fail finds Hanming Fang of the University of Pennsylvania They have treated their investments as one-way betsThe Evergrande crisis and some property indicators are beginning to threaten that long-held belief Malicious price-cutting may be in the headlines but only especially cash-strapped developers have resorted to it Yet demand is weakening from its high base One gauge is growth in prices which has slowed in recent months Another is the secondary market where speculative investors cash out In Shenzhen a southern boomtown transactions fell for four consecutive months to 2423 in August compared with a monthly average of 8376 in 2020 according to Rhodium Group a consultancyThe easy stream of credit that kept construction sites buzzing is drying up Access to bank and shadow-bank loans as well as demand for on- and offshore bonds is weakening for the industry in general says Cedric Lai of Moody a rating agency Net offshore dollar-bond issuance has turned negative for developers for the first time in at least a decade see chart 1 Land sales for residential projects declined in the first half of the year mainly because of government limits on bank exposures to developers S&P another rating agency has downgraded many developers to junk Moody says its outlook on China property sector is now negativeSuch news has grabbed the attention of local officials Declining demand for homes and a shortage of funds will mean less demand for land The development of a municipal-bond market over the past decade has helped some regions move away from land sales But on the whole local officials have only become more addicted Total government sales revenue has climbed since 2015 and reached about 83% of GDP in 2020 see chart 2 Any decrease bodes ill for the economies of smaller citiesHouseholds meanwhile are on some measures more exposed to property than ever In 2019 housing represented about 60% of their total assets financial assets accounted for just 20% This overreliance has driven up mortgage debt to about 76% of total household liabilities As developers lost other forms of funding over the past five years they became heavily reliant on pre-sales income where buyers pay for their homes sometimes in full months or years before completion Between 2015 and July 2021 the share of pre-sale revenue as a source of funding for developers rose from 39% to 54% according to Natixis a French bank Some of the people who paid in advance for Evergrande homes or bought one of the company wealth-management products have protested outside its officesInvestors are now waiting for government action Some expect that as the economic outlook darkens officials will ease monetary conditions Most banks have used up government quotas for property-sector loans this year says Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management a hedge fund based in Shanghai The quotas will be renewed in January leading to a burst in lending he says Raymond Yeung of ANZ a bank thinks that regulators are well enough informed of the risks that few other developers will encounter the same problems as Evergrande A property slowdown might knock a half of a percentage point off GDP growth this year he says Mo Ji of Fidelity International an asset manager says she expects the turbulence to take a percentage point off growthThe short-term outlook however might ignore a bigger secular shift Mr Lai of Daiwa says the market is “very close to the end of the housing boom” because the accumulation in debt cannot continue Efforts to make China more equal could mean more moderate price rises in future says Oxford Economics a consultancy Whether China unfavourable demographics can continue to support a market of this size over the next decade is an open question reckons Mr YeungFew options for decoupling economic growth from housing exist China should have focused more of its construction on megacities which tend to have diverse sources of funding and competent administrators says Andy Xie an economist Instead local officials in small towns have squandered land revenues often spending on vanity projects even as young workers leave for large cities For the economy to end its unhealthy dependence on property development it may be necessary for many local governments to cease to exist Correction October 8th 2021: An earlier version of this article said that residential property investment rather than the residential property sector more

 Sep 25th 2021,Why it is wise to add bitcoin to an investment portfolio,“DIVERSIFICATION IS BOTH observed and sensible; a rule of behaviour which does not imply the superiority of diversification must be rejected both as a hypothesis and as a maxim” wrote Harry Markowitz a prodigiously talented young economist in the Journal of Finance in 1952 The paper which helped him win the Nobel prize in 1990 laid the foundations for “modern portfolio theory” a mathematical framework for choosing an optimal spread of assetsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe theory posits that a rational investor should maximise his or her returns relative to the risk the volatility in returns they are taking It follows naturally that assets with high and dependable returns should feature heavily in a sensible portfolio But Mr Markowitz genius was in showing that diversification can reduce volatility without sacrificing returns Diversification is the financial version of the idiom “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”An investor seeking high returns without volatility might not gravitate towards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin given that they often plunge and soar in value Indeed while Buttonwood was penning this column that is exactly what bitcoin did falling 15% then bouncing back But the insight Mr Markowitz revealed was that it was not necessarily an asset own riskiness that is important to an investor so much as the contribution it makes to the volatility of the overall portfolioand that is primarily a question of the correlation between all of the assets within it An investor holding two assets that are weakly correlated or uncorrelated can rest easier knowing that if one plunges in value the other might hold its groundConsider the mix of assets a sensible investor might hold: geographically diverse stock indexes; bonds; a listed real-estate fund; and perhaps a precious metal like gold The assets that yield the juiciest returnsstocks and real estatealso tend to move in the same direction at the same time The correlation between stocks and bonds is weak around 02-03 over the past ten years yielding the potential to diversify but bonds have also tended to lag behind when it comes to returns Investors can reduce volatility by adding bonds but they tend to lead to lower returns as wellThis is where bitcoin has an edge The cryptocurrency might be highly volatile but during its short life it also has had high average returns Importantly it also tends to move independently of other assets: since 2018 the correlation between bitcoin and stocks of all geographies has been between 02-03 Over longer time horizons it is even weaker Its correlation with real estate and bonds is similarly weak This makes it an excellent potential source of diversificationThis might explain its appeal to some big investors Paul Tudor Jones a hedge-fund manager has said he aims to hold about 5% of his portfolio in bitcoin This allocation looks sensible as part of a highly diversified portfolio Across the four time periods during the past decade that Buttonwood randomly selected to test an optimal portfolio contained a bitcoin allocation of 1-5% This is not just because cryptocurrencies rocketed: even if one cherry-picks a particularly volatile couple of years for bitcoin say January 2018 to December 2019 when it fell steeply a portfolio with a 1% allocation to bitcoin still displayed better risk-reward characteristics than one without itOf course not all calculations about which assets to choose are straightforward Many investors seek not only to do well with their investments but also to do good: bitcoin is not environmentally friendly Moreover to select a portfolio an investor needs to amass relevant information about how the securities might behave Expected returns and future volatility are usually gauged by observing how an asset has performed in the past But this method has some obvious flaws Past performance does not always indicate future returns And the history of cryptocurrencies is shortThough Mr Markowitz laid out how investors should optimise asset choices he wrote that “we have not considered the first stage: the formation of the relevant beliefs” The return from investing in equities is a share of firms’ profits; from bonds the risk-free rate plus credit risk It is not clear what drives bitcoin returns other than speculation It would be reasonable to believe it might yield no returns in future And many investors hold fierce philosophical beliefs about bitcointhat it is either salvation or damnation Neither side is likely to hold 1% of their assets in itFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 25th 2021,China throws a wrench into a transpacific trade pact,CHINA’S REQUEST to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership CPTPP landed on the desk of Damien O’Connor trade minister of New Zealand on September 16th The location was a fitting nod to the deal history In 1999 a meeting between the trade ministers of two small export powerhouses New Zealand and Singapore kicked off what became one of the world largest free-trade areasListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen that alliance was first mooted China was a nascent trading nation and its economic heft was piddling Its share of global merchandise exports was 34% Last year that figure ran to 147% making China the only country in the world which accounts for a double-digit shareAmerica which signed up to join a forerunner of the CPTPP before pulling out in 2017 often sought to portray the bloc as a tool to keep China from exercising influence over trading rules It is still difficult to imagine China application being successful in the short term The CPTPP is a detailed agreement requiring deep economic integration and new members must be admitted by unanimous approval “China is surprisingly close to meeting CPTPP conditions in many areas But where there are gaps they’re huge” according to Jeff Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics PIIE a think-tank in Washington DC He reckons the country has made huge strides in recent years on intellectual-property and investment rights But the dominance of state-owned enterprises SOEs weak labour rights and concerns about data privacy leave a lot of ground to catch upThe treatment of SOEs is a perpetual bugbear of many of China trading partners To gain membership of the CPTPP Vietnam in particular had to agree to restrictions on support for its own state-run firms and increased transparency on their operations and structure which China would be expected to mirror Data governance is a case where China is if anything moving in the opposite direction to the one which would be needed for membership The CPTPP countries have committed themselves to promoting the cross-border transfer of information In contrast China has become the global exemplar of data localisation: a data-protection law passed last month will make it harder for foreign companies to move data out of the countryMoreover China is not the only country with a pending application The Taiwanese government lodged an application to join the bloc less than a week later Its diplomatic status vis-à-vis China makes its membership of any trade deal fraught but on strictly economic grounds it would have fewer hurdles to clearDespite the difficulties some member countries might look eagerly on the potential economic gains of having China on board Once it was thought that America would be the economic powerhouse in the bloc Today among CPTPP members only Canada and Mexico trade more with America than with China A PIIE paper published in 2019 estimated global income gains from the CPTPP as it stands run to $147bn a year If China were included that would rise to $632bn The benefits to many of the members would run to more than 1% of their national incomeChina is already the largest member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership a larger but shallower trade deal agreed last year It contains fewer conditions for membership but unlike the CPTPP includes every big South-East Asian economy as well as South Korea Membership of both if it were to happen would make China a formidable leader of commercial diplomacy in AsiaMost bets are that its bid to join the CPTPP will fail And yet not long ago few would have wagered that China would show more interest in membership than America If the application means little else it remains a stark illustration of just how quickly America commercial influence in Asia has waned For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 25th 2021,Beware the backlash as financiers muscle into rental property,BERLINERS MORE than four-fifths of whom rent their homes have an unusual opportunity on September 26th to vent their anger over the rising cost of housing A referendum on the same day as Germany national and municipal elections will give them a say on whether or not the city should in effect “expropriate” some of Germany largest residential-property firms affecting up to 240000 homes The vote is non-binding But its impact on the housing market is already having an effect On September 17th two giant property investment trusts Vonovia and a firm it is targeting in a €191bn $225 billion takeover Deutsche Wohnen said they would sell almost 15000 flats to the city for €25bn They portrayed it as a friendly gesture But it was also a thinly veiled attempt to stop being stripped of the keys to their own homesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhatever the outcome of the referendum it serves as a warning for institutional investors piling into residential property in Europe and America Real-estate investment trusts REITs private-equity firms insurance companies and pension funds see the single-family rental housing market as a relatively high-yielding hedge against inflation that has been spared the impact of pandemic-related lockdowns on offices and shops But housing affordability has high political sensitivity In Berlin rents have roughly doubled in a decade Across Europe their rise has outpaced wage increases In America where a quarter of renters pay more than half of their income to landlords rents in June were up 75% compared with last year when they rose by 14% The highest increases were in Phoenix and Las Vegas up by 165% and 129% respectively over the same time period Nationally it is hard to lay the blame for the rent rises on institutional investors But in some cities where they concentrate their portfolios faceless megacorps are increasingly being seen as part of the problemThe biggest names are well known BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase asset-management business feature among the stampede of buyers KKR a private-equity firm is building out a new single-family landlord entity in America The sums involved are rising fast An estimated $87bn of institutional money went into America rental-home market during the first half of this year according to Redfin a residential brokerage Around 16% of single-family homes for sale were bought by investors in the second quarter up from more than 9% a year earlier A similar shift is under way in Europe where firms such as Goldman Sachs Aviva and Legal & General are wading into the market Lloyds Banking Group Britain largest mortgage lender is also moving into housing with a target to purchase 50000 homes within the next decade That could make it the country largest landlordIt is not the first time the investment market has been hot Blackstone a financial conglomerate was one of the first big investors to purchase foreclosed homes many of them vacant or in disrepair after the 2007-09 global financial crisis The firm showed up at foreclosure auctions in America courthouses and drove street by street comparing neighbourhoods and school districts In 2012 it paid $100000 for its first purchase in Phoenix Soon it was spending $125m on homes each week That same year Blackstone created Invitation Homes now the largest owner of single-family rental houses in America before taking it public in 2017 and selling off its shares two years later Today Invitation Homes owns 80000 homes out of a total market of 162m single-family rental homes Altogether the bet on housing earned Blackstone nearly $7bn in dividends paid before and since Invitation Homes listed its shares or more than twice its initial investment The firm which has returned to the market recently made a $6bn acquisition of Home Partners of America which owns more than 17000 single-family homes It gives its tenants the option to buyThe main impetus for the renewed investor enthusiasm is different from a decade ago It is partly because of demography Following the financial crisis many millennials favoured metropolitan flats as they established their careers As more of them enter middle agethe 35- to 44-year-old age cohort in America is expected to grow at double the pace of the average over the next five yearsthey want more space It is also because of the pandemic If remote working remains attractive it will increase demand for homes that are farther from city centres That helps explain why institutional buyers have piled into secondary cities such as Phoenix Raleigh Greensboro and DaytonMany of this cohort would prefer to buy than to rent but high house prices are an impediment In America the median home cost around 43 times the median household income in 2019 up from 39 times in 2002 In Britain the average home currently costs more than eight times average earningsa level that has only been breached twice in the past 120 years Even if rents are rising too leasing a suburban home with an office and room to raise children can be an interim optionSome people blame large investors for both skyrocketing house prices and rising rents At an aggregate level that a hard case to make Professional investors own just 2% of the total rental-housing stock in America In Europe less than 5% of residential real estate is in the hands of large publicly traded funds But in those cities where institutional investors are increasingly active they may have more of an impact They also frequently pay with cash giving them an edge over buyers with a mortgage in a competitive market One in six home sales in America went to an investor between April and June according to Redfin In cities such as Atlanta Miami and Phoenix the figure was one in fourThat may explain some of the political scrutiny “Institutional investors are walking on a tightrope” says Cedrik Lachance of Green Street a property-analysis firm On the one hand rising rents make investments more attractive On the other hand they invite tougher policy responses The White House is placing limits on the sale of lower cost homes to large investors In Ireland property taxes were raised to stop institutional investors from snapping up family homes that would normally be marketed to first-time buyersSuch regulatory responses may be crowd pleasers They will not solve the rental problem One study showed that rent-control policies in Catalonia a region of Spain not only failed to make the market more affordable but actually worked against it The number of homes available fell by 12% while prices remained unchanged Similarly researchers studying the impact of a five-year rent freeze in Berlin found that the number of rental properties slumped last year Catalonia law has been challenged by a constitutional court Berlin has been struck downInstead more homebuilding is the answer Some landlords argue that they increase the housing stock by offering developers the certainty of bulk purchases Lennar America largest home builder by revenue recently signed a $4bn deal with investors that includes building over 3000 homes Additionally REITs in America such as Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent are either building more homes or striking partnerships with homebuilders to boost their supply In Britain where one in five newly built homes could be institutionally-owned by the end of the decade Lloyds has announced a fund to boost house building in return for a share of the profit Professional landlords that own multiple properties also claim that they’re able to offer better services more maintenance and longer leases than individual landlords who could sell up at any momentBut in the wake of the pandemic homebuilding globally is anaemic Shortages of labour and material have stalled growth Fewer homes coming onto the market meant that single-family institutional investors in America increased their portfolios by 15% in 2020 down from 92% in 2018 according to Amherst Capital a property firm Less homebuilding increases the chance that rents will continue to rise Annual returns in America and Europe are expected to be as high as 151% and 175% respectively over the next few years The asset class will therefore remain enticing from an income standpoint but more risky from a regulatory one Even if a majority of Berlin renters vote against the landlords it hard to imagine meaningful law changes to curb property rights But for the greediest investors the writing is on the wall four windows and a door For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 25th 2021,America debt ceiling is a disaster though fiscal rules can help,IT IS ONCE again time for that most bizarre of economic spectacles a debt-ceiling showdown in America In the name of fiscal responsibility the world biggest economy is flirting with an act of brazen irresponsibility: a sovereign default The government has just about exhausted its current statutory debt limit of $285trn after which it will struggle to honour its obligations Janet Yellen the treasury secretary has warned that the government will probably run out of cash sometime next monthListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMost economists and executives assume that America will come to its senses before then After all Congress simply has to raise or suspend the debt limit which it has done nearly 80 times since 1960 even if occasionally leaving it to the last minute Should that occur againand it almost certainly willthe debt ceiling will fade from view until the next clash serving mainly as evidence of America polarised politics as if any were neededAmerica ritualistic threats of economic self-harm are unique But the debt ceiling is an extreme version of something that many other countries do: they limit government borrowing through fiscal rules Germany applies a “debt brake” capping its structural deficit at 035% of GDP though it has ignored that cap since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic In Britain the Conservative government aims to match its spending and revenues over a three-year horizon Rishi Sunak the chancellor is expected to unveil even tighter rules in next month budget including a commitment to lower the debt-to-GDP ratioThe purpose of fiscal rules is to deal with what economists call a “common pool” problemnamely that beneficiaries of government spending ignore the costs imposed on taxpayers and future generations The fear is that without a strict cap on spending elected officials will burn through cash Taken to an extreme bond and currency markets might punish profligacy Better not to test them Hence the need supposedly for clear boundariesYet the past decade has shown that the boundaries are quite a bit wider and fuzzier than previously thought In America federal debt was about one-third of GDP in 2000; today it is just about 100% Far from precipitating a financial meltdown the rising debt burden has become more not less manageable thanks to ultra-low interest rates In nominal terms the cost of servicing all the debt the annual interest payments on it is just over 1% of GDP nearly half what it was two decades ago Similar trends have played out throughout the rich world There may be no such thing as a free lunch but governments have learned that they can get much larger portions for half the priceOne response is to soften the limits Take the European Union rule that member states must cap their debt at 60% of GDPwhich is largely observed in the breach with average EU debt levels now hurtling past 90% of GDP Economists such as Zsolt Darvas of Bruegel a think-tank suggest that this limit should be treated as a long-term anchor rather than any kind of near-term targetSuch a softening would help But it would fail to deal with a more basic flaw with debt limits which is that they are intrinsically arbitrary There is little empirical basis for keeping debts to 60% of GDP much less to exactly $285trn in America The very arbitrariness of these red lines risks creating a boy-who-cried-debt syndrome As borrowing levels blow past them and yet the economy continues to perform well some politicians may conclude that any and all calls for fiscal restraint are best ignoredA more sophisticated response is to focus fiscal rules on what really matters about debt: the cost of servicing it In a paper in 2020 Larry Summers and Jason Furman suggested that governments should aim to stop their real interest payments from rising above 2% of GDP If they succeed debt-to-GDP targets would be rendered all but superfluous More generally economists recognise that so long as a country pace of growth is higher than its interest rates its path to fiscal sustainability ought to be easier because its burden of existing debts will steadily shrinkHowever these more elegant fiscal rules have their own problems Why cap debt-servicing costs at 2% of GDP and not say 3% Moreover the confidence that economic growth can surpass interest rates stems from the belief that rates will remain subdued well into the future as the population ages But America's ongoing bout of inflation has shown just how uncertain that is Should central banks need to jack up interest rates to quell price pressures debts would quickly spiral higherYou only give me your funny paperDoing away with indefensible lines in the sand altogether is a good alternative In a paper this year Peter Orszag Robert Rubin and Joseph Stiglitz argue for a new fiscal architecture An important part would be to index long-term spending to underlying drivers For example social-security benefits could automatically be made less generous to take into account increasing life expectancy This can be thought of as a fiscal rule that would commit governments to sensible budgetary decisions rather than specifying debt targets with spurious precisionIn another paper this year Olivier Blanchard and others proposed general fiscal standards for the EU such as requiring governments to ensure that their debts are sustainable but leaving it to them to choose their policy mixes Independent fiscal councils could then use detailed debt-sustainability criteria to assess their budgets If done methodically this would be more scientific than the fiscal rules now seen in America and EuropeAlas all these clever ideas may amount to nothing in America There is little chance that the government will abandon its debt ceiling for in one dimension it is most effective Republicans have become dab hands at wielding it as a cudgel to stall the agendas of Democrat presidents and to portray them as spendthrifts No other fiscal rules can deliver that kind of return For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 23rd 2021,How threatening are the high levels of corporate debt?,ON SEPTEMBER 20TH the Bank for International Settlements BIS the central banks’ central bank released data showing that corporate borrowing around the world remains at an all-time high A notable case is in China where there is even more business borrowing as a share of GDP than in Japan at the peak of its bubble-related borrowing spree in the 1990s But it is high everywhere see chart Corporate debt in the rich world stood at 102% of GDP at the end of March compared with 92% before the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic Could high levels of debt threaten the recovery in advanced economies?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMany regulators were sounding the alarm about elevated company debt even before the covid-19 pandemic Since then the hit to firms’ incomes has led to a wave of rating downgrades: between March 2020 and March 2021 Fitch a ratings agency downgraded 460 firms or almost 20% of its corporate portfolio While defaults have eased this year as economies have recovered many firms will be burdened by higher levels of debt for years to come Even if interest rates remain low this “debt overhang” could affect their willingness to invest or to hire new staffIntriguingly however hangovers from corporate-debt booms rarely cause significant economic damage even if creditors themselves suffer when firms default A recent paper by Moritz Schularick of the University of Bonn and several coauthors examines data on business cycles for 17 advanced countries over more than a century and compares corporate-debt busts with those associated with household borrowing like the 2008-09 financial crisisThe authors argue that lenders often have an incentive to restructure old corporate loans reducing the risk of “zombie” companies persisting and freeing up finance to support the next recovery For household debt however restructuring thousands of individual loans is often impossible and lenders may be more inclined to keep the loans on their books in the hope that house prices eventually recover The risks to the economy are higher after commercial-property busts than for corporate debt where lenders mainly have their eyes on firms’ cashflows This is one reason why the property-related debt woes in China are potentially disturbingIn much of the rich world there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic The largest lenders are in much better health than in 2008 All of the major regulatory authorities carried out stress tests during 2020 using macroeconomic scenarios much more severe than have actually transpired but their banking systems were able to absorb large corporate losses and carry on lending And the parts of the economy that have had the toughest time during the pandemic only account for a relatively small share of corporate debt For example modelling by Benoît Mojon Daniel Rees and Christian Schmieder of the BIS projects that defaults will increase in the hospitality industry over the coming years but they note that the sector only accounts for between 15% and 8% of corporate credit in the nine major economies they modelThere will be a mountain of corporate debt in many countries for some time But that does not mean the recovery will necessarily falter For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The volatility leading up to the expected default on September 23rd has already given investors a taste of the risks emanating from China deleveraging campaign However many analysts still believe severe contagion can be ring-fenced to groups with known connections to Evergrande and other weak property developersStart with banks the main area of regulatory concern China banks have lent heavily to developers A recent central-bank stress test on banks’ exposure to the property sector concluded that an extreme scenario in which loans to developers suffered a 15-percentage-point rise in their non-performing ratios would eat up 21 percentage points of banks’ overall capital-adequacy ratios reducing the industry average to 123% Such a drop in the banks’ capital buffers evenly spread across the banking sector would be a tolerable depletion of protection But such a crisis would not hit banks evenly; weaker banks would see a much larger reduction according to analysts at S&P Global a ratings agencyPing An Bank and Minsheng Bank both hit by sell-offs in recent days had big shares of their total loan books extended to property groups in the first half of the year see chart Minsheng has tight links to Evergrande Shengjing Bank which is majority-owned by Evergrande is thought to have lent heavily to the property company A banking crisis is not the base case for many investors watching the situation But “the situation would change very quickly” if a bank of Minsheng scale proved vulnerable says a China-based executive at an asset manager Central authorities would probably step in swiftly at the first sign of distress at a major bank the investor addsOf more immediate concern are Evergrande links to China shadow-banking system About 45% of its interest-bearing liabilities in the first half of 2020 were from trusts and other shadow lenders which are opaque and typically charge higher rates compared with just 25% for bank loans according to Gavekal a research firmPanic in the offshore bond market is another worry Chinese developers are the largest issuers of dollar-denominated bonds traded in Hong Kong and among them Evergrande is the single largest issuer The company bonds have traded at less than 30 cents to the dollar over the past week Many other developers’ yields have shot up above 30% Investors are waiting for a signal from Beijing So far the absence of any strong sign of support has shown that regulators do not want to step in as they did recently with Huarong a state-owned investor in distressed debt that required a full bail-out in August The treatment of Huarong which is intricately connected to China financial system suggests that Mr Xi is still intent on avoiding a generalised market meltdownIf Evergrande does default there is still the possibility that the government may step in to help individuals The state which is likely to be worried by protests in recent days by savers who have bought Evergrande wealth-management products is expected to be forced to broker a partial bail-out for assets most connected with social stability Such a process would be focused on the properties the company has already sold to ordinary people and which are not yet built Capital Economics a research firm estimates there are about 14m of those This could involve a number of companies carving up construction projects across the country and taking over assets in the provinces where they are based By keeping these projects under development suppliers and contractors would also in effect be bailed outOne difficulty in organising such a bail-out will be finding buyers The crackdown on leverage has left few developers with excess cash to make such purchases That means local governments may need to step in to help outPerhaps the biggest contagion risk flaring up in the market is not that posed by Evergrande itself but by Mr Xi unyielding crackdown on leverage Logan Wright of Rhodium Group a research firm sees Evergrande not as the root cause of the troubles in China property sector Instead it is a symptom of the government efforts to reshape the market Mr Wright says the assault on China vibrant tech sector suggests Mr Xi will see the deleveraging campaign throughThese implications are bigger than the current market rout China property sector accounts for 20-25% of its economy An extended campaign against developer debt could significantly lower China growth prospects says Tommy Wu of Oxford Economics a research firm Such a strategy could lead to much greater economic and financial turmoil farther down the road It would also raise further questions about where Mr Xi relentless and wide-reaching campaigns are leading China For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

a fifth comes from hydropower But hydropower generation has been low because of a drought And coal demand fell partly because of environmentally friendly policies such as replacing coal-burning boilers with gas ones Investment in mining coal has also been low That meant more reliance on natural gas In the first half of the year gas generation grew quicker than coal or hydropower Chinese LNG imports grew by 26% from the previous yearOther countries have seen higher demand too partly because of the warm summer in Asia In addition Japan South Korea and Taiwan have been topping up their storage facilities Meanwhile a drought in Latin America which gets half its power from hydro has increased the need for gas there The region LNG demand has almost doubled in the past yearBooming demand has been met with lower supply of LNG A long list of small disruptions has nibbled away at global output Some of the outages were caused by maintenance work delayed during the covid pandemic Others such as a fire at a Norwegian LNG plant were unplanned The combined effect of all these disruptions was to cut global LNG supply by roughly 5% estimates Mike Fulwood of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies Mr Fulwood daughter works at The EconomistWith LNG being sucked into Asia less has been left for European buyers LNG imports into Europe are about 20% lower than they were last year Gas inventories are about 25% below their long-term average Gas production has also dropped in Britain and the Netherlands Analysts had expected Russia Gazprom which supplies a third of Europe gas to make up the difference But even though it met all of its long-term gas contracts to Europe this year it has not sold additional gas in the spot market Some suspect Gazprom wants to speed up the launch of Nord Stream 2 a big gas pipelineEurope has been hit by peculiar weather in other ways Across the north-west of the continent the air has been still reducing wind generation In Germany for example during the first two weeks of September wind-power generation was 50% below its five-year average Moreover usually European utilities respond to high gas prices by using more coal But the price of coal is also at near-record highs on the back of demand for electricity and production bottlenecks The cost of European carbon permits is at record highs too These give the holder the right to emit an amount of greenhouse gases Because burning coal emits more than burning natural gas expensive carbon permits add even more to the priceAmerica gas market has responded to international demand In the first half of the year America exported about a tenth of its natural-gas production a 42% increase on the year before according to the Energy Information Administration a government statistical agency But even if America produced more domestically it would not help to balance the international LNG market LNG facilities in America are running nearly at full capacity So are liquefaction facilities in other big gas-producing countries such as Australia and Qatar Expanding LNG plants is possible Qatar plans to increase its capacity by 50% but takes years to doWhat could bring the heat out of the market in the short term? One possibility is substitution That has begun to happen in some places Europe is burning more coal than this time last year Some power plants in Pakistan and Bangladesh switched to oil from LNG Another possibility is an increase in supply from Russia But it is unclear how much more Russia can produce A final possibility is warmer weather But meteorologists are already forecasting a cold winter Gas prices are unlikely to come down to earth soonFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 18th 2021,How America should spend on child care,UNLIKE MOST rich European countries America lacks a coherent public child-care regime But it has come surprisingly close to having one During the second world war Congress set up federal child-care centres to encourage women to work in factories; these were later dismantled In 1971 Congress passed a comprehensive child-care plan But President Richard Nixon vetoed the bill calling it “the most radical piece of legislation” to have crossed his desk and arguing that “good public policy requires that we enhance rather than diminish both parental authority and parental involvement with children” Now Democrats in Congress are trying again fashioning a child-care system as part of an enormous social-spending package It is expected to consist of a universal pre-kindergarten programme for three- and four-year-olds and free or heavily subsidised child care for most Americans The potential gains from more systematic support are large But there are trade-offs around its design tooListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe case for some sort of state intervention is straightforward As any new parent will readily confirm child care across the rich world is eye-wateringly expensive Women are disproportionately likely to stay at home to look after their children so encouraging them to work in the formal sector could increase gender equality For some children formal care doubles up as education helping overcome the disadvantages associated with their family circumstances Some public spending on child care has such vast benefits in later life that in broad terms it is an investment that pays for itself Research led by James Heckman of the University of Chicago for instance has found that spending on some high-quality programmes for children from birth until their fifth year generated an internal rate of return of 14%Once convinced that there is a case for intervention governments must consider how to design their schemes: who should be eligible and what sort of care to provide The system must not only free up parents to work and be good for children; the benefits must also exceed the costs to the public purse There is clear evidence that mothers gain from child-care policy Many studies find that universal schemes ie those that apply to families of all incomes boost labour-force participation In 1997 the Canadian province of Quebec implemented a full-time universal scheme costing parents just C$5 and later C$7 $4-550 a day This raised mothers’ participation rates by nearly eight percentage pointsWhen it comes to children outcomes however the results are mixed The available research on existing schemes is often patchy The large returns on investment identified by Mr Heckman and his colleagues for instance relate to targeted programmes for poor families The outcomes of universal schemes though are less glowing One meta-analysis published in 2018 by Thomas van Huizen and Janneke Plantenga of Utrecht University examined 30 studies of such programmes Only a third found a positive effect of the schemes on children outcomes and a fifth found negative effects Though the scheme in Quebec raised mothers’ participation substantially a study by Michael Baker of the University of Toronto Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kevin Milligan of the University of British Columbia found that children suffered worse cognitive and health outcomesThe literature review also found that poor children gained the most from universal programmes One oft-cited study by Tarjei Havnes then at the University of Oslo and Magne Mogstad of the University of Chicago examined what happened to Norwegian children born in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a heavily subsidised child-care scheme began expanding They found strong positive effects on future earnings for poor children but negative effects on rich ones whose parents would otherwise have provided better child care than the state The researchers conclude “that the benefits of providing subsidised child care to middle and upper-class children are unlikely to exceed the costs”Added to this universal care could be regressive Across rich European countries low-income families are a third less likely to use early child-care schemes than richer ones In America poorer families are more likely to tell surveys that they prefer informal family-based child care to formal care That suggests that a universal offering would direct public funds to those who do not need it and that means-testing is a more efficient way to target supportHaving decided who should receive help the next question is how to deliver it Here the evidence suggests that quality matters a lot for children outcomes Full-time programmes do not necessarily deliver better results than part-time ones The disappointing results from Quebec are often attributed to wildly disparate standards By contrast a study by Mr Havnes and Nina Drange of Statistics Norway of a lottery to enter toddlers into a care scheme in Oslowhere quality is closely regulated by the statefound big improvements in standardised tests taken at age sevenChild playLeft-leaning American politicians like Elizabeth Warren tend to talk in terms of “underinvestment” and “child-care deserts” But if existing child-care arrangements are low-quality then spending alone will not improve outcomes for children A framework that weighs up the benefits of spending on child care for families and setting that against the costs is essential if the policy is to help the most in need Without it child care in America also risks becoming subject to an unseemly mess of regulations: the same tangle of subsidies supply restrictions and poor quality that afflicts higher education and health careAs America attempts to Europeanise its safety-nets the question is not whether a more coherent child-care regime ought to exist but how it should be designed Fifty years after Nixon vetoed universal child care the search is still on for a truly effective American nanny state For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 18th 2021,Labour share in national income is both over- and under-explained,THE IDEA that the spoils of the modern economy are unfairly distributed has become part of public discourse in the rich world One common villain is the growing class of wealth-owners living off the returns from capital rather than hard-earned wages an explanation popularised by Thomas Piketty in his book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” published in 2013 The idea has gained currency with politicians And studying the “labour share” the slice of national income earned by workers through wages has become something of a cottage industry in economicsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA new paper by Gene Grossman and Ezra Oberfield of Princeton University trawls Google Scholar and finds that more than 12000 economics papers containing the words “labour share” and “decline” have been written in the past decade Their review of the research suggests that economists’ understanding of why workers are taking home a smaller slice of the pie is murky at bestOne reason for this involves measurement difficulties Official statistics suggest that America labour share fell by about six to eight percentage points between the 1980s and the 2010s But Messrs Grossman and Oberfield list a number of recent papers that cast doubt on the numbers A change to American tax law in 1986 for instance lowered taxes for partnerships and other “pass-through corporations” which had the effect of distorting the measurement of wages After the tax cut many more business owners began classifying their firms as pass-through corporations and their earnings as profits which led to a decline in measured wagesAnother distortion comes from the use of gross national income to calculate the labour share rather than a net measure that takes account of the depreciation of assets Using the net measure which may better capture income available for consumption suggests a smaller fall in the labour share That is because the growth of assets like computers has pushed depreciation rates up and weighed on net profits and national income over time That in turn increases the labour share todayMessrs Grossman and Oberfield put forward another reason for why the decline in the labour share is not well understood: economists’ many explanations are not consistent with each other Researchers consider everything from automation to offshoring and rising corporate concentration They use sophisticated methods to estimate the role of a given factor holding everything else constant But when the estimates are added together the resulting number is too large Messrs Grossman and Oberfield reckon that the total might come to three or four times the amount that the labour share actually fell byWhy is this the case? The authors argue that researchers are proposing proximate causes for the decline rather than fundamental ones Many of the supposedly distinct factors may simply be different ways of labelling the same thing Advances in information technology for instance have enabled the automation of many clerical jobs while also enhancing the market power of some firms Economists can tell themselves lots of stories and those stories might even enter public discourse But the truth remains elusive

 Sep 18th 2021,Is China already the world most dominant economy?,IN 2010 WHEN President Barack Obama welcomed his Chinese counterpart to a summit in Washington DC he greeted him with a handshake and a swift shallow dip of the head The image of America president bowing before China made an arresting cover photo for the book “Eclipse” published the following year The book written by Arvind Subramanian of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a Washington-based think-tank predicted that China would soon come to dominate the world economy and that America could do precious little about it Your correspondent once included the cover image in a presentation at the Central Party School in Beijing It caused quite a frissonListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo gauge a country economic “dominance” Mr Subramanian combined its share of world trade net capital exports and global GDP measured at both market exchange rates and purchasing-power parities which try to correct for international differences in the price of similar goods He gave each attribute a weight loosely based on the IMF formula for allocating votes to its members His index he argued successfully captured Britain economic hegemony in 1870 its rivalry with Germany in 1913 and its eclipse by America in the subsequent decadeAccording to this measure Mr Subramanian predicted China would become the world most dominant economy by 2020 In the ten years since that forecast China has faced a trade war with America its growth has slowed and its currency has suffered bouts of volatility obliging it to tighten controls on capital outflows Yet Mr Subramanian central prediction has come true Based on the book original formula China became the world most dominant economy last year see chart Its growth slowdown has been no worse so far than Mr Subramanian expected and the covid-19 pandemic has helped increase its share of global tradeMr Subramanian successfully predicted how his own index would evolve But does his index successfully capture economic dominance? Other authors have included wealth GDP per person and other proxies for economic sophistication as well as scale Our favourite index of a country global influence put together by Francesc Pujol of the University of Navarra counts the number of times a country appears in the charts of The Economist These measures give America a bigger edgeFor the sake of tractability Mr Subramanian measure gives every dollar of exports equal weight But some of America high-tech exports appear to give it an economic “chokehold” over China that is worth more than their market value Mr Subramanian thought that China growing share of GDP and trade could soon elevate its currency into a rival to the dollar But China yuan has made little headway That is partly because China has tightened capital controls a possibility that Mr Subramanian acknowledged But he thought that if China clung to such controls it would be to keep the yuan cheap by preventing capital inflows not to prop the yuan up by deterring capital outflows Still given the sorry record of most economic predictions the book author deserves a handshake and a bow For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 17th 2021,How World Bank leaders put pressure on staff to alter a global index,THE WORLD BANK’S Doing Business rankings which are followed closely by leaders in China India and elsewhere are supposed to gauge how easy it is to do business in 190 countries But the rankings have instead become a revealing gauge of how the World Bank itself does business under political pressure In so doing they have also created a dilemma for the bank sister institution the IMFIn January the bank appointed a law firm to investigate allegations that the scores for China and three other countries Azerbaijan Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had been altered Its findings released on September 16th provide a startlingly frank blow-by-blow account of the bank efforts in 2017 to engineer an improvement in China ranking According to the investigators the amendments reflected pressure from aides to Jim Yong Kim the World Bank president at the time “presumably” at his direction And the effort was ultimately led by Kristalina Georgieva who was then second-in-command at the bank and is now the boss of the IMFIt was an awkward time for the bank Some of its harshest critics were in office in America Treasury Department as part of President Donald Trump administration Many of the bank biggest clients could borrow larger sums with fewer strings attached from China or the financial markets And the distribution of shares and therefore voting rights in the bank was hopelessly outdated failing to reflect the rise of emerging economiesSince a country votes in the bank are tied to its financial contributions a solution seemed obvious The bank should raise more capital from its members with emerging economies contributing a larger share than in the past But to get America and Japan to agree to that the bank needed China to accept a smaller increase in its financial contributions and therefore its vote share than the country economic size would warrant so that it did not become too influential The bank leaders thus found themselves in a paradoxical position They wanted to keep China happy so that it would agree to stump up less money for the bank than was merited for such a big economyBut even as the bank was losing prominence as a lender its Doing Business rankings were becoming ever more visible grabbing the attention of some of the world most powerful people Both Vladimir Putin of Russia and Narendra Modi of India had set high-profile targets for lifting their countries in the rankings Li Keqiang China prime minister had put a team of perhaps 40 people in place to improve China lowly position 78th at the timeAt Mr Li urging China reformers set about cutting red tape with some gusto The country officials told World Bank staff how much they were looking forward to seeing China rise in the rankings Sadly many of these reforms took place too late to make the cut for the Doing Business report scheduled for release in late 2017 Although China score had improved it was set to fall to 85th place because other countries did even better “I think I’m going to cry” one aide to Mr Kim wrote in an email when told that China would dropIn October 2017 after the rankings were ready for the printer Mr Kim aides discussed ways to improve China position with the Doing Business team Perhaps China score could include Macau? But the bank had no data for the city Perhaps Hong Kong? Too politically touchyAt that point Ms Georgieva was put in charge of the issue According to the investigators “a small group of Doing Business leaders” helped by Simeon Djankov who had created the rankings in 2003 ultimately found a way to improve China score on the ease of starting a business obtaining credit and paying taxes They decided for example not to count two procedures opening a bank account and obtaining financial invoices required to start a business And they undid a previous correction to China score on the legal rights of secured creditorsHow arbitrary were these tweaks? One staff member told the investigators that there was a “reasonable question” about China scores on these matters And it is plausible that was what Ms Georgieva also believed But the investigation makes clear that these tweaks were an attempt to improve China ranking not an attempt to improve the bank method And an internal review by the bank itself released in December 2020 said that the tweaks were “not justified by the Doing Business methodology or by any new information provided to the Doing Business team”The investigation findings pose two immediate questions: what should now happen to the rankings? And what should happen to Ms Georgieva? The fate of the Doing Business rankings has already been decided The bank has said it will abandon the exercise That is perhaps inevitable given the damage to their reputation and credibility This is not their first scandal: Paul Romer resigned as the bank's chief economist in 2018 after saying he could not defend the integrity of the rankings Still the project demise is a pity Ranking countries against each other was gimmicky but it won the attention of leaders in pursuit of bragging rights By measuring concrete regulations that governments can feasibly change the scores helped to galvanise genuine reforms in some big economies including China It is also true that some governments “gamed” the rankings carrying out superficial reforms designed to improve their score without much improving life for businessesSome people see the episode as proof of “Goodhart law” which states that when a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure But the Doing Business rankings were always intended to motivate as well as measure to change the world not merely describe it If these rankings had never captured the imagination of world leaders if they had remained an obscure technical exercise they might have been better as measures of red tape But they would have been worse at cutting itAnd what about Ms Georgieva? “I disagree fundamentally with the findings and interpretations of the investigation” she said in a statement on September 16th without elaborating When she was picked to run the fund in 2019 some wondered if Ms Georgieva a life-long technocrat had the political nous and diplomatic finesse to handle the more prominent IMF role Now it seems she was too diplomatic for her own good In helping to keep China happy she may have thought she was helping to salvage multilateralism But critics of multilateralism will have a field day with these findings citing them as proof that international institutions like the one she now runs cannot stand up to China
 Sep 16th 2021,A perfect storm for container shipping,A GIANT SHIP wedged across the Suez canal record-breaking shipping rates armadas of vessels waiting outside ports covid-induced shutdowns: container shipping has rarely been as dramatic as it has in 2021 The average cost of shipping a standard large container a 40-foot-equivalent unit or FEU has surpassed $10000 some four times higher than a year ago see chart The spot price for sending such a box from Shanghai to New York which in 2019 would have been around $2500 is now nearer $15000 Securing a late booking on the busiest route from China to the west coast of America could cost $20000Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn response some companies are resorting to desperate measures Peloton a maker of pricey exercise bikes is switching to air freight But costs are also sky-high as capacity half of it usually provided in the holds of passenger jets is constrained by curbs on international flights Home Depot and Walmart two American retailers have chartered ships directly Pressing inappropriate vessels into service has proved near-calamitous An attempt in July to carry containers on a bulk carrier which generally carts coal or iron ore was hastily abandoned when the load shifted forcing a return to port More containers are travelling across Asia by train Some are even reportedly being trucked from China to Europe then shipped across the Atlantic to avoid clogged Chinese portsTrains planes and lorries can only do so much especially when it comes to shifting goods halfway around the planet Container ships lug around a quarter of the world traded goods by volume and three-fifths by value The choice is often between paying up and suffering delays or not importing at all Globally 8m TEUS 20-foot-equivalent units are in port or waiting to be unloaded up by 10% year-on-year At the end of August over 40 container ships were anchored off Los Angeles and Long Beach These serve as car parks for containers says Eleanor Hadland of Drewry a shipping consultancy in order to avoid clogging ports that in turn lack trains or lorries to shift goods to warehouses that are already full The “pinch point” she adds “is the entire chain”For years container shipping kept supply chains running and globalisation humming Shipping was “so cheap that it was almost immaterial” says David Kerstens of Jefferies a bank But disruption after disruption means that the metal boxes are losing their reputation for low prices and reliability Few experts think things will get better before early next year The dislocations could even hasten a reordering of global tradeShipping is so strained in part because the industry which usually steams from short-lived boom to sustained bust was enjoying a rare period of sanity in the run-up to the pandemic Stephen Gordon of Clarksons a shipbroker notes that by 2019 it was showing self-discipline with the level of capacity and the order book for new ships under control Then came covid-19 Shipping firms expecting a collapse in trade idled 11% of the global fleet In fact trade held up and shipping rates started to climb And flush with stimulus cash Americans started to spendIn the first seven months of 2021 cargo volumes between Asia and North America were up by 27% compared with pre-pandemic levels according to BIMCO a shipowners’ association Port throughput in America was 14% higher in the second quarter of 2021 than in 2019 There has been little growth elsewhere: throughput in northern Europe is 1% lower Yet rates on all routes have rocketed see map because ships have set sail to serve lucrative transpacific trade starving others of capacityA system stretched to its limits is subject to a “cascading effect” says Eytan Buchman of Freightos a digital-freight marketplace Rerouting and rescheduling would once have mitigated the closure of part of Yantian one of China biggest ports in May and then Ningbo another port in August after covid-19 outbreaks But without spare capacity that is impossible “All ships that can float are deployed” remarks Soren Skou boss of Maersk the world biggest container-shipping firm Empty containers are in all the wrong places Port congestion puts ships out of service The average door-to-door shipping time for ocean freight has gone from 41 days a year ago to 70 days says FreightosSome observers think normality may return after Chinese new year next February Peter Sand of BIMCO says disruptions could even take a year to unwind Lars Jensen of Vespucci Maritime an advisory firm notes that a dockers’ strike on America west coast in 2015 caused similar disruption albeit only in the region It still took six months to unwind the backlogOn the demand side much depends on whether the American consumer appetite for buying stuff continues Although retail sales fell in July they are still 18% above pre-pandemic levels points out Oxford Economics a consultancy But even if American consumer demand slackens firms are set to splurge as they restock inventories depleted by the buying spree and prepare for the holiday season at the end of the year And there are signs that demand in Europe is picking upIn a sea of uncertainty one bedrock remains The industry flush with profits is reacting customarily setting an annual record for new orders for container-ship capacity in less than eight months of this year says Mr Sand But with a two-to-three-year wait this release valve will not start to operate until 2023 And the race to flood the market may not match torrents of the past There are far fewer shipyards today: 120 compared with around 300 in 2008 when the previous record was set And shipping responsible for 27% of global carbon-dioxide emissions is under pressure to clean up its act Tougher regulations come into force in 2023The upshot is that the industry “will remain cyclical” but with rates normalising at a higher level says Maersk Mr Skou Discipline in both ordering and managing capacity may prove more permanent aided by consolidation within the industryThe impact of higher shipping costs depends on the good being transported Those hoping to import cheap and bulky things like garden furniture might be in for a long wait Mr Buchman notes that current spot rates might add $1000 to the price of a sofa travelling from China to America The effects on product prices so far may have been dampened: around 60% of goods are subject to contractual arrangements with shipping rates agreed in advance and only 40% to soaring spot pricesBoxed inNonetheless for most products shipping costs tend to be a small percentage of the overall cost The boss of a large global manufacturer based in Europe says the extreme costs now are “bearable” Nor might shipping rates rise much more even if disruptions continue CMA CGM the third-largest container-shipping firm in the world stunned industry watchers on September 9th when it said that it would cap spot rates for ocean freight Hapag-Lloyd the fifth-largest rapidly followed suitDecarbonisation costs mean rates will eventually settle at higher levels than those before the pandemic Yet research by Maersk suggests that this may not affect customers much Even if sustainable fuel cost three times as much as the dirty stuff increasing per-container fuel costs to $1200 across the Pacific for a container loaded with 8000 pairs of trainers the impact on each item would be minimalInstead it is the problem of reliability that may change the way firms think “Just in time” may give way to “just in case” says Mr Sand as firms guard against supply shortages by building inventories far above pre-pandemic levels Reliability and efficiency might also be hastened by the use of technology in an industry that has long resisted its implementation As Fraser Robinson of Beacon another digital freight forwarder points out supply chains can be made sturdier by using data to provide better “visibility” such as over which suppliers and shipping companies do a better or worse job of keeping to timetables and ordering goods earlierThere is so far little evidence of “nearshoring” except in the car industry says Mr Skou But the combination of trade war geopolitics and covid-19 may together lead trade patterns to tilt away from China Some Chinese firms and the companies they supply are relocating production to lower-cost countries to diversify supply chains and circumvent trade barriers Mr Kerstens of Jefferies notes that after America under President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China the volume of trade from China to America fell by 7% in 2019 but American imports remained stable overall as places like Vietnam and Malaysia took up the slack Hedging against covid-19 shutdowns particularly given China zero tolerance for infections could provide another reason to move awayFor their part shipping firms may be preparing for more regionalised trade The order book is bulging for ships of 13000-15000 TEU smaller than the mega-vessels that can only be handled at the biggest ports Vietnam opened a new deepwater terminal in January which can handle all but those largest shipsFinding new manufacturers is hard however especially for complex products And building buffers into supply chains is costly But conversations about deglobalising are said to be starting among some makers of low-cost clothing and commodity goods If high costs and delays persist some will judge that the benefits of proximity to suppliers outweigh the costs of bringing in goods made far away With few alternatives to ships the only choice will be to move the factories that make them Correction September 13th 2021: The figures on port throughput in America and northern Europe have been corrected since publicationFor more

 Sep 16th 2021,China takes on Delta and its property developers at the same time,FOR SUCH a small place Singapore has exercised an outsized influence on China economy The city-state proved to reformers in China that a government could open up the economy without losing control “Society in Singapore is quite orderly” said Deng Xiaoping China paramount leader in 1992 “They managed things very strictly We ought to use their experience as a model and…manage things even better than they do”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKUnfortunately Singapore has not managed covid-19 as strictly as China would like A resident of China Fujian province who recently returned from Singapore tested positive earlier this month for the Delta variant He is thought to have passed it on to his son from whom it soon spread through his school Fujian has now recorded over 200 cases since September 10th Exchanges between Singapore and China coastal provinces the ancestral homelands for many Singaporeans have brought many benefits But this outbreak belongs in the other columnIn response officials in Putian a city with a population of 3m and Xiamen 5m have shut schools bars and other high-risk venues Economists worry that if the outbreak persists it will disrupt travel and shopping during China week-long holiday beginning on October 1st That would delay the recovery from a similar outbreak that ended only last month The cost of that scare became clearer with the release of economic data on September 15th One casualty was retail sales which rose nationwide by only 25% in nominal terms in August compared with a year earlier far weaker than expected Based on the data so far GDP in the third quarter is on course to shrink compared with the previous three months suggests a “tracking” estimate by Morgan Stanley a bankSingapore strictly managed property market is another model China reformers often admire but have failed to emulate But the government in Beijing is belatedly cracking down on indebted developers imposing curbs on their borrowing even as mortgage costs rise and potential homebuyers think twice Property firms sold 176% less residential floor space in August than a year earlier and the price of new homes fell in ten out of 70 big cities tracked by the National Bureau of Statistics Developers are now less willing and less able to build Investment in real estate was only 03% higher in August than a year agoChina exports have so far proved resilient: they were 25% higher in August than a year ago Indeed China manufacturers may have gained at the expense of countries that are struggling with worse covid-19 outbreaks of their own Moreover for as long as inflation remains subdued China has scope to ease monetary and fiscal policy to support growth It may thus combine tight control of infections property and other unruly industries with an easing of its macroeconomic stance a juggling act characterised as “micro takes macro gives” by analysts at Goldman Sachs another bankThe question is whether macro can give enough Analysts at China International Capital Corporation CICC an investment bank point out that China official fiscal deficit has been negligible so far this year The government therefore has room to spend more without revising its deficit target Sure enough bond issuance picked up last month and the government deposits with banks fell CICC reckons that China might increase spending on infrastructure at an annual rate of 5% in the last three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019 before the pandemicChina rulers hope that tighter regulations will help make housing more affordable and a less dominant part of the economy It is part of the “new development dynamic” touted by Xi Jinping China ruler But as this year wears on China development pattern is beginning to look wearily familiar: weak consumption strong exports and additional public investment to save the economy from past speculative excess Whatever might be said for this growth dynamic it is anything but new For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterAn early version of this article was published online on September 15th 2021
 Sep 16th 2021,America consumer-price inflation stays above 5% in August,IT IS HARD to overstate the time that goes into calculating a consumer-price index In America statisticians survey nearly 10000 people every quarter construct a sample of 80000 things they buy and then monitor their prices by ringing up thousands of shops restaurants and offices So the hard-working boffins might be miffed that the Federal Reserve thinks it wise simply to lop off the things with the biggest price swings The result that emerges is known as “trimmed mean” inflation With America facing its most sustained price pressure since 1990 this narrower measure is more than an academic exerciseListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn August the headline consumer-price index was 53% higher than a year ago according to data published on September 14th It was the third consecutive month of inflation at roughly that pace By contrast the trimmed-mean rateusing the Fed preferred measure the personal consumption expenditures PCE price indexhas remained at just about 2% in line with the central bank inflation target see chartThe gap between the headline scare and the subdued alternative gets to the heart of the debate about whether the burst of inflation is transitory or persistent Those taking the former view argue that a small number of things have driven the jump almost all traceable to pandemic-related disruptions The price of flights for example soared as air travel roared back but in August ticket prices slumped as the Delta variant of covid-19 dampened enthusiasm for travel The trimmed index is appealing because it strips out such outliersJerome Powell the Fed chairman has pointed to the measure as evidence that price pressures are not yet broad-based A similar story can be told in other countries In Britain consumer-price inflation soared to 32% year-on-year in August from 2% in July But that largely stemmed from a low base of comparison a year earlier when the government subsidised restaurant meals for a month A trimmed mean calculated by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research a think-tank indicates that Britain underlying inflation was just 16% in August barely higher than in JulyThere are two possible objections to the trimmed measure The first is that it is cherry-picking Central bankers often highlight narrower “core” inflation in order to capture deeper trends In the past the Fed would point to the PCE index excluding food and energy prices But this measure rose to 36% year-on-year in July a three-decade high Hence the suspicion that the trimmed mean is a handy substituteThat though is unfair to the Fed Central bankers have been tracking the trimmed measure since well before the pandemic The Dallas Federal Reserve has published a version since 2005 A research note by Fed economists released in 2019 found that trimmed-mean gauges are less volatile than headline indices and better predictors of future price changesBy focusing on the middle of the pack the trimmed mean reveals just how widespread pressures are The Dallas Fed orders all items from the highest price increase to the lowest and lops off the top 31% and the lowest 24% as judged by expenditure weights Trimming also answers a standard complaint about gauges that exclude food or energy prices: that people spend so much money filling their bellies and their petrol tanks that it makes little sense to ignore these costs Food and energy are included in trimmed indices so long as their price swings are not wildThe second objection is more damaging: that the trimmed mean flatters less than Mr Powell would have it Economists at the Dallas Fed say that when headline inflation exceeds the trimmed mean by one percentage point it feeds through to roughly a quarter point of extra trimmed-mean inflation in a year time On this basis the trimmed-mean rate may hit 25% next year A different trimmed mean calculated by the Cleveland Fed which snips less has already jumped climbing to 3% from 2% at the start of the yearHowever you trim the conclusion seems clear enough Inflation is not as bad as the headlines suggest But price pressures are steadily spreading For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletterAn early version of this article was published online on September 14th 2021
 Sep 11th 2021,How to turn NIMBYs into YIMBYs,ECONOMISTS DO NOT agree on much but they do almost all think that a shortage of housing is a big drag on the economy Zoning laws and conservation rules have proliferated since the 1960s with diktats on everything from the number of car-parking spaces to how pitched a roof must be These have made it harder to get projects off the ground: house-building in the rich world relative to population has fallen by 50% since 1964 Low housing supply means higher prices constraining cities’ growth and reducing productivity One estimate suggests that restrictions lowered American output growth by a third between the 1960s and 2009Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAlthough most housing experts want more building few spend much time thinking about how to make this happen Some pin their hopes on the “YIMBY” movemententhusiastic nerds who turn up to planning meetings and shout “yes” not “no” to having more houses “in my back yard” But YIMBYs are few and their power limited More encouragingly politicians are waking up to the damage caused by distorted housing markets In Britain the Conservative government talks a good game on boosting housebuilding On September 1st America White House decried “exclusionary zoning laws and practices” and promised to raise the supply of affordable housing Yet its talk of “relaunching partnerships” and “leveraging existing federal funds” hardly inspires confidence Better solutions are neededOne option is for the state to build houses itself Singapore has taken this route since the 1960s The government nationalised most land supply and built vast numbers of flats Today 80% of Singaporeans live in these buildings and housing costs are low In Russia the state has played a more Singaporean role in housing since 2000 Annual construction of new homes has tripledBut is more public housing enough? Few people including well-off Singaporeans dream of living in a government-built house The post-war push in the West to build huge housing projects meanwhile ended in failurewhen money was tight it was always easy to slash maintenance budgets The bigger question then is what needs to happen to boost private housebuildingHappily there are precedents In the decade to 2013 for instance Tokyo boosted its overall housing stock by over 1m more than double the increase in the 1980s Sydney has boosted annual completions by 50% since the early 2000s Such reforms can quickly have positive effects A new paper on São Paulo which enacted zoning reforms in 2016 finds that the policy boosted housing supply by 14% leading to a 04-1% reduction in pricesReforms are sometimes the outcome of crisis In normal times homeowners fiercely resist new developments because they worry that property prices will fall This was less of a concern for Tokyoites after Japan property bubble burst in 1992 In other cities the housing market is so dysfunctional that even NIMBYs recognise something must be done In San Francisco where the average house price is 24 times New York and rough sleeping is rife there is talk of a more pro-development approachYet waiting until a city is at risk of turning into San Francisco is hardly a viable strategy A more durable one involves recognising that the housing shortage is the result of skewed incentives and then correcting them That in turn means focusing on two groups: planners and homeownersTake planners first In many countries local governments assume this responsibility They must deal with the downsides of extra housesthe need to provide more school places for instance Yet they do not often reap the gains in the form of a bigger tax base since the majority of taxes in rich countries accrue at the national level In England councils that raise extra revenue often see it vanish into the central-government pot This creates large disincentives to allow housing developmentOne solution is to take power from local bureaucrats This was what São Paulo did Another involves incentivising local authorities to become more development-friendly Switzerland has gone furthest The cantonal system means that a high share of taxes raised locally stays there so for local governments more houses means more tax revenues Switzerland builds three times as many homes per person as Britain and construction continues to riseTweaking the incentives facing individuals may prove even more powerful The main reason for the long-run decline in housebuilding relates to rising homeownership More people on the property ladder means more voters with an interest in rising prices and so a political system that becomes hostile to development Yet it is possible to find solutions that allow homeowners to behave selfishly while still encouraging more buildingrelying on the same instinct that drives NIMBYism but for YIMBY endsBuilding a coalitionOne intriguing idea floated in a recent paper by Policy Exchange a British think-tank involves existing residents sharing the benefits of more building A street would vote to put extra floors on its houses or even rebuild with more homes and would keep the lion share of the profits accruing from the value of existing houses rising or from the sale of the new properties A similar scheme already exists in Israel where homeowners are granted development rights on their house which they can then sell to builders The programme has “played a huge role in supplying additional housing in recent years especially in high-demand areas” says Tal Alster of the Hebrew University of JerusalemMore creative ideas could be considered William Fischel of Dartmouth College has suggested that homeowners could take out “home-equity insurance” which would pay out in the event of falling house prices Others simply want to compensate NIMBYs in exchange for more building What is clear though is that no one needs any more papers showing that stringent zoning regulations raise housing costs It is time for solutions For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 11th 2021,Goldman Sachs taps public markets to bet on private equity,THE PAST decade has not been especially kind to investors in private equity Since 2010 they have poured $8trn into buy-out funds Yet the returns net of fees that these vehicles have delivered to their “limited partners” typically pension schemes endowments and other institutions have been similar to America comparable stock indexwith vastly more riskListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHence the boom in a more rewarding way to bet on private equity: investing in the asset managers themselves rather than their products On September 6th Goldman Sachs said it would float a new investment vehicle called Petershill Partners which will hold 19 minority stakes in private-equity groups and hedge-fund managers that together oversee $187bn The listing set to take place in about a month could value Petershill at more than $5bn making it the largest alternative-asset business listed in London Until now its assets have been managed by Goldman Petershill arm through private funds The bank will continue to make investments on investors’ behalf after the listing in return for feesThe attraction of the strategy is clear The profits distributed to limited partners by typical private funds are subject to the vagaries of the economic cycle but the management fees levied by buy-out firms themselvesgenerally 15-2% of the capital committed by limited partnersare locked in as soon as funds are raised And institutional investors hungry for returns amid low interest rates are piling into such funds Assets managed by the 19 firms that Petershill part-owns have swollen by 91% in aggregate since the stakes were bought That plus fresh acquisitions explains why the earnings Petershill distributes yearly to its own investors have more than doubled to $310m since 2018Yet until recently these investors could not easily cash out; Petershill private funds like most others have long durations That lack of liquidity probably kept some investors away Existing ones may have also been prevented from committing themselves to new funds The listing partly solves that problem by letting existing investors sell down 25% of their stake in Petershill It also lets the investment vehicle market its shares to retail investors rather than just a rich coterie of Goldman clients The unit also plans to sell $750m-worth of new shares providing it with more capital with which to fund acquisitions at a time when private markets are especially livelyInvestors are ravenous for a slice of private-equity action Shares in Bridgepoint a British buy-out firm that listed in July are 43% up on their debut price The five biggest listed private-equity firms have more than tripled in combined value since March 2020 Antin Infrastructure Partners a buy-out firm based in France has unveiled plans to raise €350m $413m through an initial public offering in ParisListing Petershill reflects Goldman desire to move away from volatile activities including bond and equity trading and focus instead on businesses that earn regular fees such as asset and wealth management Last month it agreed to buy the asset-management arm of NN Group a Dutch insurer for €16bn Petershill suggested price of $5bn at 22 times estimated net income in the year to June looks cheap compared with other listed private-equity stocks: Bridgepoint for instance trades at more than 30 times earnings All the better for the bank however if it helps peddle private equity to the masses For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 11th 2021,Do physical assets offer investors refuge from inflation?,LIKE PENGUINS and the melting ice cap investors’ natural habitat is changing Inflation is typically bad news for mainstream assets such as stocks and bonds because it reduces the present value of future earnings and coupons Yet this is where after a decade of slow growth and sluggish inflation investors have parked much of their trillions As consumer prices rise uncomfortably fast in much of the world they are scrambling to protect their portfolios from the changing economic climateListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA growing cohort is placing its faith in “real” assetsthe physical sort including property infrastructure and farmland Could these prove a haven in times of change? Investors certainly have good reasons to deem them safe places to perch Inflation often coincides with rises in the prices of these assets An economic expansion tends to fuel consumer-price growth as well as demand for floor space and transport or energy infrastructureMoreover these assets produce cash flows that usually track inflation Many property leases are adjusted annually and linked to price indices Somethose of hotels or storage space sayare revised even more often The revenue streams of infrastructure assets are typically tied to inflation too through regulation concession agreements or long-term contracts Meanwhile the rising maintenance or energy costs associated with these assets are often either passed through to tenants for property or fixed for long periods for infrastructure And debt raised against themoften fixed-rate and in copious amountsbecomes cheaper to repayAs a result real assets have done well during inflationary periods A recent report by BlackRock an asset manager suggests that the total returns of privately held property and infrastructure assets globally have beaten those of main stock and bond indices when inflation has exceeded 25% David Lebovitz of JPMorgan Asset Management reckons that a typical pension fund should start off by allocating 5-10% of its assets to them with the share rising to 15-20% over time Some big funds are in fact bolder: Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan which manages C$228bn $182bn wants to lift its allocation from 21% to 30%That might all sound very alluring but it should come with health warnings For one performance has become harder to predict: think of retail space and office blocks under threat from e-commerce and remote work airports and power plants exposed to decarbonisation and even farmland vulnerable to climate change The asset class may require a greater appetite for risk and more homework than its backers are used toAnother difficulty is that real assets are hard to access They are typically private meaning that only the most sophisticated investors have the resources and patience to find gems on their own The rest might gain exposure in public markets through real-estate investment trusts infrastructure stocks or exchange-traded funds But these tend to be closely correlated with equities defeating the point of investing in them Institutional investors also have access to private funds but these tend to deploy capital only slowly and come at a cost as their managers typically charge high feesIn any case real assets cannot insulate an investor entire portfolio against inflation Their merit is that they preserve their own value when inflation is high But to protect all of their capital investors must seek assets that do not just tread water but gain value more quickly during inflationary bursts than their other holdings depreciate And there is not a lot of consensus over which ones fit the bill Gold commodities inflation-linked bonds derivatives: each has champions and detractorsPerhaps the biggest danger though is that real assets fall victim to their success Many investors already turned to them over the past decade as they hunted for stable yields and sought diversification Between 2010 and 2020 private real assets under management more than doubled to $18trn Finding things to buy is getting harder Some $583bn raised by funds since 2013 remains unspent A bubble is possible says David Jones of Bank of America Merrill Lynch The definition of a real asset may become stretched Already some argue for it to include exotic fare such as non-fungible tokensdigital media recorded on a blockchain Rather like penguins that huddle ever closer on a shrinking bit of ice some investors might find themselves falling into treacherous watersFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

On employment there is reason for optimism It is certainly true as Mr Althoff and colleagues show that low-skilled service workers in cities bore much of the brunt of the downturn as well-paid folk retreated to their home offices In January this year lower-skilled workers in America densest commuting zones making up 40% of all workers in them accounted for almost 60% of working hours lost since the start of 2020Yet economies have been extraordinarily quick to reallocate jobs away from struggling city centres to places with more demand raising overall employment On a recent earnings call the CEO of Shake Shack a purveyor of sugar and fat said that its focus in the coming year would be “predominantly suburban Shacks” The nearest Pret A Manger to The Economist office in London has closed; but one is opening next to the Underground station near your correspondent house a few miles out Employment in Britain suburbs is up by 2% compared with a year ago even as nationwide employment is down In America too labour demand is shifting away from big cities see chart 2 There is however less evidence of egg-cracking in Australia which until recently had largely escaped the ravages of covid-19 Employment in Sydney continues to be concentrated in dense areasIt is harder to know whether the shift from city centres will harm productivity Were people stuck at home all the time making new connections and discovering new ideas would be difficult However even spending just 30% of working time at the officethe current average across American citiesmight not hit innovation all that much At home white-collar workers can complete taxing tasks in peace giving them time to collaborate when in the office That is the message from recent research by Humu a software firm which analysed call-centre employees at a large company before the pandemic One or two work-from-home days a week may make people more productive on both their at-home and in-office days By contrast with past recessions productivity growth in America has speeded up during the pandemic instead of slowing downCities could yet snap back to their pre-pandemic state: tourism could recover and bosses could insist that people return to the office But even if that does not happen cities will not be finishedMayors are shifting their focus from attracting firms to attracting residents and thus the property and consumption taxes they bring by improving quality of life Edinburgh George Street and London Oxford Circus are likely soon to be pedestrianised; San Francisco plans to make it permanently easier to set up outdoor dining Some California state senators also want to help turn underused retail property into the badly needed residential sort part of a wider push to boost housing supply The pandemic will not destroy citiesbut it will change them For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe

by 2016 that was down to 166% with the share of foreign content falling most sharply in electronics according to the OECD In other words more of the bits and bobs that end up in Chinese gadgets are themselves made in ChinaFace masks a must-have during the pandemic offer a vivid illustration of China strengths At the start of February it made about half the world supply 10m a day Within a month output had increased to nearly 120m That was not simply through exertion It was thanks to having “the world most complete supply chain” as Xinhua the state-run news agency put it A simple surgical mask consists of a woven layer fused to a non-woven layer elastic loops that go around your ears and a thin metal band to fasten it to your nose More sophisticated masks add a thin plastic filter and an activated carbon filter Any country hoping to make masks on its own needs companies with expertise in textiles chemicals metallurgy and machining along with sufficient supplies of raw materials factory space trained workers engineers and capital It cannot just be done from scratch and a similar story plays out across thousands of productsThe second advantage for China is its own vast market This is why many American companies want the Trump administration to go only so far in its tussles with China applying enough pressure to free up more space for them to operate in China but not so much as to blow up their opportunities By one measure global firms look even more wedded to China despite the trade war: during the past 18 months the value of foreign mergers and acquisitions in China reached its highest in a decade according to Rhodium Group a research firm There have also been several high-profile investment projects BASF a German chemicals company is investing $10bn in a production complex in southern China to serve local customers Tesla opened its first foreign factory in Shanghai last year to cater to the Chinese market its biggest after AmericaAs is to be expected the global downturn is weighing heavily on Chinese manufacturers China exports fell by 8% in the first five months of 2020 compared with the same period a year earlier Yet Chinese firms are in better shape than most elsewhere thanks to the country success in slowing the spread of the coronavirus Not only is China economy one of the few likely to grow this year; its earlier resumption of industrial activity has allowed exporters to gain market share while most other countries are still in varying states of lockdown In Japan goods from China accounted for a record 30% of total imports in May In Europe they made up 24% of imports in April also a recordUnmade in ChinaYet this may be the high-water mark for China exporters Other countries are only too well aware of China manufacturing prowessand that it leaves them vulnerable to shortages of critical products That point hit home earlier this year as they scrambled to buy ventilators and masks from China Concern that too much manufacturing had been offshored to China motivated some members of the Trump administrationnotably Peter Navarro a brash White House adviserto impose tariffs on Chinese products A few years ago Mr Navarro obsessive focus on luring manufacturing back to America made him seem eccentric Now plenty of others sing the same tune if in gentler tones In April Japan earmarked $22bn to help defray the costs of manufacturers leaving China European officials have warned of excessive dependence on China especially for medical products From India to Taiwan governments are offering loans cheap land and other incentives to lure companies from ChinaSuch inducements have rarely worked in the past but they stand a better chance now Three factors are pushing firms to shift some manufacturing operations even as they continue to target the Chinese market for sales First China climb up the value chain and rising labour costs have squeezed out low-end firms Many garment-makers and basic electronic-assembly plants have already left typically for South-East Asia Second tensions between China and America have made companies wary of being caught on one side or the other Apple still makes most of its iPhones in China but to hedge its political risks has encouraged its suppliers to expand elsewhere such as India Third the rolling shutdowns of factories during the pandemic with China production almost entirely knocked out in February has underscored the danger of being over-exposed to any one countryEvidence of the shifting tide can be found in surveys of senior executives of big companies from America China and north Asia eg Japan and South Korea conducted by UBS a Swiss bank Among its 1000-plus respondents 76% of American companies 85% of north Asian ones and even 60% of Chinese firms said that they had already moved or were planning to move some production away from China Keith Parker of UBS estimates that companies might shift between 20-30% of their Chinese manufacturing capacity The relocations will not happen overnight but they will slowly chip away at China dominance in manufacturingIn the meantime Chinese businesses are resilient and retain a well-honed ability to adapt Take Sowind a maker of household-cleaning toolsone of the companies showing off its wares at the virtual Canton Fair Along with mainstays such as brooms and lint rollers it was flogging a new product: motion-activated battery-powered soap-dispensers for home use In a live-stream Ivy a young saleswoman in a Sowind red polo shirt tailored her pitch to the grim viral reality: “You don’t need to touch the soap dispenser so you can avoid cross-infections” Contacted after her broadcast Ivy said that customers in Europe and America were buying thousands at a time “Our clients really need this” she said As for the online migration of the world biggest trade show she was also upbeat “It takes time to get used to a new technique but it gone better than I had expected”

 Sep 7th 2021,A coup in Guinea adds fuel to aluminium red-hot rally,FEW MIGHT have guessed that Guinea a west African country of 13m people played a big role in global commodity markets In recent years the country has ramped up its production of bauxite a dirty-red ore that is processed to make aluminium thanks to hefty investment from China In 2020 Guinea produced around 90m tonnes of the stuff about a quarter of the global total up from 21m in 2015 It now supplies more than half the bauxite used in Chinese refineries And those refineries in turn produce more than half the world aluminiumListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSmall wonder then that the military coup that threw Guinea into turmoil on September 5th was felt in commodity markets Events in the country helped push the price of aluminium already on a tear to its highest level in ten years Guinea is also home to Simandou one of the world richest untapped deposits of iron ore Share prices in China Hongqiao and Rio Tinto two investors in Simandou briefly dipped when news of the coup brokeGuinea is only the latest factor behind the surging aluminium price So far this year it has shot up by around 40% see chart faster than that of any other highly traded metal One reason for the rally is growing demand Locked-down consumers drank more at home boosting demand for aluminium cans As economies have recovered from the deep covid-induced downturns of 2020 demand for aluminium for construction has picked up; plans to spend generously on infrastructure in America China and Europe should further bolster that demand And sales of electric vehicles which tend to contain a bit more aluminium than conventional cars have pushed up demand for the metal tooSupply constraints however have been more important In August a fire put a large refinery in Jamaica out of action Rio Tinto is trying to resolve a workers’ strike at a smelter in Canada Other disruptions stem from China Making aluminium uses a huge amount of energy some traders refer to the metal as “congealed electricity” New energy-consumption targets have led some provincial authorities such as those in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang to scale back production A drought in Yunnan meanwhile has hit the supply of hydropower Together these could lower Chinese annualised aluminium output by about 5% estimates Gregory Shearer of JPMorgan Chase a bankWhether the coup in Guinea will limit supply further is unclear So far mines in the country are still running ships are still being loaded with bauxite and warehouses in Chinese ports are well stocked But some analysts worry that other countries will impose sanctions on the new government or that the new regime itself will tax miners Either would disrupt the flow of bauxite out of GuineaEven then however bauxite is abundant enough for Chinese refineries to have other options This suggests that a bigger concern for the aluminium market is where Chinese regulations go next Authorities are already worried about soaring metals prices hurting Chinese manufacturers They have released some aluminium along with other metals from their strategic reserves to try to curb inflationThis objective bumps up against others One is the energy-consumption targets Another is a limit on China aluminium output set in 2017 when authorities thought the country was producing too much If Chinese refineries start to restrict production as they approach the threshold prices may rise until new capacity is built elsewhereOne possibility is that China starts to move aluminium production abroad to places where labour is cheapIndonesia for instance Some nickel production has already shifted to the country and China Hongqiao which is also the world largest aluminium producer recently said it would expand its refinery operations there Guinea new rulers may end up selling their bauxite to Indonesian firmswith China help of course For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Sep 4th 2021,Could climate change trigger a financial crisis?,IN RECENT YEARS regulators have begun warning about the threat that climate change poses to the stability of the financial system Following its strategy review in July the European Central Bank ECB will assemble a “climate change action plan” Mark Carney the former governor of the Bank of England warned of financial risks from climate change as long ago as 2015 In America the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last year published a 200-page report beginning “Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the US financial system” But progressive Democratic politicians are calling on President Joe Biden not to reappoint Jerome Powell as the chairman of the Federal Reserve partly because they think he has done too little to eliminate climate riskListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKJust how damaging does climate risk stand to be though? Early stress tests by central banks and disclosures of companies are starting to shed light on the question For the most part the evidence that it could bring down the financial system is underwhelming But a lot hangs on whether governments set out a clear path for reducing emissions such as through carbon taxes and energy-efficiency standards giving banks enough time to prepareClimate change can affect the financial system in three ways The first is through what regulators describe as “transition risks” These are most likely to arise if governments pursue tougher climate policies If they do the economy restructures: capital moves away from dirty sectors and towards cleaner ones Companies in polluting industries may default on loans or bonds; their share prices may collapseThe second channel is financial firms’ exposure to the hazards of rising temperatures Attributing individual natural disasters to climate change is tricky but the Financial Stability Board a group of regulators estimates that global economic losses resulting from weather-related catastrophes went from $214bn in the 1980s in 2019 prices to $162trn in the 2010s roughly trebling as a share of global GDP These losses are often borne by insurers though over time the costs should be passed on to customers through higher premiumsThe financial system could also be exposed to any wider economic damage caused by climate change say if it triggered swings in asset prices This third channel is harder to quantify Academic estimates of the effect of 3°C of warming relative to pre-industrial temperatures veer from financial losses of around 2% to 25% of world GDP according to the Network for Greening the Financial System a group of supervisors Even the gloomiest estimate might prove too rosy if climate change triggers conflicts or mass migrationsPerhaps the worst-case scenario for the financial system is where transition risks crystallise very suddenly and cause wider economic damage In 2015 Mr Carney described a possible “Minsky moment” named after Hyman Minsky an economist in which investors’ expectations about future climate policies adjust sharply causing fire sales of assets and a widespread repricing of risk That could spill over into higher borrowing costsThe value of financial assets exposed to transition risk is potentially very large According to Carbon Tracker a climate think-tank around $18trn of global equities $8trn of bonds and perhaps $30trn of unlisted debt are linked to high-emitting sectors of the economy That compares with the $1trn market for collateralised debt obligations CDOs in 2007 which were at the heart of the global financial crisis The impact of losses however would depend on who owns the assets Regulators might be especially concerned about the exposures of large “systemically important” banks and insurers for instancePreliminary stress tests conducted by central banks suggest that the impact of climate change on these sorts of institutions might be manageable In April the Banque de France BdF released the results from such an exercise It found that French banks’ exposures to transition risks were low Claims on insurers though did rise as a result of worse droughts and flooding by more than five times in some regionsIn a recent paper the ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board found similar results The exposures of euro-area banks and insurers to the highest-emitting sectors were “limited” although losses in a “hot-house world” scenario where temperatures rise by 35°C compared with pre-industrial times were more severe Still in both cases banks’ losses on their corporate loan books were only around half the level of those in the regular stress tests of euro-area lenders which they were deemed to be well-capitalised enough to passThose findings are consistent with an exercise by the Dutch central bank DNB in 2018 which found that the impact on Dutch financial firms from transition risks was “manageable” In its most severe scenario there was a sudden change in climate policy alongside rapid progress in renewable energy development causing a “double shock” for companies and a severe recession Even then banks’ capital ratios fell by about four percentage points That is sizeable but still less than what the banks experienced in this year regular stress tests by the European Banking Authority which they were deemed to passTo what extent are these stress tests realistic? Mark Campanale of Carbon Tracker is sceptical pointing out that most firms are using out-of-date models If auditors were ever to stress companies’ assets against a much lower oil price the associated write-downs could trigger a collapse in investor sentiment of the sort regulators fear he claims Nor do the stress tests include a full-blown Minsky crisisYet in other respects they are conservative Most of the tests used an accelerated time framefive years in the DNB and BdF casesin effect assuming that firms are stuck with the balance-sheets they have today But it seems reasonable to think that banks and insurers will change their business models as the climate transition progresses curbing the impact on the financial system The BdF ran a second exercise where firms were allowed to make realistic changes to their business models over 30 years Unsurprisingly that allowed banks to sharply reduce lending to fossil-fuel sectors and insurers to raise premiumsNonetheless the stress tests reveal the importance of giving firms time to adapt And that makes a predictable path for government policy important The BdF found that credit losses were highest when policy was delayed and there was a sudden transition Perhaps the most plausible scenario in which climate change affects financial stability is one in which governments dawdle and then have no choice but to take drastic action in the future For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 4th 2021,Sustainable investing faces the beginnings of a backlash,SINCE TIME immemorial the investment industry has sought to turn money into more money This is not a simple trick to pull offhence the rewards proffered to those who do it well The complexity of picking which assets to ownrich-world equities or poor-country bonds office blocks or orange-juice futurescontrasts with the simplicity of judging the success of those investments The winner put crudely is whoever snags the most marbles while taking the fewest risks That the money in question has helped build companies or kept governments ticking over seems almost incidental to the exerciseListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis approach is starting to feel old-hat More savers want a better idea of what their money gets up to What if their cash could be used both to generate a pension and improve the state of the world? “Sustainable” investment funds in the broadest sense managed $35trn of assets in 2020 reckons the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance an industry group up from $23trn in 2016 No issuer of shares or bonds can ignore virtuous investing Banks increasingly refuse to lend to firms with insufficiently impressive environmental social or governance ESG credentials Consultancies assessing whether bosses are doing their bit to combat climate change or social inequality have proliferatedSavers may bask in the feeling that their money is nudging capitalism in the right directionwhile still generating returns But the new approach is prompting the first signs of a backlash The answers to two uncomfortable questions remain elusive Are supposedly virtuous funds investing in appropriately virtuous companies? And is what these financial do-gooders are trying to pull off even such a good idea?Start with whether money purportedly chasing ESG-friendly investment is reaching the right targets Regulators have their doubts America Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has said it wants to crack down on “greenwashing” funds that flaunt their virtuous credentials but cannot prove that they have done the needed legwork when picking investmentsOn August 25th reports emerged that the SEC and its German counterpart were investigating whether DWS a large German asset manager that has boasted of its sustainable edge had misled customers about how much it used ESG metrics to place money This came after its former head of sustainability questioned claims that half of the fund assets were invested in ways that looked beyond mere profitThe firm denies wrongdoing But industry practitioners admit there are so many variants of sustainable investing that savers may well be confused Selecting firms to invest in often involves little more than a box-ticking exercise confirming that the right grade of recycled paper was used to publish the annual report A push to improve disclosure in Europethe place keenest on virtuous investingled funds defined as sustainable to contract by $2trn between 2018 and 2020Kinks around metrics may iron themselves out as the industry matures But that will not help with the second deeper critique: that investors chasing virtuousness are at best deluding themselves and at worst doing more harm than good That is the argument made by Tariq Fancy a former sustainable-investing bigwig at BlackRock in a blog post published on August 20th ESG investing he says merely “answers inconvenient truths with convenient fantasies”Mr Fancy points out that for all its trumpeting of virtue the investment industry is self-interested: keeping tabs on companies’ pledges to be better corporate citizens gives asset managers an opportunity to charge fatter fees And for every disgruntled investor selling a company stock he argues there is another to buy itEven if the new approach does tweak firms’ cost of capital by funnelling more investment to solar firms say and less to oil giants this merely promotes the dangerous illusion that business can lead the way on fighting say climate change or racism And if anything Mr Fancy thinks that pushes back the day when government action will actually take care of such problemsWhat does all this mean for savers and their pots of cash? Keeping tabs on what a company is up to is no bad thing but funds might need monitoring too Prioritising a CEO statements on Black Lives Matter over the viability of her investment plans is a recipe for poor returns and a flabby corporate sector And that would not so much nudge the capitalist model as derail itFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Sep 2nd 2021,The economy that covid-19 could not stop,HAVING IMPRESSED the world by taming the virus last year Vietnam is now in the middle of its worst outbreak of covid-19 by far Parts of the country are in strict lockdown and a swathe of factories from those making shoes for Nike to those producing smartphones for Samsung have either slowed or shut down disrupting global supply chains Yet integration with global manufacturing has kept Vietnam economy humming during the pandemic In 2020 GDP rose by 29% even as most countries recorded deep recessions Despite the latest outbreak this year could see even faster growth The World Bank latest forecasts published on August 24th point to an expansion of 48% in 2021Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis performance hints at the real reason to be impressed by Vietnam Its openness to trade and investment has made the country with GDP per capita of a mere $2800 an important link in supply chains And that in turn has powered a remarkable expansion It has been one of the five fastest-growing countries in the world over the past 30 years beating its neighbours hands down see chart 1 Its record has been characterised not by the fits and starts of many other frontier markets but by steady growth The government is even more ambitious wanting Vietnam to become a high-income country by 2045 a task that requires growing at 7% a year What is the secret to Vietnam successand can it be sustained?Vietnam is often compared to China in the 1990s or early 2000s and not without reason Both are communist countries that led by a one-party political system turned capitalist and focused on export-led growth But there are big differences too For a start even describing Vietnam as export-intensive does not do justice to just how much it sells abroad Its goods trade exceeds 200% of GDP Few economies except the most resource-rich countries or city states dominated by maritime trade are or have ever been so trade-intensiveIt is not just the level of exports but the nature of the exporters that makes Vietnam different from China Indeed its deep connection to global supply chains and high levels of foreign investment make it seem more like Singapore Since 1990 Vietnam has received average foreign-direct-investment inflows worth 6% of GDP each year more than twice the global leveland far more than China or South Korea have ever recorded over a sustained periodAs the rest of East Asia developed and wages there rose global manufacturers were lured by Vietnam low labour costs and stable exchange rate That fuelled an export boom In the past decade exports by domestic firms have risen by 137% while those by foreign-owned companies have surged by 422% see chart 2But the widening gap between foreign and domestic firms now poses a threat to Vietnam expansion It has become overwhelmingly dependent on investment and exports by foreign companies whereas domestic firms have underperformedForeign firms can continue to grow providing more employment and output Yet there are limits to how far they can drive Vietnam development The country will need a productive services sector As living standards rise it may become less attractive to foreign manufacturers and workers will need other opportunitiesPart of the drag on domestic enterprise comes from state-owned firms Their importance in overall activity and employment has shrunk see chart 3 But they still have an outsize effect on the economy through their preferential position in the banking system which lets them borrow cheaply Banks make up for that unproductive lending by charging other domestic firms higher rates Whereas foreign companies can easily access funding overseas the average interest rate on a medium- or long-term bank loan in Vietnamese dong ran to 1025% last year Research by academics for the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics also suggests that productivity gains in the five years after Vietnam joined the World Trade Organisation in 2007 would have been 40% higher without state-owned firmsTo fire up the private sector the government wants to nurture the equivalent of South Korea chaebol or Japan keiretsu sprawling corporate groups that operate in a variety of sectors The government is “trying to create national champions” says Le Hong Hiep a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and a former Vietnamese civil servantVingroup a dominant conglomerate is the most obvious candidate In VinPearl VinSchool and VinMec it has operations that spread across tourism education and health VinHomes its property arm is Vietnam largest listed private firm by market capitalisationThe group efforts to break into finished automotive production through VinFast its carmaker may become important for the economic development of a country that is usually known for intermediate manufacturing In July the company Fadil car which is based on the design for Opel Karl make became Vietnam best-selling model beating Toyota Vios VinFast has grand ambitions abroad too In July it announced that it had opened offices in America and Europe and intended to sell electric vehicles there by March 2022Fostering national champions while staying open to investment is not easy however VinFast benefits from a bevy of tax reductions including a large cut in corporation tax for its first 15 years of operation In August state media also reported that the government was considering reinstating a 50% reduction in registration fees for locally built cars that expired last yearBut the country membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and a range of other trade and investment deals means that it cannot offer preferential treatment to domestic producers It must extend support to foreign firms that make cars in Vietnam too By contrast China trade policy which prefers broad but shallow deals does not constrain domestic policy in quite the same wayVietnam may also hope to rely on another source of growth The economic boom has encouraged its enormous diaspora to invest or even to return home “There aren’t a lot of economies that are experiencing the sort of thing that Vietnam is” says Andy Ho of VinaCapital an investment firm with $37bn in assets His family moved to America in 1977 where he was educated and worked in consulting

that appears to be in the early stages of emulating an East Asian economic miracle But no country has become rich through remittances alone As Vietnam develops sustaining rapid growth from exports of

 Sep 2nd 2021,At the Jackson Hole meeting the Fed ponders an uneven recovery,BUSINESS CYCLES are never perfectly symmetric across time and space Yet they have rarely been as uneven as the rebound from covid-19 Some parts of the global economy are straining to meet roaring demand even as others limp along battered by the spread of the virus It is enough to take the fun out of monetary policy Indeed the Delta variant kept attendees of an annual symposium for central bankers from meeting in Jackson Hole Wyoming in the shadow of the majestic Teton mountains on August 27th Instead they peered at their computer screens as they discussed how to shepherd an unbalanced economy through uncertain timesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA pressing question loomed over the proceedings: just how and when to tighten policy given high inflation and lingering unemployment Tweaks to the Federal Reserve framework in recent years are meant to give it room to manage such difficult circumstances It now aims to hit its 2% inflation target on average and will court high inflation to make up for past shortfalls But surging prices are testing this approach Data released as the conference began showed that the Fed preferred measure of inflation had risen to 42% in July the highest in 30 years Jerome Powell the Fed chairman made no suggestion to his fellow participants that he would drastically change course and confirmed that the Fed might begin to taper asset purchases later in the year But policy he cautioned would have to change as new data come inResearch presented at the symposium offered guidance on how to cope with a lopsided recovery Veronica Guerrieri of the University of Chicago and her co-authors for instance considered how policymakers should respond when demand surges in some sectors and lags in others If there is little scope for workers to shift from unfavoured industries to the up-and-comers they write then the shift in demand acts like a “cost-push shock” similar to a spike in oil prices In such cases central banks typically accept some pain in the form of above-normal inflation and some in above-normal unemployment But if workers can move then there are benefits to central banks’ facilitating this shiftEasy money is not obviously the right answer If loose monetary policy raises demand for both booming and busting sectors then it might slow reallocation by propping up firms that ought really to close But the authors argue that in a world in which it is easy to adjust wages upward but tricky to cut them inflation may in fact hasten reallocation Because nominal wages in lagging industries cannot easily fall workers face little incentive to move to promising sectors Inflation though enables the real wage in lagging sectors to fall relative to that in booming ones encouraging workers to move Thus it makes sense in theory for monetary policy to have an inflationary bias during an uneven recoveryMr Powell would probably welcome that argument But if American firms continue to hire at the recent pace the unemployment rate may fall back to its pre-pandemic level of 35% by the end of 2022 That presents the Fed with a new dilemma While the unemployment rate has recovered quickly labour-force participation has not: of the drop experienced in early 2020 just under half has been clawed back; the unemployment rate by contrast is more than 80% of the way back Part of Mr Powell justification for the change in framework was the beneficial effects of tight labour markets which he reckoned would eventually draw workers from disadvantaged groups back into the labour force But the patience needed to allow such effects to unfold could vanish amid high inflation and low unemploymentWork presented by Bart Hobijn of Arizona State University and Aysegul Sahin of the University of Texas at Austin on the “participation cycle” affirms the benefits of patience It is not the case that workers from disadvantaged groups are more likely to drop out of the labour force during downturns and are only enticed back after sufficiently long recoveries Rather the probability that a worker drops out is much higher for unemployed workers than employed ones whatever their background It is thus the higher unemployment rates that disadvantaged groups tend to face that are responsible for their leaving the labour force And this effect begins reversing as soon as labour markets begin to recover Greater job stabilitythat is a higher chance of finding work and a lower chance of losing a jobreduces the flow of workers into unemployment and out of the labour force raising the participation rateThe effect is powerful; the authors estimate that a one-percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate tends to raise the participation rate by 065 percentage points other things equal The beneficial effect continues even after unemployment reaches a trough with the participation rate typically reaching a peak nine months later The upshot for policy is therefore broadly similar to where Mr Powell has ended up: a low unemployment rate need not imply that labour-market slack has run out or that patience on the part of the central bank will not eventually be rewardedWhen the odds are against youOther research reinforced the doveish mood pointing out the adverse effects on emerging markets of premature monetary tightening in the rich world But outside the conference Mr Powell has been bombarded by criticism of loose money Inflation has now more than made up its shortfall since 2015 let alone the start of the pandemic Some heads of regional Fed banks such as Raphael Bostic of Atlanta are eager to reverse quantitative easing soon Prominent economists such as Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago and Larry Summers of Harvard have highlighted the dangers of prolonging asset purchasesAcademia lags reality and there is little doubt that during the recovery from the global financial crisis the Fed overestimated the danger of inflation and undercounted the long-term benefits of driving unemployment lower The critics’ worry is that the central bank may now be overcompensating for that error Dig deeperFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe and AmericaAn early version of this article was published online on August 27th 2021

 Aug 28th 2021,Ending pandemic unemployment aid has not yielded extra jobsyet,ONE OF THE questions gripping America is the extent to which generous unemployment benefits are distorting the economy When covid-19 began to spread last year Congress expanded unemployment insurance UI by topping up payments allowing recipients to claim for longer and widening the eligibility criteria The aid helped preserve incomes during lockdowns and fuelled consumer spending during the recovery In March lawmakers extended federal funding for the benefits But it is due to expire on September 6thwith consequences that are uncertainListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOne possibility is that the cliff-edge will bring people back to work Although employment remains about 57m below its level in February 2020 firms are struggling to fill vacancies In July wages in leisure and hospitality jobs were nearly 10% above pre-pandemic levels Economic theory says that UI deters jobseekinga prediction supported at least to some degree by most studies of its effects before 2020Yet this relationship has not been apparent during the pandemic Congress allowed states to opt out of the prolonged benefits this year Over the summer 26 of themmostly those with Republican governorsended at least some benefits early Their economies do not seem to have benefited much Between June and July the share of working-age people who were employed rose by 35 percentage points in states that kept the benefits exceeding the 27-percentage-point increase in states that cut them offSeveral groups of researchers have struggled to unearth the expected correlation using more sophisticated methods The latest attempt is by Kyle Coombs of Columbia University and co-authors who studied the bank records of 18000 low-income workers They found that in the states that ended benefits 26% of workers who had previously received them were employed in August compared with 22% in other statesa difference that as a share of the entire labour force is modestThe Economist has conducted its own analysis The Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey HPS interviews tens of thousands of people each week about how the pandemic is affecting them One of the questions is whether respondents have worked in the past week We measured how the share of people aged 24-65 in each state who said they were working had changed since January Using a technique called “difference in differences” we compared average changes in reported employment rates in two groups of states those that ended benefits early and those that had not The numbers were virtually indistinguishable: in months when employment rose in cut-off states it climbed by a similar amount in other states The same was true when employment declinedThe absence of large effects does not mean that previous beliefs about UI were wrong The pandemic is a highly unusual period for the economy meaning the effects of benefit cut-offs could take longer to appear By making jobseekers choosier higher UI may be boosting wages instead of limiting the employment recoverywhich might sound desirable but could be inflationary In cut-off states the earnings of drivers on ride-hailing apps which respond in real time to labour supply and have been falling lately have declined by about 10% more than in other states reckon economists at Goldman Sachs a bank The nationwide cut-off in September should they say increase labour supply and slow the pace of wage growthOne consequence of withdrawing benefits might not come as a surprise It has left the jobless with less money in their pockets Mr Coombs and his colleagues found that in cut-off states affected workers reduced their weekly outlays by $278 Our analysis of the HPS shows that the share of adults saying it was “somewhat” or “very” difficult to pay for typical household expenses began rising in cut-off states shortly before the expiry Elsewhere there was no change see chartThat raises the possibility that cutting off benefits could harm overall consumer spending But the numbers involved are puny: a $2bn fall between June and early August compared with monthly aggregate consumer spending of over $13trn The labour-supply effect should be more significantif it shows up For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

The party has clarified what it does not entail: it does not imply that everyone will end up enjoying equal prosperity Entrepreneurs who create their own wealth “work hard with integrity and have the guts to start their own businesses” should be encouraged Nor will the egalitarian turn be abrupt It should be pursued “step by step” in a “gradual” manner the commission reiterated this monthBut the goal also rules out a continuation of the status quo “We must not allow the gap between rich and poor to get wider” Mr Xi insisted in January People in the top fifth of Chinese households enjoy a disposable income more than ten times as high as people in the bottom fifth according to official figures Disposable incomes in cities are two and a half times as high as in the countryside And the top 1% own 306% of household wealth according to Credit Suisse a bank compared with 314% in AmericaUnfortunately defining what will count as common prosperity is complicated by the sheer volume and variety of aspirations and exhortations that often follow in the term trail aspirations that could be laudable or lamentable depending on details that have yet to be formulated let alone divulgedCommon prosperity will require a stronger safety-net for the unfortunate better pensions more equal access to public services including education and health It will result in an “olive-shaped” distribution of income that is fat in the middle but thin at the bottom and top China has about 400m people living on incomes between 100000 and 500000 yuan roughly $15000-77000 for a family of three or the equivalent It wants to double that number to 800m people in about a decade according to the Development Research Centre a think-tank attached to China State Council The party says it will increase the role of taxation in fighting inequality It will adjust high incomes “reasonably” But it has yet to quantify that reasonableness by specifying future tax rates or thresholds Besides the government overhauled personal taxes as recently as 2018 making it unlikely to have another go soon according to Gabriel Wildau of Teneo a risk-advisory firm A crackdown on tax evasion and illicit income is more likely This week the party corruption watchdog said it had instructed over 24800 party cadres in the city of Hangzhou to undertake “self-examination” and confess to any illegal borrowing from local firms or other conflicts of interestMost egalitarian governments content themselves with tweaking taxes and transfers But China reach is broader It is also championing two other kinds of redistribution: “voluntary” donations by the rich Tencent an internet giant ploughed $77bn into its social initiatives soon after the August 17th meeting and what is sometimes called “pre-distribution” This can entail altering the split of national income between wages and profits A common prosperity “demonstration zone” in Zhejiang province for example includes a target to raise labour share of the province income from 478% in 2017 to over 50%The labour share is not easy to measure let alone manipulate It has declined steadily in many developed economies thanks to deep forces like globalisation and technological change But China wage-earners might benefit from policies like the government new guidelines on gig workers which seek to improve their wages and bargaining position Certainly investors in the gig economy fear these policies will leave a smaller slice of the cake for them The share price of Meituan a food-delivery giant has fallen by 18% since the guidelines were released As with many of its signature initiatives the party will not impose a common approach to common prosperity “Local authorities will be encouraged to explore effective ways that suit local conditions” it said on August 17th Cities in Zhejiang are scrambling to add the label to various initiatives from narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas to promoting the “spiritual” riches of the populace Over time the successful projects will be said to conform to Mr Xi vision; in reality his vision will coalesce around themJust because common prosperity remains nebulous does not however mean it is vacuous “Achieving common prosperity is not only an economic issue but also a significant political issue” Mr Xi said in January The party hopes that reviving this ancient ideal will help strengthen the foundations of its rule Confucius again got there first “Where there is contentment” the sage says “there will be no upheavals”For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 28th 2021,The new Powell doctrine,NO ONE CAN accuse him of inconsistency Over the past year Jerome Powell chairman of the Federal Reserve has again and again used the same phrasing to kick off his press conferences after it sets interest rates “Good afternoon At the Federal Reserve we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary-policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability” It may not set pulses racing But that is just how Mr Powell wants it: a projection of control in terms any schoolchild can understandListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe simple wording belies a remarkable evolution in Fed policy and practice on his watch Mr Powell has overseen a giant monetary response to the covid-induced slowdown The Fed has bought more than $4trn in assets during the pandemic equivalent to 18% of GDP dwarfing the scale of its actions after the global financial crisis and swelling its total balance-sheet to $83trn see chart 1 Mr Powell has refined the way the Fed communicates targeting his messages at ordinary Americans rather than economists He has led a landmark shift in the way it thinks about interest rates And in the process he has presided over a bold gamble keeping policy ultra-loose even as inflation soars To his supportersof whom there are manyhe saved America from an economic catastrophe To his critics however he is steering it into dangerThese days much of the conversation about Mr Powell focuses on whether President Joe Biden will reappoint him His four-year term as chairman ends in February 2022 Mr Biden is expected to announce in the coming weeks whether he will renew Mr Powell term or nominate a replacement giving markets time to brace for the change if there is one Progressives within the Democratic Party accuse Mr Powell of slowly dismantling rules intended to make the financial system safer and would prefer a chairperson who is tougher on banks Lael Brainard the lone Fed governor who has consistently opposed moves to for instance soften lenders’ leverage limits is their favoured candidateStill most Fed watchers expect Mr Powell to get a second term Betting markets assign it an 85% probability Most Democrats and Republicans think he has done a good job in tough times The economy is recovering and stocks are near all-time highs Why rock the boat? The politics would look good too Mr Biden would re-establish a precedent broken by President Donald Trump of reappointing Fed chiefs first chosen by a president from another party It would also make sense to anyone tracing the arc of Mr Powell leadership Over the past four years he placed his big bets The test of whether he was right or rash will come in the next fourAn assessment of Mr Powell record can be divided into three periods The first was before the pandemic His most notable achievement was arguably political The central bank faced the gravest challenge to its independence in decades when Mr Trump railed against its interest-rate rises Mr Powell stuck to the Fed agenda and patiently explained that the president had no authority to fire him but otherwise refused to get drawn into a war of words Mr Powell also displayed intellectual flexibility When inflation dipped in 2019 the central bank swiftly reversed gear and began cutting interest ratesand held them low even as unemployment declined to levels that economists had assumed might lead to upward price pressures “He let the economy push farther and farther than anyone thought it could go” says Jason Furman an economic adviser to President Barack ObamaThe second period came with the onset of the pandemic As the economy came to a sudden stop in March 2020 stocks plunged and credit markets seized up Mr Powell wasted no time in engineering a massive rescue slashing rates to zero and buying up a wide range of assetsnot just Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities but also for the first time corporate bonds Within three months the Fed asset holdings had increased by $3trnThe third period of Mr Powell tenure unfolding now is the most contentious Many who applauded the Fed stimulus during the depths of the pandemic think the central bank should have started rolling it back Monthly asset purchases of $120bn make little sense and indeed may be storing up trouble when inflation is running above 5% Move too slowly to unwind and financial markets could overheat some prominent investors such as Jeremy Grantham argue that they are already red-hot Move too quickly and a market crash would be a self-fulfilling prophecy rippling through the global economy Sonal Desai of Franklin Templeton an asset manager calls it the “hardest high-wire balancing act we’ve seen in a long time”Priced to perfection?Mr Powell is trying to pull it off by giving markets plenty of warning in the hope of avoiding a repeat of the “taper tantrum” that spooked markets in 2013 He is due to speak at an annual Fed jamboreeusually held in Jackson Hole Wyoming but being conducted online because of covid-19on August 27th after The Economist goes to press when he is expected to say that a tapering of asset purchases could start later in the year Many observers expect a three-step shift: a pre-announcement at the central bank rate-setting meeting in September that a tapering announcement will come at its November meeting followed in December by actual taperingGuesses about the tapering schedule though are only one element of the debate now swirling around Mr Powell agenda Last year he introduced a new framework for monetary policy building on a shift that started under his predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke announcing that the Fed would target an average of 2% inflation over the longer run while also seeking to let the economy reach full employment He has also pledged that the Fed will not raise rates until inflation is at 2% and is forecast to stay above it for some time Tapering can begin earlier as long as there is “substantial further progress”a deliberately vague phrasetowards meeting the inflation and employment targets What he could not have foreseen was the extremely uneven recovery from the pandemic with prices climbing but the unemployment rate still nearly two percentage points higher than at the start of 2020“The Fed has tied its hands to be quite late to remove monetary-policy accommodation” says William Dudley former president of the New York Fed Mr Dudley thinks that the Fed new framework is correct but worries that the implementation has been too rigid He says that he would have argued for less extreme conditions to taper or to raise interest rates Mr Furman warns that Mr Powell could be paving the way for unpredictable policy which would give rise to the very market shocks he has wanted to avoid “There been a bit of assuming that everything going to work out exactly right and not having much public communication about what will happen if it doesn’t” he saysYet many other economists and Fed veterans support Mr Powell approach The average-inflation framework was designed with the broader backdrop in mind: steadily lower inflation was keeping interest rates low and limiting the Fed monetary space Covid-19 though an extreme challenge is unlikely to alter these long-standing structural forces Much of the recent surge in inflation appears to stem from ephemeral factors such as gummed-up supply chains David Wilcox a former research director at the Fed says that as long as inflation expectations remain anchored at 2% the Fed is likely to wait it out “In that context an abrupt move to tighten could be a costly mistake” he arguesIf inflation persists and filters into wages a year or so from now that would be a different storybut a modest overshoot would not necessarily be an unwelcome one “If inflation runs to the upside that a problem they want to have and they have the tools for dealing with it” says Alan Levenson of T Rowe Price an asset manager As it stands the central forecast of members of the Fed rate-setting committee is for inflation to return to roughly 2% next year Market pricing of Treasury bonds points to much the same outcomeFor all the controversy about Mr Powell monetary policy it is his approach to financial regulation that has been the biggest lightning-rod for his political opponents especially progressive Democrats “I see one move after another to weaken regulation over Wall Street banks” Senator Elizabeth Warren said at hearings in July Defenders of Mr Powell say that such a characterisation is unfair The Fed did for instance scrap pandemic-era limits on most banks’ stock buybacks and dividend payments at the end of June but that was only after subjecting them to three stress tests to confirm that they had more than enough capital In other areas the Fed under Mr Powell has been strict In March it rebuffed banks’ requests to extend an exemption on leverage caps that had helped them during last year slowdownIf Mr Biden wants to keep Mr Powell in his job while signalling a tougher stance on regulation he has an obvious solution Randal Quarles term as the Fed vice-chairman responsible for banking supervision ends in October see chart 2 Instead of nominating Ms Brainard as chairwoman he could choose her to replace Mr Quarles For markets such a reshuffle would minimise the turbulence from changing Fed chiefs at a critical juncture Politically it would be deft And it would give Mr Powell a chance to answer the fundamental question posed by his policies: whether the great monetary loosening so necessary last year can be unwound without doing great harm to the economy For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and

 Aug 28th 2021,Out of Bill Ackman SPAC woes comes innovation,IN THE CLASSIC 1980s arcade game Pac-Man is pursued by killer ghosts as he attempts to achieve his goal of gobbling up little dots These colourful ghosts have various tactics to scupper Pac-Man: “Blinky” the red one gives chase; “Pinky” and “Inky” the pink and the blue spooks obstruct his path and attempt to corner himListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBill Ackman a hedge-fund tycoon turned sponsor of a “special-purpose acquisition company” SPAC has become a financial Pac-Man of sorts The goal of a SPAC is to gobble up a private company and take it public It raises capital from investors that is held in a listed vehicle while it seeks a merger target In July last year Mr Ackman raised $4bn for Pershing Square Tontine Holdings making it by far the biggest SPAC created But he has been pursued by a bevy of ghostsFirst came Pinky and Inky the obstructors For most Wall Street endeavours the more capital the better but for SPACs too much cash can complicate matters They typically take a minority stake in a private firm so a big fund must limit itself to the tiny pool of such firms worth tens of billions of dollars After months of searching Mr Ackman tried to strike a deal in June to buy shares in Universal Media Group a subsidiary being carved out of Vivendi a listed entertainment conglomerate based in Paris This was an unusual use of SPAC capital: it would spend only some of the vehicle funds and planned to buy shares in a firm that was already going public The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC America markets regulator objected to the deal leading Mr Ackman to write to investors on July 19th that he would no longer pursue itNext came Blinky the hunter On August 17th George Assad a shareholder in the SPAC sued it alleging that it was actually an investment fund which must be registered with the SEC and abide by all kinds of rules The claim is that the only activities the SPAC has ever undertaken are investing in securities and equities namely Treasuries and the attempt to buy shares in the process of being listedthe terrain of investment fundsMr Ackman SPAC is a particularly good target for this complaint even though its bid to buy shares in Universal Music Group eventually failed But the argument could apply to SPACs in general: all hold their assets in Treasuries from their inception until they consummate a merger If successful the suit would probably require SPACs to be registered as investment funds Given the resulting onerous disclosure requirements and fee caps this could kill SPACs altogetherWhether the lawsuit will succeed is unclear The SEC has treated SPACs as distinct from investment funds for decades Writing to investors on August 19th Mr Ackman argued that the lawsuit was “meritless” But it may have spelled game over for his SPAC regardless SPACs have just two years to find a merger target and Mr Ackman wrote “the mere existence of the litigation may deter potential merger partners” He announced that he plans to dissolve his SPAC and return the capital raisedYet Mr Ackman is not defeated In June he filed a registration for a new gambit: a “SPARC” or special-purpose acquisition rights company This is like a SPAC but without the pot of capital Rather than issuing shares at $10 or $20 a pop to raise a pot of money that is invested in Treasuries while the sponsor hunts for a target he plans to distribute the right to buy shares at $20 once a deal is announced Once he liquidates his SPAC and returns the capital to shareholders he plans to distribute free SPARC rights to them insteadThe new structure still requires regulators’ consent But in many ways it could be more efficient It eliminates the opportunity cost of locking up investors’ funds for two years Shareholders can still approve or reject a deal: whereas with SPACs they can opt out by claiming their money back or voting against the merger with SPARCs they opt in Playing SPACman may not have been fun any more but Mr Ackman has moved on to a new game Correction September 1st 2021: An earlier version of this article said that Pershing Square Tontine Holdings planned to buy shares in Universal Music Group after the group listed In fact the SPAC planned to buy the shares beforehand and distribute them to shareholders after the listing was complete SorryFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 21st 2021,Emerging-market policymakers grapple with rising inflation,IT HAS BEEN a long few months for the emerging world Punishing temperaturesJuly was the hottest month on record worldwide according to a recent analysisfanned fires on Turkey Mediterranean shores and scorched Russia wheat fields Covid-19 rages across countries with low vaccination rates Just 24% of Brazilians 9% of Indians and 7% of South Africans are double-jabbed On top of everything else inflation is running hot tooListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSoaring food and energy prices have pushed inflation to uncomfortably high levels In Brazil consumer prices are 9% higher than they were a year ago see chart more than twice the central bank target In Russia inflation is 65% well above the central bank aim of 4% Inflation in India which had been high in 2020 rose above 6% this summernorth of the Reserve Bank target range Policymakers in poorer countries have navigated a fraught path this year The outbreak of high prices lays another severe test at their feetGrowth has mostly resumed despite the continued ravages of covid-19 In parts of the emerging world such as India output has already regained its pre-pandemic level In others such as Russia it is expected to do so by the end of the year Soaring prices for oil metals and agricultural products have been a boon for commodity exporters But recoveries have been frustratingly uneven Better times for export industries have not always translated into broader labour-market recovery Business is booming in Brazil mining towns for instance but the unemployment rate across the country at 146% has scarcely declined from its pandemic peakThat in turn has placed pressure on governments to extend or even increase spending on relief programmes Economic growth is boosting tax revenues in many countries improving the public finances that were battered by covid-19 Still fiscal deficits remain large A decision in June to expand grain handouts means that India central government is likely to borrow more than the 68% of GDP expected in the budget for the 2022 fiscal year Brazil which borrowed an eye-watering 134% of GDP last year has extended its emergency cash transfers Chile and Colombia which limited their borrowing to a modest 7% of GDP in 2020 last year are planning to borrow about as much or more this year according to the Institute of International Finance a bankers’ groupWhen you combine more money flowing through the economy with supply disruptions though the result is inflationary pressure Emerging-market central bankers like their rich-world counterparts argue that high inflation is merely temporary But unlike their advanced-economy peers some have not felt comfortable enough to wait and see They have more recent experience of bouts of high inflation and doubt that public expectations of low inflation are as firmly anchored as in rich countries They have thus moved forcefully to rein in inflation Brazil central bank raised interest rates by a full percentage point on August 4th on top of three increases of 075 percentage points each since March The Central Bank of Russia also announced a full-point rise on July 23rd also its fourth of the year Mexico and Peru raised interest rates on August 12th Other central banks that have held fire are expected to tighten in coming monthsThis determination to curb inflation may have kept foreign investors interested Early this year some economists worried that a roaring recovery in America and the prospect of higher interest rates there could lead to a rush of money out of emerging economies: an echo of the “taper tantrum” of 2013 when the Federal Reserve began normalising monetary policy after the financial crisis An uptick in American Treasury yields in February and March this year was accompanied by a slowdown in portfolio flows to emerging markets seemingly presaging worse to comeThat has not materialised however and not only because Treasury yields have dropped back from their spring highs It also reflects a more robust policy framework in emerging economies and greater resilience to market swings In recent decades they have built up foreign-exchange reserves and limited their dependence on foreign-currency debt Most survived a severe squeeze in March 2020 when panicked investors rushed to havens and emerging markets’ currencies tumbled with minimal economic damageBy comparison recent exchange-rate wobbles have been modest which has limited the extent to which higher import prices add to inflationary pressure So far this year the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee have weakened against the dollar by about 2% The real sank by nearly a quarter last year and by about 20% during the ructions of 2013 Vigilant central banks probably helped keep investors from growing skittishBut higher interest rates are tough medicine at home Large increases pose a risk to growth Slower growth in turn hurts the public coffers even as higher interest rates raise governments’ borrowing costs Among the large emerging economies the risk of a crisis is perhaps most palpable in Brazil where a loss of confidence in the public finances contributed to a deep recession in 2015 and 2016 If the fiscal risk premium that bond-buyers demand continues to rise then the government may soon face a terrible choice between slashing spending while unemployment remains high and a full-blown fiscal crisis Indeed on August 12th Roberto Campos Neto the head of Brazil central bank fretted that markets were beginning to perceive a “fiscal deterioration” that could jeopardise economic recoveryRecent woes only make the inflation problem starkerand at risk of spilling over to other countries A severe drought in Brazil has reduced the capacity of its hydroelectric plants and sent energy prices soaring It also threatens the production of export crops like coffee leading to reduced supplies and higher prices Low levels of the Paraná river have forced firms like Vale a mining company to reduce the loads of iron ore being carried on barges causing global shortages Russia government is taxing wheat shipments abroad contributing to higher prices worldwideThe fever could break later in the year as bottlenecks ease and as demand from America and China cools a little Yet there is also a risk of new disruptions: fresh outbreaks of covid-19 more natural disasters or social unrest perhaps related to higher food prices And for exporters like Brazil softer commodity prices bring their own problems such as a tumbling currency and an economic slowdown A turn for the worse in one country could sour investor sentiment towards other places Emerging markets have handled the economic strains of the past 18 months with fortitude But a break in the heat cannot come soon enough For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly

 Aug 21st 2021,Just how mighty are active retail traders?,JUST TWO years ago the future of investing seemed to involve fewer and fewer people Retail investors were piling into “passive” index funds which track a broad basket of stocks for a tiny fee Active fund managers whether swaggering hedge-fund gurus or staid mutual-fund bosses were in retreat as index and quantitative funds swelled More automation seemed inevitable A future in which human investors vanished altogether replaced by slick powerful machines swapping shares at near-lightspeed seemed just around the cornerListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat is not quite how things have turned out A mass of active retail traders have been romping around the American stockmarket for more than a year They piled into short-dated derivative bets on Tesla an electric-vehicle maker and bid up shares in Hertz a car-rental firm after it went bankrupt Early this year came their pièce de résistance: a frantic rally in the shares of GameStop a video-game retailer which rose by 2000% in a little over two weeks So volatile was the share price and so large the flows that the stock-settlement system nearly brokeThe proximate causes for the retail renaissance are hard to disentangle Lockdown-induced boredom and stimulus cheques are often cited as fuel for the active retail investor But the pandemic swiftly followed a price war in October 2019 when America largest brokers all cut commissions to zero copying Robinhood a digital upstart And retail access to sophisticated trading tools such as leverage and derivatives has long been growing Between October 2019 and February 2020 trading volumes at retail brokers almost doubled from a low level before doubling again once lockdowns beganAlmost two years on from the price war it is clearly much more fashionable to be obsessed by the stockmarket and hang out on Reddit swapping tips than it is to be coolly indifferent But how big has the shift towards active retail trading really been? Is passive now passé?These questions can be answered in three ways The first is by examining the number of retail traders In 2019 around 59m Americans had accounts with one of seven of the largest brokers This number has surged since to 95m as 17m new accounts were opened in 2020 and 20m were set up this yearNext consider trading flows These suggest an almighty spike Retail trading went from around a quarter of volumes to a third in early 2020 and peaked at over 40% in the first quarter of 2021 once marketmakers who stand in the middle of every trade are excluded The plurality of trading activity now comes from retail punters not institutions quants or banksThird look at asset holdings According to Goldman Sachs a bank the share of American stocks held directly by households has been falling for decades as investing has become dominated by professionals In the 1970s and 1980s pension funds rose to prominence before active mutual funds gained market share in the 1990s and 2000s Over the past decade passive funds have gobbled up assets But the share held by households directly began to stabilise around 2015 and is climbing again: between the end of 2019 and March 2021 the share of stocks held by households climbed from 36% to 38%All this makes the active retail surge seem vast But two things should give you pause First the rise of the active retail investor has not derailed growth in passive ones Though the total slice of equities passively tracking an index is hard to measure the share of the S&P 500 held in exchange-traded and mutual index funds has risen by around 05 percentage points since 2019 to 183% That is slower than in preceding years but still a relentless march upwardsFurthermore not everyone who has opened a brokerage account since 2019 is a day-trader On average the 32m account holders at Charles Schwab which recently merged with TD Ameritrade trade around four times a month This is more active than Vanguard customers who seem positively idle three-quarters of them do not trade at all in a year but leisurely compared with the 34 or so trades that the 15m customers of Interactive Brokers another retail broker make every monthActive retail traders then are clearly a force to be reckoned with And if their ascent was prompted by the structural changes to access to trading rather than a passing pandemic fad then they will remain so Yet it is worth remembering that most retail investors still trade at a sedate paceFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Aug 21st 2021,The case for mutual educational disarmament,ECONOMISTS TEND to be big fans of education which is perhaps not surprising given how much of it they consume and how well their textbooks can do Alfred Marshall writing in 1873 hoped that education would help erase the “distinction between working men and gentlemen” Gary Becker of the University of Chicago reimagined education as an investment in “human capital” that would earn a return in the market much like other assets Harvard University Greg Mankiw whose books have educated more than most once calculated that differences in human capital between countries could account for much of their otherwise inexplicable differences in prosperityListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBut economics can also be scathing about schooling The theory of signalling likens many educational credentials to peacock tails: costly encumbrances useful only as conspicuous proof that their owners are intellectually strong enough to bear them And in “The Social Limits to Growth” a book published in 1976 Fred Hirsch once a writer for this newspaper pointed out that education is often “positional” in nature What matters is not only how much you have but whether you have more than the next person For many students it is not enough merely to acquire a good education They must obtain a better education than the people jostling with them in the queue for sought-after jobsPositional goods are by their nature in strictly limited supply Everyone can in principle live in a good neighbourhood attend a good school and work in a good job But logic sadly dictates that not everyone can enjoy the nicest neighbourhoods best schools or most prestigious jobs As Hirsch pointed out “what each of us can achieve all cannot”An unhappy corollary is that one family outlays on schooling raise the bar for everyone else Families are drawn often unwittingly into educational arms races They spend money and time on after-school tutoring or extra-curricular activities so-called shadow education in the expectation that it will improve their child position in the queue for advancement But they quickly discover that everyone else is doing the same leaving them in the same position as before They are in fact worse off because of the costs and frustration incurred “If everyone stands on tiptoe no one sees better” Hirsch noted And their feet also hurtThese arms races are often particularly ferocious in East Asia In China and South Korea schoolchildren face nationwide “high-stakes” teststhe gaokao in China and the suneung in South Koreathat play a big role in determining whether and where they can go to university In China cities pupils spent 106 hours a week on after-school tutoring according to a report by Frost & Sullivan a market-research firmThe governments in both countries have tried to orchestrate a kind of collective disarmament South Korea imposed a 10pm curfew on cramming schools in 2009 Inspectors would go on patrol looking for schools with their lights on Some schools covered their windows with black tape China has been introducing restrictions on after-school tutoring at an increasing pace since 2018 Last month it barred tutoring firms from listing on the stockmarket raising foreign capital or making a profit The strictures have wiped tens of billions of dollars off the market value of China once-booming edtech sectorWill these measures work? It is almost impossible to stop families hiring private tutors to teach their children in their own homes And if shadow education is successfully curtailed the arms race can take different forms Parents who cannot buy a better education directly can instead buy homes near better schools A study by Xuejuan Su of the University of Alberta and Huayi Yu of Renmin University found that when the management of a public elementary school in Beijing is taken over by another better-regarded school property prices nearby rise by an average of 7%The arms race is notably less intense in parts of Europe In Norway and Sweden parents show little demand for tutoringthe wealthy even less than others according to Steve Entrich of the University of Potsdam And overeducation is less common in Germany and other countries that sort children early into academic or vocational schools with little mobility between the two according to a study by Valentina Di Stasio of Utrecht University together with Thijs Bol and Herman Van de Werfhorst of the University of Amsterdam Vocational schools are supposed to teach what employers want recruits to know That may limit the scope for credential inflation For better or worse they also remove large numbers of students from the race for more academic laurelsBeruf als PolitikBoth China and South Korea have begun promoting vocational education China latest five-year plan which concludes in 2025 promises to explore an “apprenticeship system with Chinese characteristics” and to “vigorously cultivate talents with technical skills” according to one translation Some of the edtech firms squeezed out of after-school tutoring are exploring vocational education insteadGermany custom of placing children on different tracks at age ten or 11 also invites an interesting thought experiment What if the gaokao and similar tests were held earlier in a pupil career? If these exams truly test the knowledge required for university they must be held just before university starts But if such tests mostly serve as filters sifting better students from worse they need not be held so late An aptitude test at 16 years of age say will probably generate a similar ranking as one held two years later The tests would remain stressful But an earlier gaokao would save families a year or two of costly cramming shortening “the obstacle course” as Hirsch put it without much changing the results Such tests will always have high stakes But they need not require such high effort For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

our audio articles as you multitaskOKTRADE HAS flowed through the port of Ningbo on China east coast since the Tang Dynasty in the 8th century After the first opium war ended in 1842 it was one of five points of entry forcibly opened to foreign merchants And in the first half of this year the port which merged with neighbouring Zhoushan port in 2015 handled more tonnes of cargo than anywhere else in the world A tour group of 80 students recently spent three days admiring the free-trade zone and the port “hardcore” power as Ningbo city government put itBut on August 11th activity at one of the port busiest terminals came to an abrupt halt A 34-year-old dockworker who had come into contact with visiting crews was diagnosed with the Delta variant of covid-19 despite having received two shots of the Sinovac vaccine That solitary infection was all it took for the government to shut down operations and consign 254 of his close contacts and a further 396 of their contacts to quarantineThe case is revealing in three ways It illustrates once more how hard it is to keep the Delta variant at bay It demonstrates how hard China will yet again nonetheless try to do just that And it shows how widely around the world this struggle will be felt The terminal shutdown follows a similar closure at Yantian port on China south coast in May as well as disruptions wrought by last month typhoon In-Fa It now takes about 70 days for ocean freight to travel from its point of origin in China to its final destination in America compared with 47 last August according to Freightos a digital freight marketplace Some experts worry that the shipping delays and the prospect of future shutdowns may even disrupt the West Christmas shoppingThe port infection is part of an outbreak that was first discovered on July 20th at Nanjing airport By August 10th it had spread across a dozen provinces Unlike other countries which are learning to live with Delta China has imposed a hardcore combination of widespread testing and uncompromising quarantines Anyone who tests positive is whisked to hospital even if they are free of symptoms Anyone judged to have come into close contact with them based on mobile-phone data and other indicators is quarantined as are close contacts of these contacts By August 10th China had quarantined 50808 people more than 20 for every active confirmed case The government has discouraged inessential travel between cities and provinces And two of the worst-hit cities Nanjing and Zhengzhou have postponed the start of the school year According to a gauge of lockdowns devised by Goldman Sachs a bank China restrictions are now as tight as they were in April 2020The impact of the restrictions is already showing up in high-frequency data Airports were operating at only 38% of their capacity on August 12th according to Flight Master an online-travel platform And the median amount of traffic congestion in the 12 cities most affected by the outbreak has fallen 12% below its pre-pandemic norm according to Ernan Cui of Gavekal Dragonomics a research firmThis immobilisation will add to an economic slowdown that was already under way Industrial production retail sales investment and property sales were all weaker than expected in July see chart partly because the government is trying to curb steelmaking to preserve the environment and housing speculation to preserve financial stability Ting Lu of Nomura another bank expects GDP to be only 03% higher this quarter than last He has cut his forecast for growth this year from 89% to 82% which might warrant further easing from China central bank even as housing curbs remainChina slowdown is moving financial markets at homethe CSI300 index of large Chinese stocks has fallen by 4% since August 10thand worldwide The price of iron ore has slumped by 21% since the end of last month and the price of copper has fallen by more than 5% China tough stance will also prevent any revival of travel to other countries That is bad news for places like Thailand which relied on Chinese visitors for almost 30% of its tourist receipts before the pandemicChina fight against Delta will be costly But it is also proving successful New local infections excluding imported cases dropped to just six on August 16th The outbreak has started to narrow in scope as well as scale: 134 neighbourhoods still remain at risk by the government‘s reckoning down from 224 on August 10thChina has both an unusual ability to contain Delta outbreaks and a strong incentive to do so It lacks two of the characteristics that have allowed other countries to tolerate an otherwise disturbing rate of Delta infections Relatively few of China people have caught covid-19 in the past As a consequence few have any natural immunity to the disease And although a respectable percentage of the population have received two jabs over 55% according to the government China vaccines appear less effective than Western versions The share of China population that enjoys some kind of immunity is lower than India or even Indonesia according to Goldman Sachs even though its vaccination rate is far higher If China were to drop its defences and tolerate the infection rates common in Europe and America the number of people suffering from severe illness could rise to alarming levelsChina is unusually good at fighting Delta And it needs to be Having failed to fail against previous waves of the disease it is now obliged to succeed againFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business

 Aug 14th 2021,India consigns its tax time-machine to the past,WHEN INDIA introduced a retroactive tax on the sale of shares in foreign companies with domestic assets in 2012 the measure was reviled by foreign businesses and decried by the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP then in opposition as “tax terrorism” So foreign investors had reason to cheer on August 5th when the BJP government said it would repeal the law The reversal illustrates the tug-of-war the country has long facedbetween wanting to invite foreign investment into the country and resenting the legal tussles it bringsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe immediate reason for the repeal reflects the government desire to save itself from embarrassment overseas rather than a dramatic conversion to an open approach to foreign investment The tax law has led to legal headaches at home and abroad Two big companies have successfully disputed their retrospective bills in international courts but the government has not complied with the rulings leading one of them to take some drastic stepsIn July Cairn Energy a British oil and gas firm obtained a French court order to freeze several Indian government properties in Paris in pursuit of an arbitration award of $12bn plus interest and costs made in The Hague last year The relevant transactions date to a reorganisation of Cairn Indian assets made in 2006 and the sale of a majority stake to a mining firm in 2011 Cairnis also chasing Air India the country state-owned flag-carrier in American courts in pursuit of its awardThe government also found itself wrong-footed in a long-running dispute with Vodafone a mobile-phone company which won an arbitration award in The Hague last year The disputed transaction relates to its purchase in 2007 of Hutchison Essar an Indian phone network the row over which led India to introduce the retroactive-tax law in the first place The repeal of the tax offers the government a way to end such legal tussles without facing the indignity of a company repossessing its assets around the worldThe change in law throws a light on the government strained relationship with foreign investors’ rights more broadly A mistrust of international courts as a means of solving disputes over tax over which the country asserts sovereign rights has run through successive Indian governmentsIn 2015 the country adopted a new template for its bilateral investment treaties that limited the rights of foreign investors to pursue international settlements in the hope that existing agreements could be renegotiated along the same lines But the renegotiations have not borne much fruit According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development India has signed 86 bilateral investment treaties since the mid-1990s; 74 have been terminated almost all within the past five years That includes the treaties with Britain and the Netherlands under which Cairn and Vodafone respectively won their awardsA lack of access to international dispute resolution leaves foreign investors at the mercy of a slow-moving domestic legal system and may well have made them more reluctant to plough capital into the country One corporate lawsuit for instance has been pending since 1983India approach might also hinder its trade policy A reluctance to embrace dispute-resolution systems was not the main reason why it decided against signing Asia recent big trade pacts the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership But it will probably frustrate any attempt to join large blocs in future Until India resolves the tension between its desire for investment and its desire for sovereignty a law change might do little to entice foreign investors For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Aug 14th 2021,A new theory suggests that day-to-day trading has lasting effects on stockmarkets,ECONOMICS IS ABOUT supply and demandjust not in financial markets A building block of asset-pricing theory is that the value of stocks and bonds is determined by their expected future payoffs rather than by ignorant trades If an investor unthinkingly throws money at say shares in Apple opportunistic short-sellers are supposed to line up to take the other side of the bet keeping the share price anchored to where it ought to be given Apple likely profits Free money gets picked up and dumb money gets picked off Markets are efficient in that prices come to reflect genuine information about the futureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAt this point your columnist may be in danger of provoking guffaws It has been a bad year for the textbooks Retail investors have driven up the prices of meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC Cryptocurrencies the fundamentals of which cannot easily be analysed have soared too Even America bond market is a puzzle: the ten-year Treasury yield is only 14% even though annual consumer-price inflation has reached 54% So-called “technical” explanations for market movements“where you put things that you can’t quite explain” according to Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserveare in fashion So it is apt that an emerging theory of how markets work says that even random financial flows may matter a great deal to asset pricesIn a recent working paper Xavier Gabaix of Harvard University and Ralph Koijen of the University of Chicago study how the aggregate value of America stockmarket responds to buying and selling Researchers have studied flows before typically finding noticeable effects as investors sell one stock and buy another Messrs Gabaix and Koijen are interested in whether this finding scales up to move the market as a wholea thesis that is consistent with the smaller-scale findings but more provocativeThe first challenge is getting definitions straight The financial press often writes about money flowing into stocks but for a security to be bought it also has to be sold The authors’ definition of inflows relies on the fact that investment funds often promise to maintain a fraction of their portfolio in equities a retirement fund offered by Vanguard say might offer investors 80% exposure to stocks and 20% to bonds A flow into stocks is defined as an investor using fresh cash or the proceeds of selling bonds to buy funds that hold at least some equities The higher the share devoted to equities the larger the “flow” The amount of securities in existence does not changefor every buyer there is a sellerbut their price is forced up until the value of the market is sufficient to satisfy each fund mandate to hold the target fraction of its portfolio in stocksUsing statistical wizardry the authors isolate flows into stocks that appear unexplained by for example GDP growth over the period from 1993 to 2019 They find that markets respond in a manner contrary to that set out in the textbooks: they magnify rather than dampen the impact of flows A dollar of inflows into equities increases the aggregate value of the market by $3-8 Markets are not “elastic” as textbooks say they should be Messrs Gabaix and Koijen therefore call their idea the “inelastic markets hypothesis”Does inelastic mean inefficient? A trader who could see flows coming would get rich quickly It has long been known that the so-called “front-running” of big trades which is usually banned is profitable But flows are hard to predict says Mr Koijen A true believer in markets might argue that unforeseeable flows are the mechanism by which the right price is reached and reflect new information coming to the foreEven if flows are ill-informed though the opportunity to profit from them is small once they have already moved the price says Mr Gabaix And the arbitrageurs who are meant to keep the whole market anchored to fundamentals do not seem to exist The authors note that at the onset of the global financial crisis hedge funds owned less than 4% of the stockmarket and that their trades tended to amplify market movements not dampen them Funds are constrained by limits on leverage and by the fact that they must cope with the investments and redemptions of underlying investors Different parts of the market do not trade much with each other as would be necessary for markets to be elasticThe paper will surprise the typical economist who according to the authors’ surveys believes that flows do not affect prices It also threatens associated financial theories One is the Modigliani-Miller theorem which says that it does not matter whether a company finances itself with equity or with debt In inelastic markets by contrast a firm that issues debt to buy back its stock will find that it drives up both its own share price and the broader market The authors look only at stocks but other research suggests that bond markets are inelastic albeit to a lesser degree As a result central banks’ quantitative-easing policies under which they buy bonds will affect bond yieldssomething that many traders take as given but that purists say should not happenMessrs Gabaix and Koijen hope to inspire research that explains market movements using the granular observable choices of investors rather than attributing gyrations in markets to unobservable changes in beliefs And portfolio managers who typically try to forecast future business conditions might find it productive to try to predict flows into and out of investment funds insteadKeynesian beautyThere may be an irony here The authors do not study whether markets have become less elastic over time but in recent decades funds that passively allocate fixed percentages to indices have grown in popularity making their theory more plausible The trend is a vote of confidence in markets’ efficiency which should make the returns to active stock-picking low Yet passivity may breed inelasticityand therefore create opportunities for a canny investor who is ahead of the crowd For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

 Aug 11th 2021,America inflation scare becomes less menacing,THE USED-CAR salesman occupies a distinctive if rather unflattering place in American culture In “The Grapes of Wrath” John Steinbeck classic novel set in the Depression sleazy salesmen prey on miserable farmers “Cadillac Man” a film from 1990 features a fast-talking merchant with a bevy of mistresses These depictions and many others are unfair to most of the hard-working types on car lots But in recent months such salesmen have occupied a distinctive and unflattering place in America economy as avatars of worryingly rapid inflationListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhen consumer prices rose by 54% in June compared with a year earlier the fastest pace since 2008 used cars accounted for a third of the pickup So analysts are paying unusually close attention to the market for used cars or as those selling them prefer to say “pre-owned” vehicles On August 11th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported that annual headline inflation in July again hit 54% But when you look under the hood the gauge for used cars offers reassurance: prices levelled off suggesting that the inflation scare may prove transitoryThe price surge in used cars has been indicative of the pressures building as businesses roar back from the depths of the pandemic only to run headlong into shortages of everything from critical parts to staff A dearth of semiconductors in the vehicle industry itself a product of bunged-up supply chains has had ripple effects Without the microchips needed for electronic systems carmakers have cut back production Given the lack of new vehicles would-be buyers have turned to the used market leading to a spike in demand But there has been a shortfall in supply at the same time because existing owners have held on to their cars for longer than normal amid all the pandemic disruptions The result: a 30% increase in used-car prices between April and JuneSimilar dynamics have pushed up prices for home furniture airline tickets and clothing Alarming as that might sound the fact that these increases were all tied to the lopsided recovery from the pandemic was taken as evidence by many analysts that the jump in inflation may be a passing phenomenon Sure enough the data from July lent credence to that view Airline fares fell slightly as did the cost of furniture Prices for clothing and used cars were basically unchanged The overall consumer-price index rose by 05% month-on-month in July down from 09% in June The slowdown in core inflation stripping out food and energy was even sharper although in annualised terms it was still well above the Federal Reserve 2% targetThe ebbing of inflation is for now a vindication for the Fed Although it has hinted that it may begin to wind down its ultra-loose monetary policy this year by reducing its monthly bond purchases most Fed officials think it will only start raising interest rates in 2023a patience potentially at odds with high inflation The Fed to be sure is hardly alone A decline in Treasury yields in recent months in part reflects investors’ falling inflation expectations in addition to concerns over the continued economic drag from the pandemicNevertheless it is too soon to sound the all-clear Unlike cars or couches which are not exactly everyday purchases some recurring expenditures look a little headier The price of shelter which includes rents paid by tenants and “imputed” rents for home-owners rose by 04% in July from June and could rise further as universities and offices open up Economists at Citigroup a bank pointed to yet another big increase in restaurant prices This they said was a clear sign that a tight labour market is pushing up wages and feeding through to higher pricesMoreover used cars may yet drive back into the spotlight At a showroom in Bethesda Carlos Correa an affable salesman explains that his company normally has three lots full of cars Now though they are down to two which are still mostly empty The levelling-off in prices is he thinks explained by tepid summer demand “It usually quiet this time of year” he says Autumn could turn up the heat on prices again For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 10th 2021,Will the rich world worker deficit last?,AMERICA’S LATEST jobs report was both encouraging and sobering The world largest economy added 943000 jobs in July That is the best tally in nearly a yearbut even at this pace employment will not catch up with its pre-crisis level until early 2022 six months after output regained its peak Jobs in the rest of the rich world too are likely to take a while to return to pre-pandemic highs Demand for workers is still lower than it was before covid-19 struck; and more important people have withdrawn from the world of workListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBefore the pandemic the rich world enjoyed an extraordinary jobs boom In 2019 a higher share of people over the age of 15 was in the labour forceie either in work or looking for itthan at any point since at least 1990 The working-age employment rate the share of 16- to 64-year-olds in a job was at an all-time high in over half of rich countriesNow labour markets are surprising in the opposite direction Harmonised statistics are published with a long lag but our best guess based on data from eight countries is that employment in the rich world is 3% below its pre-pandemic high see chart 1 That points to a deficit of about 18m peoplea huge waste of talent not to mention a hit to tax revenuesWhat explains the gap? One potential explanation is that there is too little demand for labour A rough measure of the need for workers involves adding the total number of people already employed to the number of unfilled vacancies see chart 2 Even in America with its roaring economy this gauge has yet to fully recover: despite record high vacancies it is 2% below its pre-crisis level Some firms such as those in manufacturing have healthy-ish demand for workers but in leisure and hospitality demand is still 6% below its pre-pandemic levelCovid-19 restrictions such as travel bans surely play a role in explaining weak demand In Paris plenty of hotels remain closed Your correspondent recently suffered the indignity of having to board a red-eye from JFK airport entirely sober because all the airport bars were still shutSome economists see insufficient spending as a cause of subdued labour demand In three-quarters of rich countries the “fiscal impulse” a measure of the oomph government spending gives the economy is expected to turn negative this year Yet it seems unlikely that governments can close the worker deficit simply by spending more Compare America and the EU In the spring of 2020 aggregate working hours in both economies tanked America then passed gargantuan stimulus packages while European governments chose more modest measures The recovery in working hours since then has been only marginally better in Americanot much extra labour for a lot of extra cashThis suggests that the worker deficit is not just about demand The supply of workers may have fallen by more limiting the jobs recovery The share of people in the workforce in the rich world has fallen sharply since the pandemic began and we estimate is about 15 percentage points below its peak Other indicators also point to a scarcity of workers Wages for instance are growing fairly stronglyTo understand whether the worker deficit will ease then you must consider why labour supply has fallen Three broad explanations stand out: disruption owing to the spread of covid-19; the impact of welfare policy and pensions; and changes to attitudes wrought by the pandemicTake disruption first It is commonly believed that school closures have made it impossible for parents particularly mothers to take a job The evidence for this is mixed though Analysis by Jason Furman Melissa Kearney and Wilson Powell III concludes that extra joblessness among mothers of young children accounts for a “negligible” share of America employment deficit Despite talk of a “shecession” early in the pandemic in most rich countries the worker deficit for men remains largerDisruption to migration may be a more plausible cause of the shortfall Before the pandemic immigration drove workforce growth Then countries slammed borders shut to contain cases Today lower visa issuance in America accounts for about a fifth of its worker deficit Australia is losing migrants on net for the first time since records began in the 1950sFear of the virus may also have disrupted labour supply Even in highly vaccinated countries a large share of people worry about contracting covid-19 see chart 3 This surely puts some people off working in high-contact sectors such as hospitalityLower labour supply might also reflect the impact of welfare policies such as handouts and pensionsour second category of reasons Frothy stockmarkets may have boosted the value of some pension pots prompting people to start their golf-club membership earlier than expected That seems to have been the case in America: recent research by Goldman Sachs a bank finds that “excess retirees” account for about a quarter of the decline in the country participation rateIn other places however the share of 55- to 64-year-olds in the workforce has gone up Research by the OECD a rich-country think-tank has shown that in many countries pension-fund returns were meagre in 2020 perhaps because some fund managers sold at the bottom of the market in the spring Canadian funds’ real returns at 19% were one-third of America; in Australia they were negative Small wonder that in both places the participation of older workers has risenFor younger people meanwhile generous benefit payments introduced in 2020 an element of bonanza stimulus packages may have blunted the need to find work Although many of these are now being withdrawn people might have used past handouts to accumulate savings which might delay their return to work According to our analysis households in the rich world have built up additional funds worth a tenth of annual consumer spendingThe third broad reason for lower labour supply relates to shifting attitudes One intriguing possibility is that the pandemic has made people value work less Many report to surveys that they treasure family time more than they did A shift in work preferences would be a seismic event; but it is frustratingly hard to measure whether it is actually happening A clue however comes from Britain which tracks people who say they want to work fewer hours even if their pay falls Normally economic downturns prompt reported “overemployment” to collapse But not in this oneBring all this together and the extent to which the worker deficit endures seems likely to depend in part on how long the disruption and the fear caused by the pandemic last Rising wages might lure some of those who left the workforce back into jobs But the longer the pandemic goes on the harder it becomes for those who left to return and the more likely it is that new habits stick The worker deficit might be here for some time For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 7th 2021,The SEC sets its sights on the crypto “Wild West”,WHEN GARY GENSLER took over as the head of America Securities and Exchange Commission SEC in April he might have seemed pretty crypto-friendly Only months before he had taught a course on cryptocurrencies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; he has said that the innovation associated with bitcoin will be a “catalyst for change” in finance Yet speaking at the Aspen Security Forum on August 3rd he probably dashed the hopes of crypto buffs He signalled that he would seek tougher policing of the crypto-sphere which he described as “rife with fraud scams and abuse”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Gensler offered the most fleshed-out vision yet for how the SEC might regulate cryptocurrencies These tokens he said were not a means of exchange but “highly speculative stores of value” That in itself was not a probleminvestors should be left to gamble should they wish to But punters often could not access “rigorous balanced and complete information” meaning a lot of them could be hurtThat calls for greater investor protections which fall into three broad buckets The first relates to what the SEC already does The regulator claims jurisdiction over the crypto assets that it defines as securities; issuers of these must provide disclosures and abide by other rules The SEC‘s definition uses a number of criteria including the “Howey Test” which asks whether investors have a stake in a common enterprise and are led to expect profits from the efforts of a third party Bitcoin and ether the two biggest cryptocurrencies do not meet this criterion they are commodities under American law But Mr Gensler thinks that among the 1600 tokens with at least $1m in market capitalisation a fair few probably count as securitiesand do not follow the rules These he said may include stablecoins virtual monies pegged to conventional money some of which may represent a stake in a crypto platform Mr Gensler asked Congress for more staff to police themThe second bucket covers work in progress: areas where Mr Gensler team is considering how to treat new products being brought to market For months the SEC has sat on applications for bitcoin ETFs and related products filed by big Wall Street names like Goldman Sachs and Fidelity Mr Gensler hinted that in order to be approved these may have to comply with the stricter laws governing mutual funds The strictures could prove too costly and rigid for firms hoping to list vehicles Mr Gensler did signal openness to narrower ETFs focused on bitcoin futures that trade on the Chicago Mercantile ExchangeThe last bucket comprises new powers that the SEC will seek from Congress so as to prevent transactions and products “falling between regulatory cracks” Mr Gensler is chiefly concerned with platforms engaged in crypto trading or lending as well as in decentralised finance DeFi where smart contracts replicate financial transactions without a trusted intermediary Some of these he said may host tokens that should be regulated as securities; others could be riddled with scamsMr Gensler is not the first to toughen up on crypto though his attack is perhaps the most comprehensive Other officials have focused mainly on stablecoins which back their issuance with heaps of conventional assets Jerome Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve has hinted that these should be regulated as money-market funds or even banks Janet Yellen America treasury secretary has urged the quick adoption of rules The sheriff may be out in front but the cavalry is not far behind For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 7th 2021,America roaring recovery might carry lessons for future recessions,Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEditor note August 6th 2021: This article has been updated for the publication of July payrolls figuresA COMMITTEE OF eight prominent economists made it official on July 19th The covid-19 recession America deepest since the Depression was also its shortest spanning just March and April 2020 That tests the very definition of a recession which the National Bureau of Economic Research describes as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months” A recession it was judged nonetheless given its breadth and extraordinary depth The plunge in output in the second quarter of 2020 was more than three times the second-largest quarterly drop in America post-war historyThe rebound in GDP thankfully has been comparably dramatic The 338% annualised rate of growth notched in the third quarter of 2020 was about twice as fast as the second-best quarterly performance in the post-war era As the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on July 29th output overtook its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of this year Though unique in some ways this unfolding recovery resembles past recoveries in other important respects It may prove similar enough to help economists gain a better understanding of what policy can achieve in the face of hardshipRecent American recoveries have tended to be “jobless” meaning that labour markets have taken far longer to regain lost ground than has overall production During the seven recessions from 1948 to 1980 it took an average of about five quarters for GDP to surpass its previous peak Employment took only a little longer to recover: six quarters on average From the 1980s onwards however the recovery in employment began to lag behind that in output Across the four downturns preceding the covid-19 crisis GDP regained its peak in just six quarters on average But employment did not pass its previous high for a full 15 quartersIt is not quite right of course to call today recovery jobless About 22m jobs were lost between February and April 2020 and 166m have since been added back Still hiring is once again lagging behind GDP Though output reached a new high in the second quarter employment remained more than 4% below its pre-pandemic level Moreover the resulting jump in the level of output per worker over the course of this recovery looks remarkably similar to that which followed the global financial crisis see chart At present America is producing more output than it managed just a year and a half ago with roughly 6m fewer workersThis would seem to suggest that productivity has leapt across the economy It may well have done The pandemic has forced many firms to experiment with new technologies and working patterns and favoured some business models over others The effect on output per worker in some sectors has been dramatic: labour productivity in retail trade jumped by nearly 8% in 2020 for example The surge in output per worker also reflects the changing mix of the workforce Employment in the leisure and hospitality industries where productivity tends to be low remains about 10% below the pre-pandemic level compared to a 3% shortfall in the higher-productivity manufacturing sectorThat productivity-boosting restructuring might accompany a period of economic stress is hardly surprising In work published in 2012 for instance Nir Jaimovich of the University of Zurich and Henry Siu of the University of British Columbia analysed the destruction of “routine” jobswork that follows simple procedures and is thus highly susceptible to automation or outsourcingand found its incidence to be concentrated around recessions Furthermore the researchers noted the destruction of routine work in recessions seems to account for much of the joblessness of economic recoveries since the mid-1980s But output per worker eventually stagnated over these plodding recoveries perhaps because low-wage service-sector work only slowly expanded to absorb the lingering pool of unemployed labourThe present recovery might reveal whether a more forceful policy response can yield a different outcome By contrast with past recoveries this one has been positively blistering thanks to a burst of deficit spending rivalled only by that during the second world war Over the first four quarters of the recovery output rose by just over 12% Rapid growth is expected to continue; the IMF for instance projects that GDP will rise by an impressive 7% in 2021 as a whole and by a further 5% in 2022Push itHow might the future path of jobs and productivity evolve as a result? One scenario is that powered by stimulus the economic expansion remains rapid but that early gains in productivity fail to be preserved Consumer demand would shift back towards labour-intensive services leading to frantic hiring The result would be a jobs-rich recovery but a productivity-poor one Were the economy to grow as projected by the IMF and output per worker to fall back to pre-pandemic levels then employment would rise towards 166m by the end of 2022 compared with 147m today That would mean there were some 14m more jobs than in February 2020 when the unemployment rate stood at 35%Another possibility looms however Perhaps growth in expanding high-productivity industries which can afford to pay higher wages will continue leaving fewer people willing to fill low-productivity low-wage service-sector jobs Where past jobless recoveries might have encouraged the creation of more low-wage services jobs a faster expansion today might break the link perhaps forcing employers in these industries to automate instead America would enjoy a jobs-rich recovery while also emerging from the pandemic structurally changed with a permanent increase in its level of productivityWishful thinking perhaps But whatever the outcome America spending will have purchased a faster recovery and new information about how best to ease the pain of a recession And it might just have gained a productivity boost For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 7th 2021,Does perishable e-money represent the future of fiscal stimulus?,“IF YOU WANT to see how the free market really works this is the place to come” said Milton Friedman in “Free to Choose” his 1980s TV series He was sitting on a cross-harbour ferry in Hong Kong The city he said was an “almost laboratory experiment in what happens when governmentleaves people free to pursue their own objectives”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis week the same city began another experiment: not merely leaving people free to pursue their own objectives but giving them free money to pursue their own purchases On August 1st Hong Kongers received the first instalment of the government consumption voucher an effort to revive the city hard-hit retail industry The amounts are generous HK$5000 or $640 and the distribution is slick The money is added to a person Octopus card widely used in shops and on public transport or paid into e-payment apps such as Alipay Shops are now vying for their customers’ unearned dollars The Mira hotel where Edward Snowden revealed America secrets to the world is offering 75% off a romantic “staycay” Unlike ordinary cash handouts these e-vouchers must be spent within a few months Otherwise they will “expire”So will Hong Kongers use it or lose it? Similar experiments have had mixed results After South Korea provided perishable vouchers in May 2020 only 36% of households said they had raised their retail spending and some of them cut spending of other kinds After Taiwan distributed physical vouchers in 2009 most people spent them on things they would have bought anyway according to Kamhon Kan of Academia Sinica in Taipei and his co-authors Only about a quarter used them for unplanned purchases making them no more effective than America more conventional tax rebates in 2008These shortcomings would not surprise proponents of the “permanent-income hypothesis” who argue that households will try to smooth their consumption over time spending a fraction of their estimated lifetime wealth In these models windfall gains are largely squirrelled away Hong Kongers cannot set aside their voucher money without losing it But the windfall nonetheless lets them save more of their ordinary money because they do not have to spend it on the stuff they are buying with their vouchersThe originator of the permanent-income hypothesis was none other than Milton Friedman If Hong Kong new experiment is to work as well as the government hopes one of his most cherished cities will have to overcome one of his most celebrated theoriesFor more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter
 Aug 5th 2021,As more defaults loom China finance regulators face a dilemma,A DOCUMENT CIRCULATING among Chinese banks in early July has caused unease among investors and local officials Known as “Document No 15” the regulatory directive says that banks should stop lending to heavily indebted local-government financing vehicles LGFVs companies set up by city or provincial governments to finance building projects and public works The groups which have not so far been allowed to default have about 487trn yuan $75trn in debts 119trn yuan of which is held in fixed-income securities They routinely use bank loans to pay interest on bonds Ending the steady stream of credit is a recipe for turmoil “If banks don’t give them a blood transfusion” a local investor told Chinese media “LGFVs will face a default crisis”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThen the circular vanished along with most references to it in state media Some investors believe it may have been released prematurely and that another less severe version will eventually replace it Others say banks are carrying out the orders but fear that the first LGFV default will unleash chaos in the bond market of which securities issued by LGFVs make up about 10%Such is the dilemma China financial regulators face They must stop poorly managed groups from hogging capital and allow the worst of them to fail But they must do so without causing panic or cutting off healthy companies’ access to finance LGFVs are just one of many cases testing their resolveDefaults in China onshore bond market have climbed to a record with companies missing payments on about 97bn yuan in principal in the first half of 2021 up by almost 50% compared with the same period last year according to Wind a data provider China Fortune Land defaulted on a $530m bond in February in what was the country largest-ever default by a property developer; Chongqing Energy Investment a state-run firm that produces most of the city of Chongqing coal defaulted in March denting confidence in local authorities’ support for state-owned groupsMore worrying however are the size and profile of some struggling companies Defaulting groups had on average about 1bn yuan in outstanding onshore bonds in 2015 a year after China experienced its first default in recent times That figure has climbed to nearly 9bn yuan this year reckons S&P a rating agency Evergrande a troubled property giant is on the hook for more than $100bn in interest-bearing offshore and onshore debt A series of missteps and growing regulatory pressure has led to a collapse in investor confidence Its offshore bonds have traded at less than 50 cents on the dollar indicating that many investors expect a defaultGroups controlled by the central government used not to be allowed to face collapse But now Huarong a state asset manager with more than $40bn in offshore and onshore debt seems to be in trouble Once among the most powerful financial conglomerates in China it has not published its results for 2020 leading investors to guess at the poor shape of its books and bet on its demiseThese risks threaten to shatter the calm portrayed by technocrats in Beijing But regulators may be more willing to countenance defaults than they were in the past They have seized control in two key areas that make defaults easier One is a tighter grip over unruly companies owned by municipal and provincial governments Upon defaulting these groups were often allowed to make inside deals that benefited well-connected creditors but excluded others Investors involved in such situations say that this is changingTake for instance the default of Yongcheng Coal in November A probe after the default showed that the company had shifted assets round in an attempt to pay less to some creditors Regulators promptly stepped in to make clear to all investors including foreign ones that accounting tricks would not stop the company from paying out as much as it could That lessened investors’ concerns about how they might be treated in a default and crucially kept markets liquid even as more firms face distressRegulators have also grabbed more control over the restructuring process State-backed restructurings used to be mired in opacity That has changed; after Peking University Founder Group PUFG a conglomerate linked to China top university defaulted in 2019 many of the terms of its restructuring were made public A deal was worked out in just 581 days compared with an average of 679 in China noted S&P After a court-led restructuring the recovery rate on PUFG assets was 314% beating the average recovery rate of 237% in 50 other Chinese restructuring deals Such efficiencies are attracting more market-based investments and reducing the need for state-mandated ones says Charles Chang of S&PThese cases will guide officials as they take on more daunting problems If Evergrande woes persist many investors believe it could be allowed to default and move into restructuring Huarong with its sprawling business is seen as carrying more systemic risk than Evergrande says Edmund Goh of Aberdeen Standard Investments This means a state-brokered bail-out as opposed to a market-based one could lie aheadLGFVs may pose the biggest risk of all The first default “is going to cause a lot of market turbulence” says Larry Hu of Macquarie an investment bank If regulators enforce Document No 15 a bellwether default could take place in the coming months A softer stance by contrast would suggest that they are not quite ready to face up to the challenge An early version of this article was published online on August 4th 2021For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to Money Talks our weekly newsletter

“tacticians” who reckon its value will rise as more people invest in it; and “speculators” who want to gamble Though a crash would come as a monumental upset to the first group it is least likely to sell out; the third meanwhile will flee at the first sign of trouble To avoid a terminal stampede the second group must be persuaded to stay It is unlikely to do so if the price falls to zeroA crash would puncture the crypto economy Bitcoin minerswho compete to validate transactions and are rewarded with new coinswould have less incentive to carry on bringing the verification process and the supply of bitcoin to a halt Investors would probably also dump other cryptocurrencies Recent tantrums have shown that where bitcoin goes other digital monies follow says Philip Gradwell of Chainalysis a data firmThe result would be the destruction of a significant amount of wealth Long-term holders would suffer small losses relative to the price they paid but cede huge unrealised gains see chart 2 The biggest losses relative to the purchase price would fall on those who bought less than a year ago at an average price of $37000 That would include most institutional investors exposed to crypto including hedge funds university endowments mutual funds and some companiesThe total value erased would go beyond the market capitalisation of digital assets A crash would also wipe out private investments in crypto firms such as exchanges $37bn since 2010 reckons PitchBook a data provider as well as the value of listed crypto firms worth about $90bn Payments companies like PayPal Revolut and Visa would lose a chunk of growing juicy business which would dent their valuations Others that have ridden the crypto boom such as Nvidia a microchip-maker would also take a hit All in all perhaps $2trn might be lost from this first shockwave a little more than the market capitalisation of AmazonContagion could spread through several channels to other assets both crypto and mainstream One channel is leverage Fully 90% of the money invested in bitcoin is spent on derivatives like “perpetual” swapsbets on future price fluctuations that never expire Most of these are traded on unregulated exchanges such as FTX and Binance from which customers borrow to make bets even bigger Modest price swings can trigger big margin calls; when they are not met the exchanges are quick to liquidate their customers’ holdings turbocharging falls in crypto prices Exchanges would have to swallow big losses on defaulted debtThe rush to meet margin calls in cryptocurrencythe collateral of choice for leveraged derivativescould force punters to dump conventional assets to free up cash Alternatively they might give up trying to meet those calls since their crypto holdings would no longer be worth much triggering liquidations Meanwhile other types of leverage exist where regulated exchanges or even banks have lent dollars to investors who then bought bitcoin Some have lent dollars against crypto collateral In both cases borrowers nearing default might seek to liquidate other assetsThe extent of leverage in the system is hard to gauge; the dozen exchanges that list perpetual swaps are all unregulated But “open interest” the total amount in derivatives contracts outstanding at any one time provides an idea of the direction of travel says Kyle Soska of Carnegie Mellon University It has grown from $16bn in March 2020 to $24bn today This is not a perfect proxy for total leverage as it is not clear how much collateral stands behind the various contracts But forced liquidations of leveraged positions in past downturns give a sense of how much is at risk On May 18th alone as bitcoin lost nearly a third of its value they came to $9bnA second channel of transmission comes from the “stablecoins” that oil the wheels of crypto trading Because changing dollars for bitcoin is slow and costly traders wanting to realise gains and reinvest proceeds often transact in stablecoins which are pegged to the dollar or the euro Such coins the largest of which are Tether and USD coin are now worth more than $100bn On some crypto platforms they are the main means of exchangeIssuers back their stablecoins with piles of assets rather like money-market funds But these are not solely or even mainly held in cash Tether for instance says 50% of its assets were held in commercial paper 12% in secured loans and 10% in corporate bonds funds and precious metals at the end of March A cryptocrash could lead to a run on stablecoins forcing issuers to dump their assets to make redemptions In July Fitch a rating agency warned that a sudden mass redemption of tethers could “affect the stability of short-term credit markets” Officials from America Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve are paying closer attention to the risks from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in particularA cryptocalypse could affect broader sentiment even beyond fire sales The extent of this is unclear: more entities are now exposed to cryptocurrencies but few have staked big shares of their wealth on them so losses would be widespread but shallow Crucially banks are immune; and most will not rush to hold bitcoin on their balance-sheets any time soon The Basel club of supervisors recently proposed making banks fund their bitcoin holdings with only capital not debtBut a worse case is not hard to imagine Low interest rates have led investors to take more risk A crypto collapse could cause them to cool on other exotic assets In recent months the correlation between bitcoin prices and meme stocks and even stocks at large has risen That is partly because punters reinvest gains made on faddish stocks into crypto and vice versaA sell-off would begin with the most leveraged punterstypically individuals and hedge fundsin high-risk areas: meme stocks junk bonds special-purpose acquisition vehicles Investors exposed to these facing questions from their investment committees would follow in turn making risky assets less liquid and perhaps provoking a general slump If that sounds improbable remember that the S&P 500 America main stock index fell by 25% in a day after retail punters’ infatuation with GameStop a video-game retailer wrong-footed a few hedge fundsFor general market turmoil to ensue then you would need a lot of things to go wrong including the price of bitcoin to fall all the way to zero Still our extreme scenario suggests that leverage stablecoins and sentiment are the main channels through which any crypto-downturn big or small will spread more widely And crypto is only becoming more entwined with conventional finance Goldman Sachs plans to launch a crypto exchange-traded fund;

 Jul 31st 2021,Why have some places suffered more covid-19 deaths than others?,SEVENTEEN MONTHS into the covid-19 pandemic plenty of questions about the catastrophe remain unanswered It is still unclear how SARS-CoV-2 originated for instance Another puzzle is why some areas have had less destructive epidemics than others Why has Florida had fewer deaths per person from covid-19 than the American average even though restrictions there have been looser for longer? But researchers are getting closer to the “magic” variable: the factor that does most to explain variance in deaths from the virus It turns out that this has little to do with health measures climate or geography Instead it relates to economicsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe huge literature on the determinants of covid-19 infections and deaths finds that many widely assumed relationships do not always hold in the real world Everyone knows that the old are most at risk; but Japan where 28% of people are over the age of 65 compared with 9% globally has seen remarkably few deaths so far Some studies suggest that places that had bad flu seasons before the pandemic suffered less since; but other researchers have called that conclusion into question There is no consistent correlation between the toughness of lockdowns and cases or deathsFaced with these surprising results a hunt has begun that is as morbid as it is nerdy Wonks are searching for less obvious variables that do more to explain variation in deaths from covid-19 And so far the most powerful of them all is inequalityusually measured as the Gini coefficient of income where zero represents perfect equality and one represents perfect inequalityIn a recent exercise Youyang Gu a data scientist ran multiple versions of a model that seeks to find correlations between 41 different variables and American state-level deaths from covid-19 Only three variables “consistently have non-zero coefficients” he finds: inequality population density and nursing-home residents per person And of those three inequality has the biggest effectLook around the world and it seems that Mr Gu may be on to something Deaths from covid-19 have been lower in egalitarian Scandinavia even in Sweden which imposed few restrictions than for Europe as a whole France where the Gini is 029 has seen far fewer excess deaths than neighbouring Britain where it is 034 New York state has both extremely high inequality and a huge covid-19 death toll; Florida is less exceptional on both countsFew other researchers rank the variables in the way that Mr Gu does Yet our survey of the dozens of papers investigating the determinants of the toll from covid-19 finds that inequality has consistently high explanatory power A recent study by Frank Elgar of McGill University and colleagues looking at 84 countries finds that a 1% increase in the Gini coefficient is associated with a 067% increase in the mortality rate from covid-19 Another by Annabel Tan Jessica Hinman and Hoda Abdel Magid of Stanford University looks at American counties They find that the association between income inequality and covid-19 cases and deaths varied over 2020 but was generally positive; higher inequality tends to lead to more sufferingThere is a lot less research on the potential reasons behind this intriguing relationship Three sound plausible The first relates to pre-existing health A study in 2016 by Beth Truesdale and Christopher Jencks of Harvard University found “modest evidence” of a link between higher income inequality and lower life expectancy This may be because of what economists call a “concave” relationship between health and income: giving a rich woman an extra dollar in income probably improves her health by less than removing a dollar from a poor man harms his People in worse health tend to suffer more from covid-19 and indeed some other research has drawn links between inequality and pre-existing conditions that may aggravate the disease such as obesityThe second potential factor is workplace relations Workers in relatively egalitarian countries tend to have more bargaining power and may therefore find it easier to air and redress concerns with employers This can have its disadvantages but it may help stop practices that aid the spread of covid-19 In Sweden a country with strong workers’ rights frontline or “essential” workers such as meat-packers and police officers have not on average faced a higher risk of dying from covid-19 than others potentially limiting the overall number of deaths This is in contrast to results from America Britain and Canada which are more lightly regulated One study in California found that people in some jobs were much more likely to die of covid-19 than those in other occupations Chefs and taxi drivers saw among the biggest increases in excess deaths in 2020The third factor relates to social capital In areas of high inequality people are more likely to say they distrust strangers or to have little interest in civic engagement Research published by the IMF in 2016 suggests why: in places where people have very different lifestyles they see little in common with each other Weak social capital almost certainly reduces people willingness to comply with virus-control measures such as self-isolation or mask mandates for which the private incentives to obey are weakEqual opportunityThere were already good reasons to think that inequality at least in some countries was too high This is another Yet turning around the income-distribution supertanker can hardly be done overnight and some solutions to income inequality such as raising taxes bring trade-offs of their own In the meantime governments need to tailor their pandemic response to take account of inequalities That could include for instance changing the economic incentives to stay at home if infectioussay by using self-isolation paymentsor investing more in poor children health to make them healthier adults Without these improvements high inequality is likely to continue to mean greater vulnerability to pandemics

 Jul 31st 2021,Prices in Turkey are surging But by how much?,EARLIER THIS summer Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that he had asked his central-bank governor the fourth he has appointed in two years to begin slashing interest rates Mr Erdogan even provided a date for the start of the easing cycle “We need to see July August for interest rates to start coming down” he said He may have to wait much longer A week ahead of the bank monetary-policy meeting on July 14th the country statistical authority TUIK revealed that inflation had swollen to 175% in June beating even the most pessimistic forecasts That is more than three times the central bank inflation target of 5% and close to the benchmark lending rate 19% In the event the bank had no choice but to keep rates unchanged It will almost certainly do the same in AugustListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMany Turks are convinced that the situation is even worse than the data suggest According to a recent poll a whopping 83% believe the true inflation rate is higher than the official one The Inflation Research Group an independent group of academics believes it to be in the region of 40% The group own index relies on price data gathered from online retailers and updated several times a day says Veysel Ulusoy the academic heading the project Its basket of goods overlaps largely with TUIK but excludes items like alcohol education and health where the government is able to control prices Mr Ulusoy insists his price index is more consistent with consumer and market sentimentFor their troubles he and his colleagues may face charges In May TUIK filed a criminal complaint against the researchers claiming that the metadata on their website did not meet legal standards The group has been “misinforming the public” and “undermining trust in official statistics” the complaint says That trust appears to be long gonePowered by stimulus spending and booming demand inflation is mounting across most economies But Turkey problem has much deeper roots Double-digit inflation took hold four years ago the result of cheap credit bad monetary policy and a currency crisis and has not relaxed its grip since This has revived fears of a return to the 1970s when inflation hovered near 20% for a few years only to explode into triple digits It took three more decades and a painful economic crisis in 2001 to bring it below 10%The central bank has pledged to keep prices in check But under pressure from Mr Erdogan it will raise rates only as a last resort and possibly too late “If we can’t control inflation at the current levels we may lose control” warns Kerim Rota a former treasury official and one of the founders of a fledgling opposition party Mr Rota says he retains some faith in the official data “But even with the TUIK figures” he says “this is a disaster” 
 Jul 31st 2021,The case for a further narrowing of euro-zone bond spreads,IT WAS BUSINESS as usual at the European Central Bank ECB At the press conference on July 22nd that followed its regular monetary-policy meeting Christine Lagarde the bank boss might have been hoping for a few plaudits The ECB had recently announced that it was changing to a symmetric inflation target bringing it into line with practice everywhere else No such luck Many of the questions were critical in nature Why is the ECB not doing more?

 Jul 26th 2021,Robinhood takes its IPO to the masses,Editor note July 29th 2021: This article was updated after the first day of trading in Robinhood sharesIT WOULD BE hard for a firm that describes itself as “democratising investing” to go public in any other way After Robinhood listing on the Nasdaq on July 29th institutional investors will as is usual be able to buy and trade shares on the exchange Less conventionally the broker also allowed its users to buy up to a third of its shares before trading They bought about a quarter according to BloombergListen to this story Enjoy more audio

excitement as she took part in an initial public offering IPO for the first time bidding for a single share in Robinhood The slick graphics explained how IPO shares are allocated and reassured punters thatas is not the case at other brokersorder size assets and the age of the account would play no part in whether a bid was accepted or not Before most firms go public they do a roadshow which typically involves investment bankers compiling snazzy slideshows donning their sharpest suits and fanning out to meeting rooms in big cities to canvass support from pension funds asset managers and other institutional investors Robinhood instead made its 40-minute pitch online to anyone who wanted to listen on the Saturday afternoon ahead of its debutThe anti-establishment approach is all too fitting No other company fortunes have been as tied to the craze for meme stocks fuelled by online forums and lockdown-induced spare time Robinhood which will go public at a valuation of $32bn has seen its user base explode during the pandemic see chart 1 It lost 84% of that value in the first day trading Its longer-term prospects are likely to be determined by wherever the retail mania the subject of much regulatory hand-wringing goes nextFor decades retail investors were overlooked and underserved The rich might have dabbled in trading stocks directly but most workers earned defined-benefit pensions which kicked any portfolio-management decisions regarding their biggest pot of savings to pension funds The transition to self-directed 401K retirement plans registered investment advisers and retail brokers was at first accompanied by wide trading spreads and meaty feesThen the adoption of new technologiessuch as computerised trading and wicked-fast marketmaking algorithmshelped erode spreads In 2013 Baiju Bhatt and Vlad Tenev Robinhood founders and former employees of marketmakers saw that it might be possible for a retail broker to make money by offering consumers commission-free stock trading It could instead earn revenues through “payment for order flow” This is the practice by which a high-frequency marketmaker pays a broker a cut of the spread it earns from trading in exchange for the broker directing its customers’ trades to the marketmakerFor a time the big retail brokers ignored the plucky upstart and continued to charge commissions and fees But by 2019 the writing was on the wall A quick brutal price war broke out Charles Schwab followed by E*Trade TD Ameritrade and eventually the biggest broker of all Fidelity succumbed scrapping their commissions and trading feesLower costs for investors are a laudable thing At Robinhood roadshow Mr Tenev claimed that his firm helped people buy shares in firms they love and got them excited about investing By Robinhood reckoning half of all brokerage accounts opened in America since 2015 have been set up on its platform But the broker has also been at the centre of unease about the retail revolution which peaked during the speculative frenzy in GameStop a struggling video-game retailer earlier this year The company share price spiked from $17 in January to more than $450 two weeks later So much of the trading volume came from retail investors and so much of it was directed through Robinhood that the broker was forced to suspend trading in GameStop because it lacked the capital to cover the two-day lag between its users’ trades and their settlementThe queasiness over Robinhood success stems from two sources For a start when the price of something falls people tend to do more of it According to data in the firm IPO filing around half of its users check their investments on its app every day But plenty of research papers find that the more people trade the worse their returns Another concern is that Robinhood exposes its users to risky products Its profit margins are slimmest for the vanilla stuff like stock trading but rise as its customers dabble in riskier more complicated markets such as trading derivatives or buying cryptocurrencies Although options and cryptocurrencies make up about 17% of the $80bn in assets that Robinhood oversees more than half of its transaction revenues come from these categories see chart 2These worries have led lawmakers to question whether retail investors stand to make any gains from Robinhood Summoned to Congress after the GameStop affair Mr Tenev claimed that its users had earned more than $35bn in profits by buying stocks and investments compared with what they had deposited with the broker But Jim Himes a congressman from Connecticut and a former banker skewered him “$35bn is a meaningless number unless you convert it to a rate of return so that I can compare it to Treasuries so I can compare it to the S&P 500” Mr Tenev deflected claiming the right comparison was the lower bar of “not investing at all” because many of Robinhood customers were new to tradingWhether the firm empowerment of retail investors has been desirable or not is more than a philosophical matter It is also the key question that any investor in Robinhood institutional or retail will have to wrestle with because it pertains to where the potential risks and rewards lie It is also a subject on which punters and regulators seem to disagreeThe downside for potential shareholders is that Robinhood is unlikely to escape the scrutiny of regulators Much of the broker 300-page prospectus discusses the main risks to its business These include the possible introduction of a financial-transaction tax which might scupper its ability to offer free trading and deter customers from trading every day It also allows for the possibility that payment for order flow which accounts for 80% of Robinhood revenues might be restricted or banned by regulatorsIndeed Gary Gensler the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission has said his agency is looking closely into whether the current market structure creates conflicts of interest The financial-services committee of the House of Representatives which hosted the GameStop hearing has drafted a bill that bans payment for order flowRetail punters however remain far more enthusiastic about Robinhood than regulators which provides potential investors with an upside It was common including in the pages of The Economist to expect that the GameStop episode could be the undoing of Robinhood; that its original adopters might feel betrayed by the firm suspension of trading in GameStop and junk the app But the company user numbers suggest that the adage “all publicity is good publicity” still holds In the first half of 2021 alone more than 10m funded trading accounts were opened on Robinhood boosting the total number of accounts by 80% If there is one constant about the retail mania it is its sheer unpredictability That might be why your correspondent feels comfortable with her single share content mainly to watch from the sidelines

 Jul 24th 2021,The private sector starts to invest in climate adaptation,“WE’RE GOING to make a lot of money” says Ken LaRoe chief executive of Florida Climate First Bank That might seem like an unseemly boast from a traditional banker peddling conventional loans But the lender aims to make its profits by financing green refrigeration construction retrofits and other investments designed to help borrowers adapt to climate change “Storm-hardening is getting to be a really big thing in Florida” Mr LaRoe reckons “which will be a nice lending opportunity for us”Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe need for such spending is clear The UN Environment Programme reckons that annual adaptation costs in poor countries alone are likely to rise from around $70bn today to $140bn-300bn in 2030 and twice that by 2050 in nominal terms It seems likely that private investors will have to get more involved According to the Climate Policy Initiative an expert body they contributed a paltry 2% to global adaptation spending in 2018 The apathy reflected among other things a lack of reliable data on climate risks and the perception that adaptation offers low returns But the mood could be shifting as Mr LaRoe enthusiasm suggestsThere is reason to think that investing in climate adaptation can pay off handsomely if only because not making such investments can cost companies A study in 2019 by BlackRock an asset manager argued that property will be especially badly hit by the impacts of climate change Beyond the immediate damage from storms and floods it pointed to costlier or reduced insurance coverage pricier energy costs of installing backup generators and other emergency systems and falling property prices in vulnerable areasIn hurricane-prone Florida a study of insurance data found that new buildings adhering to a stricter building code suffered far less damage yielding $350 in benefits for every dollar in extra compliance costs A recent report by the Global Commission on Adaptation GCA an NGO of worthies that include Bill Gates identified $18trn in investments that could deliver net benefits of $71trn by 2030It makes sense then that reinsurers are also banging the drum Swiss Re reckons it is far cheaper to invest ahead of climate disaster than to pay to fix it afterwards Boffins at Munich Re have co-written a recent paper showing that linking adaptation and insurance for example by restoring coral reefs that reduce the damage done by subsequent storms could lead to reduced premiums and a sixfold return on initial costs over 25 yearsThe trickle of investment into climate adaptation could turn into a torrent as companies are forced to disclose climate-related risks The EU is moving towards mandatory disclosure In America President Joe Biden issued an executive order in May along the same lines and the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to unveil a related proposal soonInvestors are paying more attention “If you are not protected against climate risk you are probably going to get lower financial returns in future” says Vivek Pathak of the International Finance Corporation the private-sector arm of the World Bank Natalie Ambrosio Preudhomme of Four Twenty Seven an advisory firm points to the emergence of resilience bonds the proceeds of which must go to climate adaptation as something that fits with “the investment strategies of many large institutional investors” An issuance in 2019 by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was oversubscribedResilience-focused investment funds are emerging too Sanjay Wagle co-founder of Lightsmith Group a private-equity firm is ploughing money into technologies such as geospatial imaging weather analytics and precision agriculture On July 19th Generate Capital an American sustainable infrastructure firm said it had raised $2bn Scott Jacobs its boss insists that “we do not accept lower returns for investments with resilience benefits” He points to his firm durable electric “microgrids” in Texas and California which kept the power flowing and continued to earn revenues during recent outages caused by freezing weather and wildfiresUtilities firms may prove to be keenest on resilience of them all Mr Wagle contrasts Pacific Gas & Electric a northern Californian utility driven to bankruptcy in large part by its failure to prepare for wildfires and weather-related shocks with Southern California Edison its flourishing southern counterpart that is spending more than $1bn a year on resilience BlackRock report analysed the climate exposure of 269 American utilities and found that the most resilient of them trade at a premium “We believe this premium could increaseas the risks compound and investors pay greater attention to the dangers” it concluded Adaptation

 Jul 24th 2021,Lessons from Britain on the balance between monetary and fiscal policy,NOWADAYS THE Bank of England like most rich-country central banks has two main functions: maintaining monetary stability and ensuring the soundness of the financial system For most of its life though it was also responsible for managing government debt Thankfully the original reason for the bank creation in 1694 to raise money for “carrying on the war against France” fell by the wayside That function was only hived off to the newly created Debt Management Office DMO in 1997 when the bank was given free rein over monetary policy But in the past decade the bank successive rounds of quantitative easing QE whereby it creates new money to buy bonds have left it holding more than a third of the government entire stock of debt That has awkwardly dragged it back into the realm of public-debt managementListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBritain ran a fiscal deficit of 143% of GDP in the latest financial year higher than in any peacetime year on record and comparable to the wartime borrowing of 1914-18 or 1939-45 The stock of government debt has risen from around 80% of GDP before covid-19 to 100% The pandemic is the second fiscal shock in little over a decade after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 As the experience of managing debt after war shows the divisions between fiscal and monetary policy can often become hazy in times of high public debt and wide deficits and especially so during crisesPolicy pick ‘n’ mixBritain government debt to GDP over the past century tells a dramatic but familiar story The huge borrowing of the two world wars is clearly visible as is the impact of the banking crisis and the pandemic Looking at servicing costs changes that dramatic narrative Despite a large increase in debt in the second world war the burden on taxpayers of servicing that debt fell compared with the 1920s In the latest financial year debt rose to its highest since the early 1960s but the ratio of interest costs to tax receipts dropped to new lows see chart Understanding the varying relationship between debt levels and interest costs means looking at how the functions of fiscal and monetary policy have varied over timeThe first world war may have ended in a military victory for Britain but it was also a fiscal disaster Interest rates rose enticing investors into buying gilts The 1917 War Loan a bond issued by the government came with a yield of 5% compared with a pre-war norm of under 3% This left a toxic legacy for the 1920s especially as much of the borrowing was short-term and left the Treasury exposed to rising interest rates Monetary policy in that decade was primarily concerned with returning sterling to the gold standard The result was higher interest rates than needed for domestic purposes which not only depressed demand and employment but added to soaring interest costs for the TreasuryThe fiscal crisis of the 1920s and 1930s cast a long shadow leading things to take a different course during the second world war John Maynard Keynes outlined his plans for a “three per cent war” The “business-as-usual” approach that had characterised the early years of the first world war was entirely absent in the second Monetary policy was made subservient to debt management and the purpose of the Bank of England became to help finance warDebt management remained central to monetary policy between the 1940s and the mid-1970s Interest rates were set with an eye on sustaining the public-debt burden and fiscal policy took the lead in trying to stabilise the economy Central banks were in other words subject to what economists call “fiscal dominance” Real interest rates were negative for more than half of the period 1945-80 thanks in part to high inflation A 2011 paper by Carmen Reinhart and Belen Sbrancia found that such financial repressiona combination of negative real rates with capital controls and the use of prudential powers to force domestic investors to hold public debtaccounted for most of the reduction in the debt ratio after 1945 Similar policies were pursued in America and much of EuropeOnly in the late 1970s and 1980s as concerns about inflation intensified did British monetary policy downplay the importance of debt management in setting interest rates By the late 1990s a new framework was in place Monetary policy set by an independent central bank would target inflation and stabilise the economy Debt management would be handled by the DMO For as long as the debt stock remained low this separation appeared to work wellThose low-debt days now seem like a distant memory however The question of the roles of monetary and fiscal policy therefore looms again Suborning monetary policy to fiscal needs can make managing public debt much less painful A spell of low or even negative real interest rates may well provoke fewer political problems than years of tight spending and high taxes But while austerity is not popular nor was the inflation that accompanied financial repression Independent central banks stabilised inflation expectations in the 1990s and 2000s That hard-won credibility would vanish if investors thought that helping the government meet its bills was the main job of monetary policyWorryingly some investors already seem to believe that the monetary-fiscal separation has broken down in Britain A survey by the Financial Times of the 18 largest gilt managers in January 2021 found that most believed that the main aim of QE was to lower government-borrowing costs Cynics note that monthly asset purchases by the Bank of England between April and December last year almost exactly tracked DMO issuance Andy Haldane the Bank of England departing chief economist warned in June of the risk of “fiscal dominance” On July 16th a House of Lords committee led by Lord Mervyn King a former governor of the Bank of England branded QE “a dangerous addiction” arguing that the trade-offs involved were only acceptable as a temporary measureThe fears are understandable The subordination of monetary policy to fiscal needs is not inevitable but history suggests that when debt is high the temptation will always be strong The central bank could do more to reassure investors that it is not bending to political pressure It could start by more openly setting out the rationale for QE and outlining its plans for an eventual exit

Flipkart was founded in 2007 by two software engineers who had worked at Amazon The e-commerce market was then wide open It isn’t anymore Amazon itself entered the Indian market in 2013 India old conglomerates have woken up to the fact that their consumer franchises might be upended by startups Reliance one of India big business groups has invested heavily in telecoms and broadband and has a large network of supermarkets Incumbency is an especially powerful force in Indian business With it comes the lobbying power to tilt regulations in your favourThat is not the only hole in the story India has a population that is similar in size to China But it is a lot poorer Average income per head is around $2000 in current prices compared with more than $10000 for China The average figure in India masks a hefty skew towards a wealthy elite The vast majority of India workforce is not in formal employment and earns far less than the average And despite the odd burst of impressive GDP growth India is not obviously on a path to follow China rapid economic development Its addressable market is a lot smallerIndia has undeniable strengths too of course Its computing and commercial talent makes it natural territory for venture capital The potential to spawn game-changing startups is there But the money flowing into venture capital worldwide is not really seeking originality Like a Hollywood producer it prefers to back variants of ideas that have already been hits India is a decent story but only a few will make decent money from it The numbers just don’t add up
 Jul 23rd 2021,What the Big Mac index says about the dollar and the dong,WHEN The Economist introduced its Big Mac index 35 years ago the ubiquitous McDonald hamburger cost just $160 in America Now it costs $565 according to an average of prices in four big cities The increase comfortably outstrips inflation over the same periodListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIndeed the Big Mac birthplace is one of the priciest places to buy it according to our comparison of over 70 countries around the world see chart In Vietnam for example the burger costs 69000 dong Although that sounds like an awful lot you can get a lot of dong for your dollar and therefore a lot of bang for your buck in Vietnam You can buy 69000 dong for only $3 on the foreign-exchange market And so a Big Mac in Vietnam works out to be 47% cheaper than in AmericaGood to know But the index was intended not as a shopper guide to burgers but as a tongue-in-cheek guide to currencies In principle the value of a currency should reflect its power to buy things according to the doctrine of “purchasing-power parity” a term coined by Gustav Cassel a Swedish economist in 1918 Since 69000 dong and $565 have the same power to buy a burger they should be worth the same amount The fact that you can buy a burger worth of dong for 47% less than a burger worth of dollars suggests the dong is undervaluedAmerica Treasury certainly thinks so Twice a year it reports to Congress on countries that might be keeping their currencies artificially cheap to boost exports and steal a competitive edge In April it confirmed that Vietnam was one of a trio of trading partners alongside Switzerland and Taiwan pursuing “potentially unfair” currency practices based on three tests of its devising Vietnam has a “significant” trade surplus with America a “material” external surplus with the world and its central bank buys a lot of dollars and other foreign currencies In recent months America Treasury has been browbeating Vietnam to mend its ways a process known as “enhanced engagement”On July 19th the two sides reached a deal Vietnam central bank promised not to indulge in competitive devaluation It also said it would gradually let the currency fluctuate more freely and it would be more open about its interventions in the currency markets With luck this will avert harmful tariffs or any similar enhancements of the two countries’ engagementLest the Big Mac index contribute to Vietnam difficulties it is worth pointing out that it is common for poor countries to seem cheap relative to rich ones in any simple comparison of prices Vietnam is not an outlier in this regard The price of a burger is about what you would expect given the country GDP per person Taiwan another country on the Treasury naughty step is a different case It remains surprisingly cheap given how prosperous it has become And Switzerland seems expensive by any measureThe cheapest burger we could find is in Lebanon Although the price of a Big Mac has increased spectacularly to 37000 Lebanese pounds the currency has collapsed even more dramatically on the black market where 22000 pounds buy a dollarAs a consequence the Big Mac costs the equivalent of only $168 One reason the burger has remained so cheap may be that Lebanese importers can purchase some of the Big Mac ingredients at a more favourable subsidised exchange rate They can buy a dollar worth of wheat for example for 1500 pounds and other foodstuffs including cheese at a rate of 3900 Lebanon currency chaos is both a reflection of its economic disaster and a contributor to it Even at an artificially low price a Big Mac is small consolation Correction February 2nd 2022: A previous version of the chart had incorrect data for the euro area Russia and Venezuela These have been updated Sorry
 Jul 22nd 2021,Are the Olympic games a bad deal for host cities?,SILENCE FILLS the official merchandise shop in Tokyo Aqua City mall just steps from the Olympic village It had hoped to do brisk business selling everything from T-shirts to traditional daruma dolls to hordes of fans But the pandemic means that the games which are due to open on July 23rd will proceed with little fanfare Sales are just 10% of what was projected the shop manager laments The outlook for the wider gains from the Olympics is similarly gloomybut covid-19 is only partly to blameEconomists have long argued that rather than consumption tourism and prestige the games leave high debt wasteful infrastructure and onerous maintenance obligations In a 2016 paper Victor Matheson and Robert Baade two American academics concluded that “in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities” The games this year offer plenty more grist for the sceptics’ mill “It would have been better not to have them” says Suehiro Toru of Daiwa Securities an investment bank expressing a sentiment common in Japan among economists and non-economists alikeCalculating the economic impact of mega-events like the Olympics can be tricky Organisers and critics argue over which costs are actually incurred by the games and which are investments cities would have undertaken anyway But one near-certainty is that the games blow the budget Alexander Budzier Bent Flyvbjerg and Daniel Lunn of Oxford University find that every Olympics since 1960 has overspent by an average of 172% in real terms The International Olympic Committee disputes their findings Tokyo fits the pattern In 2013 the price-tag for the games was $75bn By late 2019 the official budget had risen to $126bn and Japan audit board reckoned that the true cost was twice that Covid-19 countermeasures including the cost of testing and adapting venues have since added another $28bnA Tokyo government study in 2017 projected that the returns would more than make up for the costs It estimated that the games would generate ¥14trn $127bn of additional demand Part of the boost comes from the construction of new infrastructure though such projects can often crowd out investments in other more useful areas Another benefit usually comes from consumption around the games on everything from tickets to food and drink But as the competition will unfold without spectators Tokyo stands to reap little of thatMuch of the gain is expected to come from the woollier category of “legacy effects” such as increases in tourism and also the use of transport and other infrastructure after the tournament ends But those projections are probably overstated to begin with and the pandemic will erode much of them argues Miyamoto Katsuhiro of Kansai University Japan may still benefit from the extra hotels that it built reckons Kiuchi Takahide of the Nomura Research Institute; the supply of rooms was becoming a constraint on Japan growing tourism industry before the pandemic But others worry that the controversy around holding the games during a pandemic will create a negative legacy effect denting Japan international standing and making travellers less likely to visit Such concerns might explain why big sponsors such as Toyota say they will shun the opening ceremonyThe number of cities bidding for the games has dwindled in recent years Tokyo experience seems set only to put more of them off especially rich places with less need for infrastructure binges The Olympics may become a race no city wants to runFor more coverage of the Tokyo Olympics visit our dedicated  hub

As stimulus schemes put into place last year come to an end the question may soon be answeredWhen they first imposed lockdowns governments in the rich world introduced a raft of measures to support firms and households from doling out cheques and setting up furlough schemes to offering low-interest loans to firms and tax and rent holidays Many of these are now coming to an end or have done so already In the euro area at least three-quarters of debt holidays have expired In America half of states are abolishing a $300 weekly top-up to unemployment benefits in June and July; the rest follow in September A federal moratorium on evictions ends on July 31st Britain and Canada job-retention programmes end in the autumnTaken together these schemes have prevented much of the economic scarring usually seen after a recession That is not to say that many people have not suffered deprivation; global extreme poverty for instance has risen sharply Yet in the rich world overall family finances look surprisingly strong Real disposable income per person rose by 3% in 2020 even as GDP tanked see chart 1 Government spending on extra benefits and cash transfers which came to 23% of rich countries’ GDP undoubtedly helped In America the poverty rate rose only slightly from 107% in January 2020 to 11% in June this year albeit with fluctuations in betweenResilient household finances ensured robust demand for goods and services even in lockdown That plus a series of rescue measures means that firms too look unscathed In stark contrast to usual recessions business bankruptcies did not soar but fell sharply in most rich countries last year see chart 2The uncertainty now is how this picture will change once stimulus ends In a recent report the Bank for International Settlements a club of central bankers identified a “wave of firms’ insolvencies” as a “big question-mark clouding the outlook” There are three areas of concern: that reduced cash transfers cut people incomes and hit spending; that the end of furlough schemes puts millions out of work; and that deferred bills come due crimping spending or forcing bankruptciesConsider cash transfers first Just as unemployment insurance is becoming stingier in America Britain too is cutting its main welfare payment by £20 $27 a week Some people will surely reduce their outgoings as a resultYet overall spending need not suffer much Households in total have saved far more than normal see chart 3 Our analysis of OECD data puts “excess” savings across the club of mostly rich countries at $3trn worth a tenth of overall annual consumer spending The big worry about consumers in 2021 is not that an already large cash pile is no longer topped up but that people choose not to spend their savingsThe second concern relates to job-protection schemes Research by UBS a bank suggests that roughly 5% of employees in the four largest euro-area economies and Britain remain on these programmes If they cannot find work once the schemes end the average unemployment rate across the five countries will exceed the peak seen in the global financial crisisHere Australia offers hope Its job-retention scheme which a year ago was supporting 35m people ended in March Since then the unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest in a decade Nine out of ten people on the scheme have moved back into work As in many rich countries the problem in Australia is not an abundance of labour but a shortage The pandemic has created new demands and job vacanciesThe third concern is perhaps the most significantand is also the hardest to judge It relates to bills that are due but as yet unpaid from taxes and interest to rents The Bank of England financial-stability report notes that “businesses may face substantial repayments as VAT [valued-added tax] and rent deferrals begin to lapse” The extent of these is tricky to gauge Although companies rushed to borrow early in the pandemic indebtedness has grown less rapidly since But it is far from clear how company or national accounts treat overdue or deferred billsDebtors themselves may not know where they stand Non-payment of rent by American firms in 2020 “occurred privately and in a somewhat disorganised way” according to a paper by Goldman Sachs a bank leaving “lingering disagreements about whether rents have been truly abated or merely deferred” Estimates of the “back rent” owed by American households to their landlords vary by a factor of sixThe scale of the problem may be manageable in aggregate Take commercial rent in America Estimates of unpaid rent vary but a report by the city of San Francisco reckons that local businesses failed to pay up to $400m in the nine months to December Scaling that up as an inevitably rough guide suggests missed rent of about $30bn in America as a wholeabout 3% of annual commercial rents paid in a normal yearSo far the evidence suggests that bills are being largely repaid In Britain over 80% of households taking out deferrals on mortgage payments have since returned to full repayments suggesting many people may have made use of the scheme out of caution rather than need In the euro zone loans emerging from moratoriums have performed only slightly worse than the rest of banks’ loan books thus farBut as with so many things in the pandemic the likeliest outcome is that withdrawing stimulus will hit people at the bottom hardest Cutting welfare may push some into poverty and millions of renters in America could face eviction The least productive firms might go bust In 2020 governments were quick to launch universal generous stimulus schemes The task now is to scale those back and enable creative destruction while protecting those in need

 Jul 17th 2021,What does the ECB new target mean in practice?,FOR MOST of its 23 years of life the European Central Bank ECB had the fuzzy inflation target of “below but close to 2%” No one knew what precisely that meant but the consensus among economists was that the bank was aiming for inflation in the region of 17-19% In any case stubbornly low inflation rendered the question almost academic Average annual inflation in the euro area since 2013 has been just 09% compared with 19% in America even though interest rates are below zero and the ECB has hoovered up government and corporate bonds for years in an attempt to gin up the economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe bank struggle to attain its target has prompted some soul-searching Last year Christine Lagarde its president launched a review of its strategy which held “listening” events and pored over academic papers Its conclusions were announced on July 8th The bank plans eventually to incorporate the impact of climate change in its models and potentially to reflect climate considerations in its asset purchases It also intends to pay attention to the cost of owning a house when it studies inflation in contrast to practice in other rich countries this is not included in the euro area measure of consumer prices And it unveiled a new symmetric inflation target of 2%The greater clarity around the target is welcome and might ward off concerns that the ECB will raise interest rates before an economic recovery takes firm hold as it did in 2008 and 2011 Ms Lagarde noted on July 8th that the change won unanimous support from the bank 25-strong governing council But working out what it means for the ECB monetary policy may prove more contentiousFor a start the strategy seems to mean different things to different ratesetters Jens Weidmann the hawkish head of the Bundesbank and a member of the ECB governing council took pains to point out that although inflation might deviate from the target temporarily the ECB would not aim to exceed it That is in contrast to America Federal Reserve which also recently revised its target It plans to aim for inflation of 2% on average tolerating a period of overshooting in order to make up for past shortfalls But Olli Rehn the doveish governor of Finland central bank said on July 9th that he expected the ECB response to a shock to be quite similar to that of the FedThe different views might explain why although Ms Lagarde promised that the bank next monetary-policy meeting on July 22nd would clarify what the new target means for policy few analysts are expecting big changes The ECB is currently buying €80bn or $95bn in government and corporate bonds a month Economists at Barclays a bank reckon that the review should have no effect on the near-term path for monetary policy and that the ECB would continue to support the euro area by buying bonds Analysts at Morgan Stanley another bank predict that the ECB might bring forward an announcement to phase out its pandemic-related asset-purchase scheme but beef up an older purchase programme insteadWithout big changes it is hard to see how the ECB can do a better job of hitting its target In June a range of economic forecasters including those at the central bank projected inflation to be in the region of 14-15% in 2023 If it is to successfully convince investors and households that it means business then the bank will have to explain why when it does not expect even to meet its old target it should suddenly be able to hit its new one 
 Jul 15th 2021,Investment in fintech booms as upstarts go mainstream,AN AIR OF hype habitually surrounds the founders of startups and their venture-capital backers: everyone is an evangelist for their latest project But even allowing for that zeal something astonishing is going on in fintech Much more money is pouring into it than usual In the second quarter of the year alone it attracted $34bn in venture-capital funding a record reckons CB Insights a data provider see chart 1 One in every five dollars invested by venture capital this year has gone into fintechListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDeals are also proceeding at a frenetic pace PitchBook another data provider reckons that venture-capital firms have sold $70bn in stakes in fintech startups so far this year nearly twice as much as in all of 2020 itself a bumper year see chart 2 That included 32 listings Fintechs took part in 372 mergers in the first quarter including 21 of $1bn or moreIn the past few weeks alone Visa a credit-card firm has paid €18bn $21bn for Tink a Swedish payments platform JPMorgan Chase America largest bank has said it will buy OpenInvest which provides sustainable-investment toolsits third fintech acquisition in six months Upstarts such as Raisin and Deposit Solutions two German platforms that link banks with savers are merging Some are going public On July 7th a listing in London valued Wise a money-transfer firm at nearly £9bn $122bn Recent or planned multi-billion initial public offerings IPOs include that of Marqeta a debit-card firm Robinhood a no-fee broker and SoFi an online lenderThis blizzard of activity reflects demand from investors as they hunt for returns and as the digital surge in finance takes off But it also reveals something more profound Once the insurgents of finance fintech firms are becoming part of the establishmentThe current investment boom has several novel features beyond its scale For a start it is increasingly focused on the biggest firms says Xavier Bindel of JPMorgan Smaller me-toos and startups with business models that have struggled during the pandemic are no longer in favour The first quarter of 2021 saw the most funding rounds ever for private fintech startups valued above $100m; the median round raised $10m a quarter more than in the same period last yearThe location of activity has changed too Five years ago the fintech story centred on America and China Today Europe is catching up A funding round in June valued Klarna a Swedish “buy now pay later” startup at $46bn making it the second-most-valuable private fintech firm in the West Only July 15th Revolut a London-based neobank said it had raised $800m valuing it at $33bn Firms in Latin America and Asia and led by Stanford-educated or Silicon-Valley-trained founders in particular have become magnets for investors Nubank Brazil biggest digital-only bank for instance is worth $30bnThe craze also extends beyond payments A surge in savings in rich countries in the past year has boosted “wealth-tech” startups such as online brokers and investment advisers Insurance-tech firms received $18bn through 82 deals globally in the first quarter of this year Lending has proved trickier to disruptperhaps owing to regulators’ firmer grip on this area of financeexcept when it crosses over into payments as illustrated by the rise of Klarna and its rivalsThis broadening out points to one explanation for the explosion in funding: the huge growth in the market for fintech offerings during the pandemic Consumers and companies adjusted with rapidity and ease to the closure of bank branches and shops and the resulting digitisation of commerce and finance Many of their new habits are likely to stickFactors specific to fintech are also behind the big bang Most of today fintech stars are not overnight successes but were set up in the early 2010s Since then their user numbers have swollen to the many millions and they are approaching profitability They have become big enough to appear on the radar screens of late-stage venture-capital and private-equity firms such as America-based TCV which has backed Trade Republic a German variant of Robinhood Japan SoftBank a recent investor in Klarna and Sweden EQT which backed Mollie a Dutch payments firm last monthMoreover some institutional investorssuch as asset managers BlackRock sovereign-wealth funds Singapore GIC and pension funds Canada Pension Plan Investment Boardhave made a lot of money by snapping up shares in big tech firms in recent years These are now trying to gain an edge by investing in promising startups before they go publicThe huge cheques from these investors come just as fintech firms are hoping to write the next chapter Most startups were created to “unbundle” finance: to carve out niches where they could offer a better service than the banks Now however most successful firms are rebundling adding new products in a bid to become platforms Acquisitions provide a handy shortcut; their high valuations mean the big firms can often snap up smaller ones on the cheap by swapping equityStripe the most valuable private fintech firm in the West is a good example of the sector coming of age It was set up a decade ago to help firms accept payments online Now worth $95bn it also offers services ranging from tax compliance to fraud prevention That breadth was partly achieved through acquisitions; since October it has bought three other firmsA similar logic animates credit-card giants which are trying to hedge against innovations in online payments; and the banks which see fintech as a way to plug gaps in their digital offerings cut costs and diversify away from lending Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are bringing lots of smaller acquisitions under the umbrella of new versatile consumer apps As a consequence the distinction between fintech and traditional banking could eventually blur predicts Nik Milanovic of Google Pay the tech firm payments armSwipe rightAll this splurging and merging also carries risks One is that the hefty prices paid for fintechs prove unjustified Visa is buying Tink at a price that is 60 times the startup annual revenue; Wise is valued at around 20 times its revenues and 285 times its profits Banks in particular may find out about promising fintech firms only once they are too expensiveAnother risk is that competition and innovation are stifled Founders of startups that have been acquired often leave at the end of their “vesting” periodthe minimum amount of time they must stick around before they can sell their shares usually one to three years The culture that allowed a firm to thrive could then wither Fintechs bought by banks in particular could struggle: after a deal cultures can clash; customers often leave Most neobanks acquired by old ones such as Simple bought by BBVA a Spanish bank have been either shut down or soldNevertheless one thing seems clear Fintechs are inexorably gaining critical mass: their value has risen to $11trn equivalent to 10% of the value of the global banking and payments industry and up from 4% in 2018 Prices may be stretched today and some firms may flop but in the long run it seems likely that this share will only rise further A version of this article was published online on July 12th 2021
 Jul 15th 2021,The EU proposes a carbon tariff on some imports,WHEN THE European Union established its cap-and-trade scheme for pricing carbon emissions in 2005 it faced a tricky design problem Making polluting firms buy permits puts them at a disadvantage in global markets Companies might respond to the scheme by moving their dirty activities offshore causing “carbon leakage” And if producers in places with lax environmental standards outcompeted European firms global emissions would go up The EU solved the problem by offering subsidies and free pollution permits to some dirty industries exposed to tradeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThose handouts however have always had a target on their back On July 14th EU officials set out a plan to phase them out and replace them with a “carbon border-adjustment mechanism” CBAM Between 2025 and 2035 producers of aluminium cement fertilisers and steel will gradually lose their subsidies But importers of these goods will have to buy a new category of pollution permit How many they need will depend on the amount of carbon estimated to have been emitted during the production of the goods The policy is in effect a tariff intended to compensate for the fact that foreign firms may face no carbon price or one that is lower than EuropeThe switch will please those who suspect that subsidies have blunted the impact of carbon prices In theory free permits do not affect the incentive to reduce emissions because at the margin the financial reward for doing so is the same: firms that get greener can sell their surplus entitlements In practice the freebies have sapped ambition Michael Grubb of University College London points out that companies know that if they sell their permits today they might receive fewer handouts in future Compared with the industries that have received support the power sector which has not has decarbonised more quickly Victoria Irving of Morgan Stanley a bank says that some subsidised polluters have made green investments but “they have a long way to go” Withdrawing the subsidies without a new scheme would bring back the danger of leakageOfficials estimate that by 2030 the CBAM and the suite of environmental policies announced alongside it will reduce emissions in the affected sectors by 14% compared with a scenario in which nothing changes However imports would be 12% lower because tariffs depress trade Though totemic the scheme scope is relatively small It would raise about €9bn in revenues in 2030 although that figure may nearly double once the policy is fully phased in The carbon embodied in trade flows is typically less than 10% of countries’ total emissions according to the IMF and the proposal covers only a handful of sectors In 2019 the imports in question were worth only €29bn $33bn or 15% of total trade in goods for the blocTariffs do not have to be large however to provoke a response Perhaps it will be a good one: with the CBAM in place foreign countries might as well price carbon at home and keep the revenue for themselves the EU will grant discounts for carbon taxes already paid As the scope of the CBAM increases so will other governments feel a greater pull towards pricing emissions A more likely consequence however is a brawl over whether the policy is protectionist Australia and India both exporters to the EU are already grumbling that the tariff could be discriminatory and regressive In March America warned the EU that border levies should be a “last resort” It has also said it is considering one of its own despite not pricing carbon itself other than through an incomplete patchwork of state schemes in which prices are too lowThere is also a danger of unintended consequences Foreign companies could redirect their greenest exports to Europe and send their dirtiest output elsewhere rather than cutting overall emissions This phenomenon dubbed “resource shuffling” has troubled California which has a CBAM for its electricity marketthe only existing comparable scheme Firms could also adjust their supply chains to exploit the limited scope of the policy A carmaker that would have to buy permits to import steel may prefer to buy a car chassis made with steel overseas to which the CBAM would not applyThe risk of such carbon leakage rises in tandem with the carbon price A study published in January by DIW Berlin a think-tank found that a price of €75 per tonne would leave as much as 15% of the EU manufacturing vulnerable to being undercut in this way European carbon prices are hovering between €50-60 per tonne and projected to increaseSteel yourselfThese problems however will be reduced to the extent that carbon prices are adopted everywhere The power of incentives means carbon-intensive production will always try to find its way to where emissions are cheap but that does not mean it is futile to try to plug all the holes The best argument for the CBAM is that it is a first step towards a world in which emissions cannot escape carbon prices Were they sufficiently widespread the CBAM would be rendered unnecessaryLong before that happens though the EU must overcome opposition to the CBAM at home One problem is that trade will be adjusted on the way in but not on the way out Exporters having lost their subsidies will still find themselves competing in markets outside Europe borders against firms that can ignore the cost of carbon Around 8% of the EU cement production and 18% of steel is exported Already some lawmakers in the European Parliament which must approve the proposal are calling for border adjustment to exist alongside free permits punishing foreigners while continuing to shield those at home Bowing to them would turn a potentially useful policy for fighting climate change into naked protectionismand an instructive example for

central bankers are mentioning inequality more often see chart The latest annual economic report by the Bank for International Settlements BIS the central banks’ bank devotes a whole chapter to the distributional effects of monetary policyIn the past central banks would argue that inequality was primarily the result of structural forces automation say or globalisation that lie beyond their mandate or their power They have only one policy instrument they would point out They cannot set different benchmark interest rates for rich and for poor And their workhorse economic models often featured a single “representative” household that was meant to stand in for everyone A model will struggle to assess a policy impact on the distribution of income if there is in effect only one household to distribute toIn keeping with this tradition the BIS warns its members not to overreach Central banks best serve the cause of combating inequality by sticking to their traditional goals of curbing inflation downturns and financial excess Tacking on inequality as another objective could compromise the achievement of these aims Monetary policy will find it harder to fight cyclical forces if it is too busy flailing against structural forces such as technology and tradeMoreover the age-old fight against inflation recession and speculation is not necessarily inegalitarian High inflation is often a regressive tax harming those who rely on cash the most “[I have] seen first-hand the havoc that high inflation can wreak on the poorer segments of society when I grew up in Argentina” said Claudio Borio of the BIS in a recent speech Fighting downturns is also an egalitarian endeavour Recessions worsen inequality and inequality worsens recessions in a cycle of “perverse amplification” as Mr Borio puts it Deeply divided societies suffer larger drops in output in bad times and respond more slowly to monetary easing The effect of policy on the economy is impaired partly because the very poor cannot access credit and therefore cannot borrow and spend more when interest rates are cut Meanwhile the very rich do not spend much more either even though looser policy pushes up the prices of their assetsThere is then no need to give central banks a new more egalitarian set of goals But that leaves open the question of how central banks should meet those goals Some approaches and tools may be better for social cohesion than others And central banks might reasonably favour those that all else equal serve their mandate more equitably than othersThe Fed for example last year adopted a less trigger-happy interpretation of its inflation target A side-effect of this approach should be lower income inequality It will allow the Fed to find out whether people on the economic sidelines can become employable if hiring remains strong enough for long enough To guide their thinking central banks are turning to economic models that include “heterogeneous” households a step beyond the “representative-agent New Keynesian” model otherwise known as RANK They also now have a bewildering variety of tools to choose from Some buy equities which are largely held by the rich Others provide cheap funding to banks that lend to small firms The Bank of Japan does both Each tool will make a different contribution both to the level of spending and the distribution of incomeA tool of the manyYet there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve Even a central bank that sticks to its customary role the BIS notes may face awkward trade-offs pitting income inequality against wealth inequality and inequality now versus inequality later Bold monetary easing may lead to a more uniform distribution of income by preserving jobs But it will boost the price of assets increasing wealth inequality at least in the short run In addition these expansive monetary policies can the BIS argues contribute to financial excesses that could go on to result in a deeper more protracted recession in the future And that would ultimately be bad even for income equalityThe BIS answer is to bring a wider range of policies to bear including better financial regulation to curb speculative excesses and more responsive fiscal policy where public finances permit By spending more governments allow central banks to buy less Ben Bernanke a former Fed chair much maligned by populist critics put it this way: “If fiscal policymakers took more of the responsibility for promoting economic recovery and job creation monetary policy could be less aggressive”If central banks have worsened inequality in their efforts to rescue the economy it is partly because they have borne an unequal share of the job With more help from fiscal policy central banks will find it easier to take away the punch bowl before the tea party gets going 
 Jul 10th 2021,Why convertible bonds are the asset class for the times,IN THE MIDDLE of March last year as the coronavirus pandemic was taking hold a private-equity boss in America was asked how his industry would deal with the shock The businesses owned by buyout firms would first look to raise debt wherever and however they could Drawing equity from private-equity investors would be a last resort “I think you’ll see the same in public marketsa lot of convertible issues” he said Sure enough there was soon a rash of big convertible-bond sales by cruise lines airlines and retailersListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA convertible is a bond with an option to swap for shares of common equity Last year $159bn-worth were issued worldwide according to figures compiled by Calamos Investments an asset manager This was around twice the value of convertibles issued in 2019 So far this year around $100bn-worth have been issued An asset class that had fallen out of fashion is back in vogue That is because convertibles are well-suited to fast-changing conditionsTo understand why start with some basics A convertible bond has the usual features of a garden-variety bond: a principal to be repaid on maturity an interest-rate coupon paid once or twice a year and so on In addition the issuer grants the bondholder the right to convert the principal into a fixed number of shares This number known as the conversion rate is typically set so that it would be worthwhile to exercise the option only if the share price rose by 30-40% The option is thus “out of the money” when the convertible is issued A company with a share price of say $15 might set the conversion rate of a $1000 bond at 50 At that rate it would begin to make economic sense to swap the bond for equity only if the share price reached $20 ie $1000 divided by 50 In exchange for the equity option convertibles pay a lower rate of interest A rule of thumb is that they have a coupon roughly half that of a regular bondConvertibles may be complex securities but in some circumstances they have clear advantages over straight debt or equity for both issuers and investors This is the case for unproven firms in capital-hungry businesses Until recently Tesla was a big issuer of convertibles for instance The founders of such firms are often reluctant to issue equity because it dilutes their ownership They would prefer to issue debt But bond investors might demand a steep interest rate to compensate for the risk of default Convertible bonds can be an ideal compromise Investors are willing to accept a lower interest rate in exchange for a piece of the equity upside For business owners convertibles are less dilutive than straight equity New shares are issued later at a much higher price if at allAround 60% of the volume of issues so far this year is by firms that have been listed for less than three years says Joseph Wysocki of Calamos But old-economy cyclical firms are issuers too Some like Carnival Cruises and Southwest Airlines used convertibles last year to raise “rescue” finance at lower interest rates and without immediate dilution Others are using them to finance investment: Ford Motor sold $2bn of convertible bonds in March for instanceThis flurry of issuance is quite a shift The market for convertibles was previously rather moribund even as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans enjoyed a boom The absence of meaningful inflation meant that long-term interest rates steadily fell Bond investors enjoyed healthy capital gains At an aggregate level the trend in American corporate finance was to swap equity for debt and not the other way roundToday challenges are different A big concern is that inflation and interest rates are at the start of an upward trend A world of high inflation would be a trickier one in which to raise capital by issuing corporate bonds The nominal value of the bond at redemption would be a lot lower in real terms By contrast convertible bonds offer some protection They are “nominal assets which come with an embedded call option on a real asset” writes Dylan Grice of Calderwood Capital an alternative-investment boutique The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer pricesConvertibles have already proved their worth They were almost tailor-made for the circumstances of spring 2020 Big changes call for flexible forms of capital And it is easy to imagine further economic dislocations on the horizon Convertibles are the asset class for the times
 Jul 10th 2021,The uneasy partnership between private equity and SPACs,THE SPECTACLE of the SPAC or “special-purpose acquisition company” has preoccupied bankers on Wall Street over the past year This is in part because the vehicles which list a shell company on stockmarkets and raise a pot of capital before hunting for a private company to merge with are often touted by their backers as an alternative to an initial public offering IPO Big banks make meaty fees from their IPO businesses For some the fact that SPACs have muscled in is an unwelcome development As voracious buyers of private firms though SPACs are attracting as much attention among the private-equity PE barons on New York Park Avenue as on Wall StreetListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSince the start of 2020 SPACs have gobbled up almost $200bn in capital The way they are constructed makes them prone to overpaying for firms Creators see no compensation unless they strike a deal with a merger target which must often be done within two years The founders’ payoff is usually 20% of the shares the SPAC helps issue in the newly public firm which are given to them for a nominal fee This means that even if the shares plunge after the shell company merges with its target the founders are still well compensated Their incentive is thus to do any deal they can at lofty prices if necessaryThis tendency to overpay is both a blessing and a curse for PE If a PE firm is looking to offload one of its portfolio companies then finding a SPAC to buy it is an attractive prospect In March Blackstone and CVC Capital Partners two PE shops tripled their money when they sold Paysafe a payments platform through a SPAC merger led by Bill Foley an insurance executive After Blackstone achieved record first-quarter earnings of $175bn Jon Gray its president noted on an earnings call that SPACs had emerged as a new exit optionBut PE firms also need to purchase private companies for their new funds ideally at low valuations if they are to make the juicy returns their investors have come to expect Little is known publicly about the deals that PE firms miss out on but reports abound of SPACs bidding 20-50% more for companies than the most optimistic valuations by analysts in PE shopsA further complication in the relationship between blank-cheque vehicles and PE is that some PE giants are setting up SPACs themselves Apollo for instance has launched five in recent years That could pose a dilemma: should a target firm be bought through the private arm to the benefit of the investors in the PE fund or by the public arm to the benefit of the investors in the SPAC? The SPAC frenzy might yield juicy returns for PE investors who bought into a fund a decade ago But tricky choices loom

 Jul 8th 2021,Central banks face a daunting task: tapering without the tantrum,Editor note July 6th 2021: This article has been updated to reflect the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to taper its bond-buying in SeptemberTHE DEBATE over the effect on markets and the global economy of quantitative easing QE the purchase of bonds with newly created money is almost akin to a culture war To its critics unrestrained QE during the pandemic has covertly financed governments while inflating asset prices and boosting inequality To its fans QE is an essential tool in which economists have justified and growing confidence This high-stakes debate is about to enter a new phase Rich-world central banks’ balance-sheets will have grown by $117trn during 2020-21 projects JPMorgan Chase a bank see chart 1 By the end of this year their combined size will be $28trnabout three-quarters of the market capitalisation of the S& P 500 index of stocks today But central bankers are about to turn this mega-tanker of stimulus aroundListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe justifications for QE have almost dissipated At the start of the pandemic central banks bought bonds to calm panicky markets amid a flight to safety and a dash for cash Then it became clear that the pandemic would cause a huge economic slump that would send inflation plummeting; QE was needed to stimulate the economy Today however markets are jubilant and inflation is resurgentIn America it looks increasingly weird that the Federal Reserve is the biggest buyer of Treasuries as it was in the first quarter of 2021 The economy is powering ahead In June it added a heady 850000 jobs according to figures released on July 2nd On Wall Street cash is so abundant that over $750bn gets parked at the New York Fed reverse-repo facility most nights mopping up some of the liquidity injected by QE On June 30th it absorbed nearly $1trn The Fed purchases of mortgage-backed securities given America red-hot housing market now look bizarreSome central banks have already begun to scale back their purchases The Bank of Canada began curtailing the pace of its bond-buying in April The Reserve Bank of Australia said on July 6th that it would begin tapering its purchases in September The Bank of England is approaching its £895bn $12trn asset-purchase target and looks likely to stop QE once that is reached; Andrew Bailey its governor has mused about offloading assets before raising interest rates contrary to the normal sequencing In May the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it would not make all of the NZ$100bn $70bn asset purchases it had planned to And the European Central Bank is debating how to wind down its pandemic-related schemeBy comparison the Fed has been reticent Last month Jerome Powell the Fed chair said that the central bank is “talking about talking about” tapering its purchases of assets Minutes of the meeting preceding his comments released on July 7th revealed that officials thought it “important to be well-positioned” to taper Most economists expect an announcement by the end of the year The Fed careful approach might reflect lingering memories of 2013 when it last warned of tapering to come Bonds sold off sharply the dollar soared and emerging markets suffered capital outflows in what is now known as the “taper tantrum” Even Mr Powell announcement in June was accompanied by a mini-tantrum of sorts Prompted by higher inflation officials also indicated that they expected to raise interest rates twice by the end of 2023 sooner than they had previously signalled The hawkish turn sent emerging-market currencies tumblingQE is swathed in so much mystical uncertainty that working out the impact of unwinding it is no easy feat But a careful examination of central banks’ past experience of asset purchases yields clues for what to expect It also contains lessons for how central banks might be able to extricate themselves from their bond-buying gracefully this time before the negative side-effects of their enormous balance-sheets start to be felt acutelyBegin with the effects of changing course Everyone agrees that central banks’ asset purchases reduce long-term bond yields But there is enormous uncertainty as to how much they underpin markets today Last year Ben Bernanke the Fed chairman at the time of the taper tantrum suggested that in America in 2014 every $500bn of QE reduced ten-year Treasury yields by 02 percentage points By that rule of thumb adjusted for inflation the Fed total securities holdings of $75trn today are lowering yields by nearly three percentage points though Mr Bernanke suggested somewhat arbitrarily that the overall effect of QE might be capped at 12 percentage pointsAlternatively the median estimate of a survey of 24 studies conducted in 2016 by Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests that asset purchases worth 10% of GDP reduced ten-year government bond yields by about half a percentage point That suggests that QE today is suppressing long-term rates by just under two percentage points in America Britain and the euro areaalthough Mr Gagnon argues that when yields approach zero as they have in Europe and Japan QE reaches its limits A bigger bond market may also reduce the size of the effect The Bank of Japan owns government debt worth a staggering 97% of GDP but Mr Gagnon finds the effects of QE have historically been more muted perhaps because Japan total public debt is more than two-and-a-half times that figureThese numbers and the experience of the taper tantrum make the reversal of QE seem like something that will upend financial markets Sky-high asset prices today reflect the assumption that long-term interest rates will stay low for a long time “We know we need to be very careful in communicating about asset purchases” Mr Powell acknowledged earlier this year Yet the lessons from the taper tantrum are subtler than they seemand may even provide some cause for comfortWhen the toys go out of the pramThe tantrum of 2013 is associated with Mr Bernanke raising the subject of slowing the Fed pace of asset purchases But asset prices fell because investors brought forward the date at which they expected the Fed to raise overnight interest rates the traditional lever of monetary policy The episode supports the “signalling” theory of QE which says that central banks’ balance-sheets influence long-term bond yields not directly as rules of thumb suggest but by acting as a marker for future interest rates The implication is that you can reverse QE without much fuss if you sever the perceived link between asset purchases and interest-rate decisionsSome past episodes of tapering seem to observe this rule Indeed the Fed has already achieved a big tapering during the covid-19 crisis As the severity of the pandemic became clear and markets panicked in spring 2020 the Fed hoovered up almost $15trn of Treasuries in just two months before dramatically slowing its purchases which eventually settled at around $80bn a month But there was no expectation that interest rates would soon rise and bond yields seemed unaffected In a speech Gertjan Vlieghe of the Bank of England a proponent of the signalling theory cited this experience which was mirrored in Britain as evidence that there is little mechanical link between bond yields and QEThe Fed also seemed to achieve such a separation the last time it shrank its balance-sheet significantly in 2018 and 2019 It let assets mature without reinvesting the proceeds rather than by selling anythingwith no discernible effect on bond yields “The point around signalling and intent is a very salient feature of how QE operates” says a trader at a big Wall Street bank Since the end of March ten-year Treasury yields have drifted down even as tapering talk has become louderPerhaps then central banks can pull off a graceful exit The question is whether rising inflation and booming markets will make them impatient to reverse course more abruptly Some particularly in Britain are also wary of three potential undesirable effects of central banks’ balance-sheets being too large for too longThe first concern which has troubled Mr Bailey is about preserving ammunition A popular view is that QE is highly effective at calming markets during crises when it is deployed quickly and at scale but has smaller effects in more normal times The danger of prolonging an enormous market presence in good times is that you run out of room to act with force during emergencies Central bankers usually scorn this logic when it is used to argue for higher interest rates because harming the economy today to rescue it later is to put the cart before the horse But if QE works best in a crisis then withdrawing it in normal times should not be so painful Not doing so might mean a gradual ratcheting up during each crisis of the share of government debt that central banks ownThe second worry is the unseemly tangle of monetary and fiscal policy that QE creates During the pandemic central banks have routinely faced the accusation that QE is meant to fund governments; in January a survey by the Financial Times of the 18 biggest investors in Britain gilt market found that the “overwhelming majority” thought the purpose of the Bank of England bond-buying was to finance the government emergency spending rather than to support the economyBut although lower bond yields help the government finances QE does not extinguish the government financing costs It just shifts them to central banks whose profits and losses end up back with the taxpayer The central-bank reserves created to buy bonds carry a floating rate of interest making them analogous to short-term government borrowing Over the past decade issuing short-term liabilities to buy long-term debt has been a profitable strategy Between 2011 and 2020 the Fed sent over $800bn in profits to the Treasury; the Bank of England asset-purchase facility transferred £109bn to British taxpayersIf interest rates rose however central banks’ enormous balance-sheets could become lossmaking That could have sizeable consequences for the public finances: in November 2020 Britain Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the country debt-service costs had become twice as sensitive to short-term interest rates as they were at the start of the year as a result of the combination of QE and increased debt Every one-percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates will raise the annual cost of servicing debt by 05% of GDP by 2025-26 In large rich countries 15–45% of public debt is “in effect overnight” calculates the Bank for International Settlements Some economists also worry that central banks could see their independence compromised were they to require cash injections from governmentsThe final factor is appearances The prominence of central banks’ holdings of public debt has helped create a widespread impression that governments can spend with abandon It has had weird effects such as sending measures of the broad money supply through the roof contributing to fears of inflation Politicians eye central banks ever more greedily wanting to use QE to further goals such as reducing inequality or fighting climate change During times of economic crisis central bankers have to lead from the front As normality returns their focus should be on keeping a lower profile Dig deeperThe new fault lines on which the world economy rests July 2021Will surprisingly high levels of inflation last?

 Jul 7th 2021,The Saudi-Emirati rift within OPEC is a sign of things to come,IT IS RARE for spats about oil supply to break out between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates UAE The countries’ views on output usually align Traders and analysts regard them along with Kuwait as the core of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC So eyebrows were raised in early July when Suhail Al Mazrouei the UAE energy minister told reporters that OPEC quotas were “totally unfair” A further surprise came on July 5th when meetings between the cartel and its allies notably Russia together known as OPEC+ were abandoned because of the row The price of the benchmark Brent crude rose above $77 a barrel for the first time in more than two years before dropping back below $75; that of American crude briefly hit a six-year highListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOPEC+ introduced swingeing production cuts last spring as covid-19 began to spread the demand for fuel tanked and the oil price collapsed to below $30 per barrel More recently the cartel has been carefully increasing supply as demand has revived and oil prices have recovered The cancelled meeting had been convened with the goal of agreeing on further increases to output after July At the same time the Saudis and others were also seeking to extend the current regime for assigning cuts to members’ productionBut the UAE wants the quotas which are based on countries’ oil-producing potential in October 2018 to be revised Its supply capacity has grown by almost a fifth since then thanks to heavy investment A third of its production is now sitting idlea greater share than in any other OPEC+ country see chartOther members in particular Saudi Arabia are reluctant to see production rise too much however That is partly because giving way on quotas could mean that countries such as Russia start to make similar demands But it could also reflect the Saudis’ desire to avoid overproduction at a time when non-OPEC producers may expand supply tooThe usual suspects would have been America shale producers who in the past have often increased output when oil prices rise This time may be different though The industry is trying to change its ways promising to keep a tight rein on oil output restrain investment and return cash to shareholdersIran is a more likely source of new supply The country negotiators are trying to strike a deal with America that would lift economic sanctions in return for limits on its nuclear ambitions If they succeed Iran could add around 1m barrels a day to the market by the end of the year; it could also sell the 200m barrels it currently has in storage Chris Midgley of S&P Global Platts a data firm points out that Saudi officials do not want a replay of 2018 when America decision not to reimpose oil sanctions on Iran took them by surprise and sent oil prices lurching downwardsWhat then to expect from the cartel and its allies? There are three scenarios One is that countries start producing whatever they want a price war ensues and oil prices tumble Analysts reckon that this is the least likely outcome Energy ministers still bear the scars of the ill-timed price war of March 2020 when Russia and Saudi Arabia failed to agree on production cuts The market was flooded with oil just before demand suffered its covid-induced collapseAnother possibility is that a new deal fails to be struck and that countries stick to their current quotas That would mean the extra post-July production increases that the market had been expecting do not materialise Coupled with a summer uptick in demand from holidaymakers as they fly or drive to their destinations that would push prices up perhaps over $80 a barrel The most likely outcome from the row however is a compromise One possibility is that the UAE and some other countries are allowed a temporary increase in output and the thorny issue of quota revision is kicked down the roadEven if a deal is struck however the spat may portend further disagreementsand more price volatility OPEC+ members are using divergent strategies when it comes to the energy transition and the oil markets argues Francesco Martoccia of Citigroup a bank Faced with dwindling demand in the long term some producers such as the UAE want to boost supply and monetise petroleum reserves earlier Others such as Saudi Arabia want to restrict production to keep prices high Such divisions will become even clearer as the shift towards a greener economy accelerates OPEC latest tiff won’t be its last A version of this article was published online on July 7th 2021
 Jul 3rd 2021,Stubborn optimism about China economy,PICTURE THE moment of confusion in a taxi in Guiyang a city in south-western China Your columnist had asked the driver to go to the new district “The new new district or the old new district?” he asked It was it emerged the old new districta place that seven years ago on an earlier visit to Guiyang had looked like the sort of ghost town then dominating horror stories about China economy full of giant empty buildings This time however the problem was the exact opposite What was meant to be a quick jaunt turned into a traffic-clogged headache the taxi crawling along in a sea of red tail lights The old new district had filled in and then someListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not

helps breed humility Assumptions that once appeared iron-clad gather rust as the years roll by That is true for most places But it is especially so when covering something as complex as China economy which your columnist had the privilege to do over the past decadeThis to be clear is not a mea culpa for being overly gloomy There were also times of excess optimism about China capacity for change Take rebalancing As far back as 2007 Wen Jiabao then China prime minister decried its economy as “unstable unbalanced”evidence it seemed that leaders grasped the problem and were ready to act Yet the economy only became more unstable culminating in a nearly epic meltdown in 2015 And it is as unbalanced as ever with investment running far ahead of consumption Nevertheless it is hard to escape the conclusion that in the economic realm China got more right than wrong over the past decade How else to score its performance when despite many predictions of doom it doubled in size during that time?A common riposte is that this success is illusorythat the government has simply delayed the comedown from its debt-fuelled high The deferral of pain is certainly part of the mix Perhaps the safest bet in economics is that when growth slows sharply China will unveil yet more infrastructure projects and call on banks to make still more loans And if those projects or loans fail officials have few qualms about orchestrating bail-outs and roll-oversWhat is less appreciated is that China ability to engage in such engineering is itself a measure of success The government can lean on its banks because they are enormously profitable to begin with The telltale signs of an overdrawn economyhigh inflation rampant unemployment and corporate malaiseexist in pockets in China but they are the exception not the ruleThis point was driven home when your columnist moved from Beijing to Shanghai in 2014 Each city has its charms but Shanghai unquestionably offers a more flattering picture of the economy Beijing a showcase for political power is blotted by the hulking headquarters of state-owned enterprises Day trips take reporters to China greatest economic calamities from overbuilt Tianjin to coal-mine carnage in Inner Mongolia In Shanghai which functions remarkably well for a city of 25m reporters instead hop over to see high-tech innovators in Hangzhou nimble exporters in Wuxi and ambitious entrepreneurs in Wenzhou They show that even as the tenth year of Xi Jinping rule approaches two of the fundamental underpinnings of China economic dynamism remain intact: red-blooded competition in the private sector and the restless quest of millions upon millions of ordinary people to improve their lot in lifeThese days saying nice things about China economy comes with baggage not least because of the Communist Party insistence that its growth record is proof of its superior political system It is true that the government has had a crucial hand in the country development starting with the fact that it has been “Infrastructure Week” just about every week in China since 1990The correct response to the party boasting is not to deny China its success but to insist on proper attribution Japan South Korea and Taiwan were its forerunners in using repressed financial systems to enable investment and in relying on exports to become more competitive China has repeated all this albeit at a far greater and arguably more impressive scale At the same time its sustained rapid growth of the past four decades has less to do with the wisdom of the Politburo than with the work of a brilliant Saint Lucian economist Sir Arthur Lewis who in the 1950s explained that shifting labour from low-value farming to higher-value industry can if managed right engender just such a catch-up processAnd now for something completely differentThe coming decade is sure to prove more challenging With 65% of Chinese people already in cities and the population close to peaking Mr Lewis would point out that there is little scope for further gains from turning farmers into factory workers Parallels between China and the Asian dynamos of yesteryear are breaking down China is older and more indebted than they were at the same stage Whereas most countries seek to strengthen the rule of law as they mature Mr Xi is cultivating stronger party controlAdd to that a treacherous external environment Faced with the threat of economic decoupling from the West it is only rational for China to pursue greater self-reliance Thanks to its size and sophistication it may well triumph in key sectors from semiconductors to robotics But the sorry history of import substitution globally should make clear that this is a sub-optimal strategy involving much waste and eventually leading to lower growthAll this is almost enough to turn you into a China bear: to predict not an almighty crash but rather an ineluctable slide towards stagnation In conversations with analysts and investors versions of this narrative crop up again and again That it has become something like the consensus view is the single biggest reason why your columnist after a long run in China suspects that its economy will fare considerably better

 Jul 2nd 2021,A global corporate-tax deal takes shape,FOUR WEEKS ago the finance ministers of the G7 countries meeting in London trumpeted that they had sealed a “historic” and “global” deal to reform the taxation of multinational companies and thus to curb tax avoidance In fact that was just the precursor to an agreement struck on July 1st after fraught negotiations in the virtual realm involving 130 jurisdictions Though the talks were held under the auspices of the OECD an economic club of mainly rich countries the deal has been agreed to by rich and poor alikeOfficials signed up to a five-page statement with two main elements: a new minimum tax rate on multinationals’ profits; and a reallocation of the right to tax those of the largest away from places where they register their assets and towards where they make their sales In return for those new tax rights governments would refrain from some unilateral measures notably taxes on giant technology companies Securing agreement from so many countries on such a touchy issue is a remarkable feat Even so there is more work to do before the future of corporate taxation is settledFor years negotiators have been trying to close the gap between the places where multinationals do business and where they book profits As the global economy has digitised the gap has widenedfor example as firms have registered intangible assets in tax havens and reported profits there A study published by the IMF in 2018 found that a decrease of a percentage point in a country corporate-tax rate raised pre-tax profit reported there by 15% The effect has increased over time In the chase for these flighty profits tax rates have been slashedNow governments have had enough The proposed minimum tax of at least 15% would reduce companies’ incentives to game the system by reducing the gains from siphoning away profits to havens The reallocation of taxing rights should also reduce companies’ power to play with their tax base The location of customers is harder to manipulate than that of intangible assets like brands or algorithmsThe deal is structured to affect more companies as time goes by At first the reallocation of taxing rights will apply to those with global turnover above €20bn $24bn But if all goes well that threshold could fall to €10bn To address the common complaint that digital companies can make profits somewhere without registering the physical presence often necessary to tax them governments will be able to levy some tax if local revenues exceed just €1m In small poor countries with GDP of less than €40bn the threshold will be only €250000Agreement was not quite universal Of the 139 jurisdictions taking part in the online negotiations nine opted out including Ireland Hungary and Estonia as well as Barbados and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Their resistance is hardly surprising All these low-tax places stand to lose a competitive edge as well as tax revenue More remarkable is that havens such as Bermuda the Cayman Islands and Jersey signed upOther hold-outs include Nigeria and Kenya According to someone close to the talks one worry is that the reallocation of taxing rights will cost them revenue when the loss of unilateral measures is factored in Pascal Saint-Amans of the OECD is saddened by their decision “We have run the numbers and taking both pillars into account these countries would certainly benefit” he says On July 1st the African Tax Administration Forum a club of the continent taxmen issued a statement warning that “if the process is to produce an equitable outcome it will be important that developed countries do not exert political pressure on developing countries”Having secured a high-level agreement negotiators have agreed on a deadline of October to settle important details Some countries are pushing for a minimum tax rate of 15%; others want the floor to be higher The base of profits subject to the minimum tax the precise amount of taxing rights to be reallocated and the precise scope of unilateral measures to be withdrawn also have to be hammered outAfter that in 2022 governments must draw up an international treaty to reallocate taxing rights to be implemented in 2023 The deal also envisages that minimum taxes might be legislated for in 2022 and implemented in 2023 though countries could do that without waiting for a treaty The agreement is a big step forward But plenty of taxing work still lies ahead

 Jul 1st 2021,How to assess the costs and benefits of lockdowns,“TO ME I say the cost of a human life is priceless period” said Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York state As they tried to slow the spread of covid-19 in the spring of 2020 politicians took actions that were unprecedented in their scale and scope The dire warnings of the deaths to come if nothing was done and the sight of overflowing Italian hospitals were unfamiliar and terrifying Before the crisis the notion of halting people day-to-day activity seemed so economically and politically costly as to be implausible But once China and Italy imposed lockdowns they became unavoidable elsewhereListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMuch of the public debate over covid-19 has echoed Mr Cuomo refusal to think through the uncomfortable calculus between saving lives and the economy To oversimplify just a little the two sides of the lockdown debate hold diametrically opposed and equally unconvincing positions Both reject the idea of a trade-off between lives and livelihoods Those who support lockdowns say that they have had few malign economic effects because people were already so fearful that they avoided public spaces without needing to be told They therefore credit the policy with saving lives but do not blame it for wrecking the economy Those who hate lockdowns say the opposite: that they destroyed livelihoods but did little to prevent the virus spreadingThe reality lies between these two extremes Lockdowns both damage the economy and save lives and governments have had to strike a balance between the two Were trillions of dollars of lost economic output an acceptable price to pay to have slowed transmission of the disease? Or with around 10m people dead should the authorities have clamped down even harder? Now that politicians are considering whether and when to lift existing restrictions or whether to impose new ones the answers to these questions are still crucial for policy today Alongside vaccines lockdowns remain an important way of coping with new variants and local outbreaks In late June Sydney went into lockdown for two weeks; Indonesia South Africa and parts of Russia have followed suitCountries have used a range of measures to restrict social mixing over the past year from stopping people visiting bars and restaurants to ordering mask-wearing The extent to which these strictures have constrained life has varied widely across countries and over time see chart 1 A growing body of economic research now explores the trade-off between lives and livelihoods associated with such policies Economists have also compared their estimates of the costs of lockdowns with those of the benefits Whether the costs are worth incurring is a matter for debate not just among wonks but also for society at largePeople who see no trade-off at all might start by pointing to a study of the Spanish flu outbreak in America in 1918-20 by Sergio Correia Stephan Luck and Emil Verner which suggested that cities that enacted social distancing earlier may have ended up with better economic outcomes perhaps because business could resume once the pandemic was under control But other economists have criticised the paper methodology Cities with economies that were doing better before the pandemic they say happened to implement restrictions earlier So it is unsurprising that they also fared better afterwards The authors of the original paper note that pre-existing trends are “a concern” but that “our original conclusion that there is no obvious trade-off between ‘flattening the curve’ and economic activity is largely robust”Another plank of the no-trade-off argument is the present-day experience of a handful of places Countries such as Australia and New Zealand followed a strategy of eliminating the virus by locking down when recorded infections rose even to very low levels and imposing tough border controls “Covid-19 deaths per 1m population in OECD countries that opted for eliminationhave been about 25 times lower than in other OECD countries that favoured mitigation” while “GDP growth returned to pre-pandemic levels in early 2021 in the five countries that opted for elimination” argues a recent paper in the Lancet The lesson seems to be that elimination allows the economy to restart and people to move about without fearSomething for nothingBut correlations do not tell you much Such countries’ success so far may say more about good fortune than it does about enlightened policy What was available to islands such as Australia Iceland and New Zealand was not possible for most countries which have land borders and once the virus was spreading widely eradication was almost impossible Japan and South Korea have seen very low deaths from covid-19 and are also cited by the Lancet paper as having pursued elimination But whether they did so or not is questionable; neither country imposed harsh lockdowns Perhaps instead their experience with the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s helped them escape relatively unscathedWhen you look at more comparable casescountries that are close together say or different parts of the same countrythe notion that there is no trade-off between lives and livelihoods becomes less credible Research by Goldman Sachs a bank shows a remarkably consistent relationship between the severity of lockdowns and the hit to output: moving from France peak lockdown strict to Italy peak extremely strict is associated with a decline in GDP of about 3% Countries in the euro area with more excess deaths as measured by The Economist are seeing a smaller hit to output: in Finland which has had one of the smallest rises in excess deaths in the club GDP per person will fall by 1% in 2019-21 according to the IMF; but in Lithuania the worst-performing member in terms of excess deaths GDP per person will rise by more than 2%The experience across American states also hints at the existence of a trade-off South Dakota which imposed neither a lockdown nor mask-wearing has done poorly in terms of deaths but its economy on most measures is faring better today than it was before the pandemic Migration patterns also tell you something There have been plenty of stories in recent months about people moving to Florida a low-restriction state and few about people going to Vermont the state with the fewest deaths from covid-19 per person after Hawaii points out Tyler Cowen of George Mason University Americans at least do not always believe that efforts to control covid-19 make life more worth livingWhat if all these economic costs are the result not of government restrictions though but of personal choice? This too is argued by those who reject the idea of a trade-off If they are correct then the notion that simply lifting restrictions can boost the economy becomes a fantasy People will go out and about only when cases are low; if infections start rising then people will shut themselves away againA number of papers have bolstered this argument The most influential by Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson two economists analyses mobility along administrative boundaries in America at a time when one government imposed restrictions but the other did not It finds that people on either side of the border behaved similarly suggesting that it was almost entirely personal choice rather than government orders which explains their decision to limit social contact; people may have taken fright when they heard of local deaths from the virus Research by the IMF draws similar conclusionsThere are reasons to think these findings overstate the power of voluntary behaviour however Sweden which had long resisted imposing lockdowns eventually did so when cases rosean admission that they do make a difference More recent research from Laurence Boone of the OECD a rich-country think-tank and Colombe Ladreit of Bocconi University uses slightly different measures from the IMF and finds that government orders do rather a lot to explain behavioural changeMoreover the line between compulsion and voluntary actions is more blurred than most analysis assumes People choices are influenced both by social pressure and by economics Press conferences where public-health officials or prime ministers warn about the dangers of the virus do not count as “mandated” restrictions on movement; but by design they have a large effect on behaviour And in the pandemic certain voluntary decisions had to be enabled by the government Topped-up unemployment benefits and furlough schemes made it easier for people to choose not to go to work for instancePut all this together and it seems clear that governments’ actions did indeed get people to stay at home with costly consequences for the economy But were the benefits worth the costs? Economic research on this question tries to resolve three uncertainties: over estimates of the costs of lockdowns; over their benefits; and when weighing up the costs and benefits over how to put a price on lifedoing what Mr Cuomo refused to doThe cure v the diseaseStart with the costs The huge collateral damage of lockdowns is becoming clear Global unemployment has spiked Hundreds of millions of children have missed school often for months Families have been kept apart And much of the damage is still to come A recent paper by Francesco Bianchi Giada Bianchi and Dongho Song suggests that the rise in American unemployment in 2020 will lead to 800000 additional deaths over the next 15 years a not inconsiderable share of American deaths from covid-19 that have been plausibly averted by lockdowns A new paper published by America National Bureau of Economic Research NBER expects that in poor countries where the population is relatively young the economic contraction associated with lockdowns could potentially lead to 176 children lives being lost for every covid-19 fatality averted probably because wellbeing suffers as incomes declineResearch is more divided over the second uncertainty: the benefit of lockdowns or the extent to which they reduce the spread of and deaths from covid-19 The fact that time and again the imposition of a lockdown in a country was followed a few weeks later by declining cases and deaths might appear to settle the debate That said another recent NBER paper failed to find that countries or American states that were quick to implement shelter-in-place policies had fewer excess deaths than places which were slower to act A paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences a scientific journal by Christopher Berry of the University of Chicago and colleagues cannot find “effects of [shelter-in-place] policies on disease spread or deaths” but does find “small delayed effects on unemployment”Is the price right?Running through all this is the final uncertainty over putting a price on life That practice might seem cold-hearted but is necessary for lots of public policies How much should governments pay to make sure that bridges don’t collapse? How should families be compensated for the wrongful death of a relative? There are different ways to calculate the value of a statistical life VSL Some estimates are derived from the extra compensation that people accept in order to take certain risks say the amount of extra pay for those doing dangerous jobs; others from surveysCost-benefit analyses have become something of a cottage industry during the pandemic and their conclusions vary wildly One paper by a team at Yale University and Imperial College London finds that social distancing by preventing some deaths provides benefits to rich countries in the region of 20% of GDPa huge figure that plausibly exceeds even the gloomiest estimates of the collateral damage of lockdowns But research by David Miles also of Imperial College and colleagues finds that the costs of Britain lockdown between March and June 2020 were vastly greater than their estimates of the benefits in terms of lives savedAn important reason for the big differences in cost-benefit calculations is disagreement over the VSL Many rely on a blanket estimate that applies to all ages equally which American regulatory agencies deem is about $11m At the other extreme Mr Miles follows convention in Britain which says that the value of one quality-adjusted life-year QALY is equal to £30000 which seems close to a VSL of around £300000 or $417000 given how many years of life the typical person dying of covid-19 loses The lower the monetary value you place on lives the less good lockdowns do by saving themThe appropriate way to value a change in the risk of death or life expectancy is subject to debate Mr Miles number does however look low In Britain the government “end-of-life” guidance allows treatments that are expected to increase life expectancy by one QALY to cost up to £50000 points out Adrian Kent of Cambridge University in a recent paper and allows a threshold of up to £300000 per QALY for treating rare diseases But it may be equally problematic to use the American benchmark of $11m for covid-19 which disproportionately affects the elderly Because older people have fewer expected years left than the average person researchers may choose to use lower estimates of the VSLThe best attempt at weighing up these competing valuations is a recent paper by Lisa Robinson of Harvard University and colleagues which assesses what happens to the results of three influential cost-benefit studies of lockdowns when estimates of the VSL are altered see chart 2 Adjusting for age can sharply reduce the net benefits of lockdowns and can even lead to a result where “the policy no longer appears cost-beneficial” Given that these models do not take into account the harder-to-measure costs of lockdownshow to price the damage caused by someone not being able to attend a family Christmas say or a friend funeral?the question of whether they were worth it starts to look like more of a toss-upOnce you open the door to making adjustments things become more complicated still Research on risk perception finds that uncertainty and dread over an especially bad outcome especially one that involves more suffering before death mean that people may be willing to pay far more to avoid dying from it People appear to value not dying from cancer far more than not dying in a road accident for instance Many went to extraordinary lengths to avoid contracting covid-19 suggesting that they place enormous value on not dying from that disease Some evidence suggests that the VSL might need to be increased by a factor of two or more writes James Hammitt also of Harvard in a recent paper That adjustment could make lockdowns look very worthwhileThe malleability of cost-benefit analysis itself hints at the true answer of whether or not lockdowns were worth it The benefit of a saved life is not a given but emerges from changing social norms and perceptions What may have seemed worthwhile at the height of the pandemic may look different with the benefit of hindsight Judgments over whether or not lockdowns made sense will be shaped by how society and politics evolve over the coming yearswhether there is a backlash against the people who imposed lockdowns whether they are feted or whether the world moves on Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also listen to The Jab our podcast on the race between injections and infections and find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe and AmericaA version of this article was published online on June 29th 2021
 Jun 24th 2021,An anniversary for free traders,ABOUT HALF of most British people income in the 1830s and 1840s was spent on food Hunger was commonplace occasionally sparking riots Contributing to the high cost were tariffs on imported grain called the Corn Laws which soared as high as 80% The system enriched aristocratic landowners when most Britons were not allowed to serve in Parliament or voteListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFacing public anger a famine in Ireland and fears of starvation in Britain the prime minister Robert Peel introduced legislation to end the tariffs On June 25th 1846 the House of Lords repealed the Corn Laws following a House of Commons vote a month earlier It marked a major moment in the history of open economies How it was achieved offers lessons to those defending the global trading system todayThe first lesson is to organise a broad coalition and creatively use the media It was not simply the poor who had an interest in lower grain prices A new generation of prosperous manufacturers and moral-minded aristocrats joined forces They established what might be one of the first lobbying groups the Anti-Corn Law League which hosted rallies financed research and supported political candidates Books and pamphlets sprang up to make the case The Economist itself was founded in 1843 to campaign for the abolition of the Corn Laws and for free tradeThe second lesson is the need for small victories to generate momentum rather than going for big wins immediatelyPeel policy of “gradualism” His plan did not fully remove sliding-scale tariffs until 1849 giving time for landowners to adapt Meanwhile Britain free-trade moves helped usher in a wave of trade agreements across Europe and with AmericaThe third lesson is the need for tangible benefits for the public By 1850 people were paying around a quarter less for bread than if repeal had not occurred according to Kevin O’Rourke of NYU Abu Dhabi The real incomes of society top 10% fell while those of the bottom 90% grew slightly notes Douglas Irwin of Dartmouth CollegeMuch can be learned from Peel approach Today free trade is promoted by stale policy wonks and rapacious executives nothing like the broad energetic coalition of the past Opponents of globalisation use social media far more effectively than its supporters Politicians vie for grand gestures rather than quiet incrementalism And the benefits of free trade are largely hidden from consumers Those who take to the ramparts to protest against globalisation fail to notice why their smartphones are so cheapYet the most important lesson is about leadership Peel had opposed repealing the Corn Laws but faced with a crisis he was willing to split his party and lose his job to do the right thing The divided Conservatives rarely held power during the following 30 years It was “the whole community” that mattered Peel wrote in his memoirs and whether “cheapness and plenty are not [better] ensured for the future” by free trade than by protectionism What leader would be willing to do that today?

Or do you avoid wiping out equity to begin with?” says Nicholas Zhu of Moody a credit-rating agency Regulators are he says taking a mixed approach likely to support lower-yielding senior debt but not junior debt such as perpetual bondsThe weakest banks in China are almost entirely its smallest ones They generally have dodgier assets less-professional management and thinner capital cushions Rather than dealing with them one by one regulators are working to bind them together Mergers are under way in the provinces of Liaoning Shanxi and Sichuan “Consolidation is something we expect It allows for higher requirements for corporate governance and risk control” says Vivian Xue of Fitch another credit-rating agencyPerhaps the biggest concern about China banks today is not their recklessness but whether regulators are themselves creating new risks with a new set of lending rules Worried about the property sector they have told banks to cap their mortgages and other property lending to no more than 35% of their loan books Meanwhile regulators ordered banks last year to increase loans to smaller firms by between 30% and 40%“In the past regulators complained that banks all looked alike and wanted them to serve different client bases” says May Yan an analyst with UBS a bank “Some of the recent regulations are making banks look the same” Their income trends are already more similar Take for instance the ten biggest banks in China Virtually all posted profit growth of about 2% last year with the least differentiation among their results on recordThis trend suggests that the main risk for Chinese banks is a lack of diversification Along with having similar lending profiles their assets are overwhelmingly concentrated within China Overseas loans now account for just 2% of their lending portfolios All the loan-loss provisions capital buffers and improved governance may make them safer But ultimately the only measure that really matters is the health of the Chinese economy

around destroyed firms and subtly adjusted habits The economy has evolved in other words Strangely most economic models do not treat the economy as an evolving thing undergoing constant change They instead describe it in terms of its equilibrium: a stable state in which prices balance supply and demand or the path the economy follows back to stability when a shock disturbs its rest Though such strategies have sometimes proved useful economics is the poorer for its neglect of the economy evolutionary natureListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEvolutionary economics seeks to explain real-world phenomena as the outcome of a process of continuous change Its concepts often have analogues in the field of biological evolution but evolutionary economists do not attempt a rigid mapping of biological theories to economic ones An evolutionary approach acknowledges that the past informs the present: economic choices are made within and informed by historical cultural and institutional contexts Fittingly the habits of the economics profession today can be understood only by examining the field own history In the 19th century the discipline that would become economics was an evolutionary science in several senses Thinkers of diverse backgrounds vied to offer theories which best explained economic activity while at the same time its practitioners saw the object of their study as an extension of the biological sciencesIndeed social-science thinking informed the views of naturalists such as Charles Darwin The Reverend Thomas Malthus who explained how population growth must lead to a life-and-death competition for resources influenced Darwin as he sketched out how natural selection might lead to the emergence of new species And while Alfred Marshallamong the figures most responsible for setting economics on its modern mathematised courseanalysed economic behaviour using systems of equations which could be solved for an “equilibrium” he did so as a necessary expedient “Mechanical analogies” were useful he reckoned but “[t]he Mecca of the economist lies in economic biology”As the 20th century began an intellectual tug-of-war took place between more evolutionarily minded figures and their equilibrium-focused peers Thorstein Veblen complained that economists wished to treat the individual like a mindless particle He thought instead that people choices were informed by complex emotions and the history and traditions of the communities around them “An evolutionary economics must be the theory of a process of cultural growth” he ventured Joseph Schumpeter was perhaps the most famous exponent of an evolutionary worldview: an outlook shaped by his observations of entrepreneurial activity He described creative destruction as a “process of industrial mutationif I may use that biological termthat incessantly revolutionises the economic structure from within”In the post-war West the neoclassical approach built around equilibrium models won out Such models shared a mathematical rigour and elegance with high-prestige fields like physics and lent themselves more readily to making the forecasts governments required Milton Friedman argued that it did not matter if the models made unrealistic assumptions about the behaviour of people and institutions So long as the economy looked in aggregate “as if” individuals made rational decisions and models thus yielded accurate predictions that was good enoughBecause they very often did not do so an evolutionary approach crept back into the profession One important contribution came in 1982 when Richard Nelson now of Columbia University and Sidney Winter now of the University of Pennsylvania published “An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change” Neoclassical models of economic growth failed to capture the forceslike Schumpeterian creative destructionwhich played an essential role in generating technological change they thought Theories often supposed for instance that executives knew and would immediately adopt profit-maximising strategies In reality practices might differ widely across an industry reflecting distinct beliefs and the persistence of firms’ unique cultures and habits As these approaches competed some ways of doing things became more widespread across an economyuntil some other “industrial mutation” changed the competitive dynamic againMessrs Nelson and Winter inspired an entire literature on corporate structures and competition across industries Empirical work across other parts of economics seems increasingly to reflect an evolutionary influence Recent influential studies of innovation for example focus on things like exposure to inventors in childhood or the beliefs imparted by academic mentors as contributors to individuals’ creative output in addition to factors which have previously received more attention such as educational attainment and the financial incentive to innovateModification with dissentPerhaps most intriguing is recent work on culture role in shaping economic outcomes To accept that culture influences behaviour is to allow that people are not foresighted utility calculators but rather social creatures who rely on norms and traditions when taking decisions But culturewhich changes slowly and is often transmitted across generationscannot be understood outside an evolutionary framework Evolutionary economics having got a foot in the door may prove difficult to push back outThis is all to the good Theory built on unrealistic assumptions has proved less illuminating than economists a century ago might have hoped Trying to understand the world as it is could yield insights and perhaps eventually better predictions Economists still working with equilibrium models out of habit should consider the disruptive potential of a new yet old approach

 Jun 24th 2021,Global markets adapt to a change in the Federal Reserve tone,FOR SEVEN months most investors have been singing the same uplifting song Since Pfizer and BioNTech published the successful

denied peopleholidays dining out shoppingwas unleashed This “reflation” trade lifted the prices of commodities used in construction such as copper and lumber to record heights It lifted global stocks

Reservehitherto apparently sanguine about rising American inflationsuggested that it may eventually think about raising its policy rate long anchored at zero Shorter-dated bonds and shares tumbled as did those building-boom commodities These jitters were soothed somewhat on June 22nd when Jerome Powell the Fed chairman stressed the central bank would remain patient and enable the economy to make a full recovery from the pandemic But investors have been left wondering whether the great reflation trade is overThe enthusiasm of the past few months was underpinned partly by the assumption that the Fed would maintain the same super-loose monetary policy Hence the anxiety when Mr Powell suggested that the central bank might have to consider tightening “somewhat sooner than previously anticipated” The Fed raised its inflation forecasts and lifted its median estimate for the future of policy rates to include two increases in 2023 Mr Powell also said the Fed would begin discussing when to slow its asset purchases from the current $120bn per month This change in tone was reinforced two days later when James Bullard head of the St Louis Fed told CNBC that the first rate rise could arrive in late 2022The Fed had seemed nonchalant even as signs of overheating in the American economy became harder to ignore A measure of inflation the central bank watches closely “core PCE” jumped to 3% year on year at the end of April Headline inflation gauged by the consumer-price index climbed from less than 2% in February to 5% in May Anecdotal evidence of overheating abounds from the piping-hot housing market to spiking grocery bills gas prices and Uber fares Yet Fed officials said the acceleration in inflation was “transitory” and that they would look through its effects Investors believed themSo they were surprised by the change of tone Many of the trends that have dominated markets since November unwound Reflecting the prospective rate increases the yield on two-year Treasury bonds jumped to 027% from 016% on June 14th see chart The 30-year yield which tends to follow long-term growth or inflation expectations tumbled to 202% on June 18th from 221% before the Fed meetingThe prospect of the Fed putting a brake on inflation and growth hit share and commodity prices “Value” stocks which had performed particularly well since November were hit hard Copper lost its spark shedding 8% over the week Lumber was felled dropping 15% The S&P 500 slipped from near a record high ending the week about 2% lower though it has since recovered those losses partly thanks to Mr Powell soothing words on June 22ndThe Fed also wrong-footed monetary policymakers elsewhere When it last unwound a post-crisis stimulus in 2013 the Fed set off a notorious “taper tantrum” in which many emerging-market currencies fell sharply against the dollar On June 16th the Brazilian central bank raised its interest rates from 35% to 425% the third increase since February despite the damage covid-19 has done to Brazil economy and to Brazilians’ health In Hungary the central bank raised interest rates by 03 percentage points on June 22nd a little more than expected It was followed a day later by the Czech National Bank Central bankers in the developing world worry that a more hawkish Fed will cause their currencies to weaken exacerbating their inflation problemsThe question investors face now is how much the Fed stance has really shifted It now appears that the initial reaction to the Fed meeting was overdone When many investors hold the same portfolio of positions they can be forced to bail out in a hurry if markets move violently against them This liquidation of positions can exacerbate volatility In fact there are reasons to think the great reflation trade has further to run: the reopening of the American economy is still in its early stages the end of 2022 is a long way off and Mr Powell still seems apprehensive about tightening policy too quicklyBut those turning their backs on emerging-market currencies value stocks and copper will find plenty to convince themselves that the economy is about to slow once more Lumber prices were already slipping before the Fed meeting as a frenzy for home improvements cooled Credit-card spending an early indicator of economic activity had been running 20% higher than it was two years ago but this month the pace has slowed to 165% according to Bank of America Soon investors will learn which bet pays off next 
 Jun 24th 2021,A new phase in the financial cycle,GROWING UP IS hard to do but growing old is harder As the business cycle matures and ages it goes through phases just as people do These are mirrored in financial markets Strategists like to talk in terms of early- mid- or late-cycle investing It is tricky to say when one stage ends and another begins just as it is hard to delineate adulthood from adolescence The markets drop some hints though The slope of the Treasury yield curve is oneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn the first quarter the message from the yield curve seemed clear A steepening in its slopea rise in long-term yields relative to short-term yieldssaid the economy was accelerating and inflation was coming A lot of that steepening has since been reversed to the surprise of many Of the many interpretations of this change one stands out It says the early-cycle phase is over The markets have entered a new and more difficult stageStart with the shift in the yield curve A standard measure of its slope is the gap between two- and ten-year interest rates The wider the gap is the steeper the slope At the start of the year the gap was 082 percentage points Three months later it had widened to 158 percentage points almost all because of a rise in long-term yields see chart A marked shift in fiscal policy in America was a big influence By March a bumper $19trn spending bill had been signed into law An even bigger package to finance infrastructure was in the worksYet in early April the curve began to flatten The yields on two- three- and five-year Treasury bonds perked up as money markets began to price in the prospect that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in 2023 There were bigger moves at the long end of the curve By this week the ten-year yield had fallen to 15% more than 02 percentage points lower than at the end of March The 30-year yield fell by even moreWhatever lies behind this it cannot really be laid at the Fed door The decline in long-term yields started long before last week Fed meeting which sounded a more hawkish tone on inflation Some put it down to “technical factors”bond trades made for reasons of risk management to rebalance portfolios or follow price momentum Global influences surely played a role Ultra-low interest rates in Japan and Europe act as a check on yields in America They can only go up so far before the weight of buying by yield-starved foreigners pushes them downHowever there is a deeper message The bond market is hinting that the early-cycle phase in which risk assets are embraced almost without discrimination has come to a close The peak in economic growth may have passed Output and orders readings in the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index PMI a closely watched marker of activity probably peaked in May Other cyclical indicators have rolled over The prospect of further fiscal stimulus is also more uncertain America infrastructure bill is stuck; whatever now emerges from Congress will have a far smaller price tag than the $2trn-3trn figure widely touted just weeks agoMarkets are forward-looking They now have less to look forward to If peak GDP growth lies in the past the scope for further upward revisions to forecasts for stockmarket earnings is limited The S&P 500 index already trades at a high multiple of prospective earnings A lot of good news is already priced into risky assets If you are an active trader you now need something to go wrong to create a buying opportunity says Eric Lonergan of M&G a fund manager Lacking fresh influences to drive prices up risky assets are vulnerable to declinesThere are echoes here of early 2004 says Andrew Sheets of Morgan Stanley a bank When America unemployment rate peaked in 2003 it was a cue for economic recovery and a strong early-cycle rally in risky assets Stocks commodities and corporate bonds performed very well just as they have over the past year As 2003 turned into 2004 the economy kept going But markets slipped into something of a funkThe outlook is similar reckons Mr Sheets: a period of consolidation in the stockmarket; a slight widening in credit spreads; an episode of modest dollar strength Not everyone will agree It is hard to accept that the early-cycle phase might be over It is barely a year since the trough in global GDP But if you live as fast and burn as brightly as this business cycle then mid-life arrives early You then start to wonder how you got here and what on earth will now drive you on
 Jun 24th 2021,The international role of the euro,WHEN THE European Union launched the euro two decades ago economists wondered if the new currency might pull off a feat no other had managed in the post-war period: to challenge the mighty American dollar However reserve managers at the world central banks as well as businesses around the world largely stuck with the greenback Now Europe is having another go at establishing the bona fides of the euro beyond its borders A significant step was taken on June 15th when €20bn-worth $243bn of bonds was issued as part of the Next Generation EU NGEU scheme to boost European economies Those bonds could yet rival American Treasury bonds as a safe asset of choiceListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKCurrencies exist mainly to facilitate the transactions of people and businesses within the borders of the places that issue them But having an international presence helps in many ways For firms having imports and exports denominated in their local currency rather than say the dollar means less disruption when exchange rates inevitably see-saw Issuing a currency that foreigners want to hold can make it easier for governments to raise money from them at cheap rates That in turn drives down the cost of borrowing for firms and banksThe euro is widely available outside the 19 countries that formally use it About two dozen countries link their own currencies to it in some way albeit mainly former European colonies and close neighbours Between a third and half of all euro banknotes by value are held outside the euro area according to the European Central Bank ECB Nevertheless by the normal measures used to gauge international usage it is a distant runner-up to the dollarAround a fifth of all foreign-exchange reserves owned by central banks and a similar percentage of cross-border loans and bonds are denominated in eurosthe share for the dollar is about 60% The euro share of payments for transactions is much closer to that of the dollar see chart unsurprisingly given that the EU is the world biggest trader of goods and services Still commodities like oil and cotton are mostly priced in dollarsIn its first few years the single currency looked as if it might rival the post-war champion By 2007 the euro even became the most popular currency in which to issue foreign-currency-denominated debt for example by multinationals It was not to last The financial crisis that started that year prompted skittish investors to fall back on the dollar as their currency of choice The euro-zone miasma that ensued during which the very survival of the single currency came into question seemed to vindicate their decision Depending on the measure used the euro has since flatlined or lost importanceEurope now wants to have another crack if not at overtaking the dollar then at least at reducing the latter dominance Two changes in circumstances mean there is a chance the euro could gain groundThe first is America changing attitude to international economic policymakingat least under the presidency of Donald Trump His brand of jingoistic protectionism jarred with the obligations incumbent on the issuer of the world reserve currency Even under the more conciliatory Biden regime Europe frets that its interests will not always be aligned with America Relying on the dollar is perceived as an even greater potential vulnerability than beforeIn March euro-zone leaders said that boosting the currency international use would help them achieve “strategic autonomy” The EU has been particularly irked to discover that businesses in the region were in effect forced to abide by American sanctions that Europe opposed for example on Iran America has used the need of big banks to have access to dollars to police their behaviour far beyond its shores Those that have fallen foul of American edicts have incurred large finesCritics see this extra-territorial prerogative as an undue weaponisation of the dollar That has encouraged a change of mind among those who have traditionally been resistant to boosting the euro international role In times of crisis global reserve currencies tend to spike as investors seek a haven Such unpredictable capital flows worried German monetary policymakers in the age of the Deutschmark; their scepticism carried over to the ECB It has historically sought to “neither hinder nor foster” an international euro but is now seen as more amenable to the ideaThe second change came unexpectedly as a result of the pandemic Whereas the last global recession brought the euro to the precipice on this occasion the swift actions of the ECB and national governments to support their economies were well received Such battle-hardening has boosted the credibility of the euro in a crisisa key attribute of a global currencyBetter yet the bloc has responded to the crisis by tweaking the architecture of the single currency in ways that should bolster its international attractiveness A big step was the creation of the NGEU scheme and the subsequent bond issuance The bonds are backed in effect by the balance-sheet of all EU member states thus making them roughly similar to America Treasury bonds This is a relative novelty in Europe where borrowing has mostly been done by national governments whose creditworthiness varies The new pan-EU bond creates a way for investors to save in euros without taking credit risk as they might were they lending to Italy sayThe absence of such a “safe asset” had been one element hampering the use of the euro internationally All manner of cross-border operations from central-bank reserve management to companies borrowing money in a foreign currency are underpinned by a liquid risk-free benchmark The bonds of Germany have served as an imperfect proxy until now but the NGEU issuance “contributes to making the euro a better substitute for the dollar” says Reza Moghadam of Morgan Stanley a bankNot all barriers to more international usage of the euro have disappeared For one the “safe asset” may prove temporary: in theory the last NGEU bond will be issued in 2026 though many think the scheme will be extended in some way The sums of money are also small by global financial standards Total EU debt outstanding will peak at around $1trn while America has over $20trn of debt outstanding that investors can tradeAnd some of the single currency idiosyncrasies remain The euro area lacks some of the important elements of a coherent financial union for example risk-sharing if banks totter Lack of fiscal redistributionthe NGEU notwithstandingmeans a rerun of the euro-zone crisis is still possible Capital markets are still thin and balkanised unlike those of America The lack of a single financial hub after Brexit does not helpWhether gaining share from the dollar helps insulate Europe from America reach is questionable: banks will always need dollars and thus a foothold in New York even if the euro thrives A European plan to circumvent sanctions on Iran largely floundered Few think the single currency can displace the greenback but it could perhaps rebalance the international monetary system That may help reduce the disruptions caused by American central bankers for example when a slight tightening of monetary policy in 2013 caused a “taper tantrum” that reverberated globally The euro is the obvious currency to provide diversificationIn 2019 Mark Carney then governor of the Bank of England mused that technology might disrupt the kinds of network effects that anchor the dollar at the heart of international finance The rise of digital currencies issued by central banks which the ECB is considering might result in a new equilibrium where many currencies share global reserve-currency status That could provide space for China yuan which has its own global aspirations but is hampered now by its lack of convertibilitySuch an outcome still feels some years away But it would mark a return to the norm before the second world war in which several currencies including the dollar held joint dominance Europe has long bristled at the “exorbitant privilege” America enjoys thanks to the dollar special status It may find it less intolerable if it can seize a share of it A version of this article was published online on June 21st 2021

but it is hard to disentangle the effect of technological change from lockdowns It is true that America GDP is nearly at its pre-pandemic level even as the level of employment is 7m lower This some say shows that the economy can get by with many fewer people But it could just mean that productivity per worker has risen perhaps because of poorly understood things like remote working Many of those on the sidelines will get jobs as fear of the virus fades and they find something which suits them in turn raising output above pre-pandemic levelsIt is not only labour shortages which undermine the story of a growing wave of job-killing robots In America the wages of the worst-paid workers who are thought to be especially vulnerable to automation are rising more quickly than the average in contrast to the aftermath of the financial crisis Borrowing a methodology from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis The Economist has divided America labour market into “routine” and “non-routine” roles Routine jobs involve patterns which are easier for robots to learn: say data entry or checking out goods in a supermarket For four decades routine jobs have slowly declined as a share of the total as robots have improved see chartSticking with the routineSo far however the covid-induced downturn is bucking the trend Had the pre-pandemic rate continued we estimate that in May 2021 routine jobs would have accounted for 409% of overall employment In fact they now account for 414% meaning that America now has in the order of 1m “extra” routine jobs than expected Perhaps the uncertainty over variants is deferring some investment in robotics The mere act of installing new machinery is also more difficult in a world of travel bans and quarantine American imports of industrial robots fell by 3% in 2020Australia may be a better place to look for signs of a job-killing wave After some strict lockdowns the country has been under fairly loose domestic restrictions for over a year giving a glimpse of what may lie in store elsewhere Adapting the results of a government study in 2015 we gave 335 occupations from “hotel and motel managers” to “complementary health therapists” a score from zero to 100 reflecting how automatable they seemAutomatable jobs were in relative decline before the pandemic falling to 57% of the workforce by 2019 The trend has continued with evidence of a covid-19 acceleration: 55% of Australians are now employed in vulnerable occupations We found similar trends in New Zealand Yet Australia unemployment rate is nearly as low as before the pandemic Howls from employers about labour shortages are even louder than in America Automation is not it seems putting people on the economic scrapheapThe pessimists could eventually be proved right But even if they are not predictions of a world without work will continue This is because the enduring fear of the march of the machines is not really the result of a dispassionate analysis of the evidence It could hardly be so when centuries of technological improvement have never led to widespread structural unemployment Countries with more robots tend to have less joblessness not moreWorries about technological unemployment are instead the expression of something else They reflect a deep-seated fascination with and fear of technology And they reflect many economists’ concern to get policymakers to pay more attention to the job prospects of people with the least marketable skills who are always most vulnerable to economic shifts and shocks These are perfectly understandable motivations But next time you hear a warning about job-killing robots think twice Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also listen to  The Jab our podcast on the race between injections and infections and find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe and America
 Jun 17th 2021,America high-yield debt is on ever-shakier foundations,INVESTORS IN COMPANIES issuing high-yield or “junk” debt have had a relatively benign pandemic Usually such highly leveraged borrowers are stung by economic hardship During the global financial crisis over a decade ago around a seventh of such firms in America defaulted on their debt in one year Yet according to Moody a rating agency less than 9% of them went into default in the year to August 2020 and the rate has continued to drop since By the end of 2021 a booming recovery should put it back below its long-term average of 47%Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt may be too soon for high-yield investors to congratulate themselves though The low default rate masks a market that is much riskier than it was before covid-19 struck Take high-yield bonds the market for which is worth $17trn Issuers have record levels of debt relative to their earnings increasing their vulnerability to higher interest rates or a disappointing economic recovery Cash-strapped borrowers are taking advantage of less restrictive loan contracts to rough up their creditors And for the companies that do default loans that used to be associated with high levels of protection and security are turning out to offer lenders anything butStart with the sheer amount of debt Last year $435bn-worth of junk bonds were issued As a result the average high-yield borrower now has debt equivalent to an unprecedented six-and-a-half times their trailing 12 months’ gross operating profits or EBITDA see chart Oleg Melentyev of Bank of America cautions that the low default rate may have merely deferred the pain “Companies are carrying the baggage of capital structures that should have been restructured but weren’t” he says “We will pay the price of elevated defaults at a later point in the cycle”Meanwhile borrowers with liquidity problems have the upper hand over their lenders Evan Friedman and Enam Hoque of Moody describe how investors’ hunger for returns during more than a decade of low interest rates has loosened loan agreements Maintenance covenants or restrictive clauses that allow lenders to seize the reins if the borrower financial position deteriorates are now mostly absent Worse incurrence covenants which place limits on borrowers’ ability to issue new debt and pay dividends have lost force over time “When you go covenant-lite and make your incurrence covenants toothless you give all the flexibility to the borrower to run the show” says Mr FriedmanRunning it some of them are Serta Simmons Bedding a mattress manufacturer gained notoriety last year for raising $200m by swapping its debts to some lenders for new ones with a higher level of security Without their consent the non-participating creditors were exposed to higher losses in the event of a default A lawsuit seeking to unwind the transaction was dismissed by the courts paving the way for similar deals in the futureWhat happens to loans that do turn sour? Lenders are used to the idea that so-called “first-lien” debt grants them priority over the borrower assets should it go bankrupt But Moody analysis of defaults during the pandemic shows that first-lien lenders are losing nearly twice as much of their capital as they used to: the average recovery rate in 2020 was 55% compared with a long-term average of 77%This is the result of deteriorating debt structures another decade-long trend In the past first-lien loans had high recovery rates because a significant portion of the remaining debt was subordinatedie behind them in the queue in the event of a default But in 2020 over a third of first-lien loans had no junior debt sitting beneath them to absorb losses If all of a borrower debt has a first claim over its assets the value of that claim is lower and lenders lose more protectionNone of this necessarily means that America high-yield market is heading for catastrophe Interest rates remain low and a rapid recovery should restore earnings But a nasty surprise on either front could quickly spell trouble The covid-19 default cycle may yet have a sting in the tail 
 Jun 17th 2021,Will America housing boom lead to another financial crisis?,A  FAVOURED PASTIME for city dwellers on holiday to quainter towns and villages is to peruse the windows of local property firms and dream of swapping their cramped two-bedroom flat for an entire house and garden Your correspondent is not immune to the appeal: she gazed wistfully at a pretty house near the Deschutes river in Bend Oregon situated among the lakes and peaks of the Cascade mountains pictured She dutifully checked the listing price on Zillow a real-estate platform only to face grim reality: the three-bedroom house was worth $125m a 44% increase from a year earlier yielding a price per square foot higher than Queens and most of Washington DCListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is hard not to feel unease at the spectacle America housing market is making of itself House prices have risen 13% on the year the biggest jump since before the 2007-09 financial crisis Inventories of homes for sale have plummeted: there are so few on offer in America that there are currently more agents than there are listings The typical home sells in 17 days a record low for 17% more than its asking price a record high When Redfin another property platform conducted its annual survey of around 2000 homebuyers 63% reported having bid for a home they had not seen in person The last boom in house prices was followed by a deep and painful recession Is history likely to repeat itself?Consider the mixed news first The average loan to value of a new mortgage in America is a reasonable-sounding 83% On the reassuring side this figure has not crept higher even as prices have soared The worrying aspect is that borrowers are bifurcated If a homebuyer can put up 20% of the value of a property they do not have to buy private mortgage insurance As such around 40% of borrowers make a 20% or greater down-payment Most of the restmore than halfput down less than 10% Given how rapidly prices in some markets have soared a house-price slump could leave some of them underwaterAnd yet compared with the past borrowers are in much better financial shape Just a quarter of mortgages originated between 2004 and 2007 were for people with “very good” credit scores above 760 An eighth of borrowers were “subprime” with scores below 620 Standards are higher now In 2019 60% of mortgages were made to those with scores above 760 This share climbed further during the covid-19 pandemic as banks fearing losses tightened lending standards: 73% of mortgages made in the first quarter of 2021 went to borrowers with very good credit scores Just 14% went to subprime borrowersThere is anecdotal evidence of caution from mortgage bankers too They are reputedly calling up workplaces to ensure that employees relocating out of the big high-cost-of-living cities will be allowed to work remotely indefinitely One bank reports that its busiest lending businesses have been those catering to the well-heeled: mortgages for second homes and “jumbo” mortgages those bigger than $550000 If the roaring housing market of the mid-2000s was the product of reckless lending to unreliable borrowers the boom now is made of different stuff: large loans made to wealthy borrowers with long credit histories in search of greener pastures 
 Jun 17th 2021,Why China has learned to relax about its currency,IN A WORLD in which transparency has become a fetish it is refreshing to try to get a read on the People Bank of China PBOC Its various nods and winks give market analysts something to interpretor over-interpret On May 31st it announced that it would increase the proportion of foreign-currency deposits that commercial banks must keep on reserve at the central bank from 5% to 7% After some chin-scratching PBOC watchers came to a conclusion: China was sending a signal that the yuan had been rising a bit too quicklyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKChina used to intervene directlyby buying and selling dollarsto get the exchange rate it wanted As recently as 2016 it ran down its foreign-exchange reserves from $4trn to $3trn to support the yuan But for the past four years or so its reserves have been stable; there has been no large-scale intervention to either put a floor under the yuan or to check its rise The surprise is not that China has thrown a little sand in the gears of its currency market It is that it has become so tolerant of some fairly big swings in the yuan valueThe yuan began its recent ascent a year ago see chart as China factories reopened and demand for goods surged in the locked-down rich world Chinese exporters took a greater share of world manufacturing says Mansoor Mohi-uddin of Bank of Singapore which in turn increased the trade demand for yuan Some headwinds became tailwinds The yuan had traded at a discount to reflect fears of an escalation in the Sino-American trade wars Exporters worried about a further hit to their revenues were inclined to hoard dollarsin part as security against their dollar debts The prospect of Donald Trump electoral defeat changed the picture The chances of further tariffs on Chinese goods were much reduced Moreover monetary conditions favoured speculative flows out of dollars and into yuan In contrast to the Federal Reserve the PBOC did not slash interest rates when the pandemic struck The seven-day reverse-repo rate one of China benchmarks was trimmed by just 30 basis points to 22% while the Fed funds rate was cut to 01% The higher interest on offer in China money markets favoured its currencyThat is not all China has been opening its markets to overseas investors Non-residents can more easily buy and sell stocks and bonds on the mainland markets China government bonds and “A” shares have qualified for inclusion in global benchmarks such as the MSCI equity indices and the Bloomberg Barclays bond index which are tracked by huge pools of capital A steady flow of foreign purchases has pushed up the yuan China has not stood in the way Tellingly on May 31st the PBOC picked a tool that does not interfere much with portfolio inflowsStill there is a paradox China has relaxed its hold on the yuan at a time when the ruling Communist Party has sought to exert greater control on private-sector businesses and on Chinese life in general If China-watchers know anything it is that control is prized in Beijing Being in control does not mean that everything has to be nailed down though In the eternal trilemma between monetary autonomy openness to capital and currency stability something has to give China has chosen to forgo a stable currency That allows it greater traction over the domestic money supply and credit growth which its regulators are more fretful aboutChina global ambitions for the yuan also influence its policy choices It has the world second-largest bond market and third-largest stockmarket Yet foreigners still own fairly few of its assets Even central banks which have had access to China bond markets for a while keep only 2% of their reserves in yuan That is barely more than they hold in the Canadian dollar Four years ago there was a vigorous internal debate about the merits of freer capital flows says Eswar Prasad of Cornell University But for the past two years the consensus has shifted in favour of them If the yuan is to be a global currency it needs first to be set freeEven so no one is confusing the yuan with a free-floating currency There are waysincluding all that subtle central-bank semaphoringfor China to exert influence It is still far from transparent about where its tolerance bands begin and end Such ambiguity is wise: give the markets a number and they will test it Perhaps surprisingly China has not stood in the way of a much stronger yuan But its policymakers reserve the right to keep currency markets guessing
 Jun 17th 2021,Uneven vaccination rates are creating a new economic divide,IN THE 1970S the fortunes of the world economy in all its unfathomable complexity seemed to turn on one product: oil Exported by a narrow clique of countries this vital input was hostage to ferocious political forces Today the world economic prospects similarly depend on another all-important input vaccines which are also narrowly produced delicately politicaland unevenly distributed Widespread vaccination is helping America to boom pushing core inflation to its highest rate since 1992 But delays in buying making and deploying shots have left much of the world vulnerable to new virus outbreaks and economic setbacksListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn June 16th America Federal Reserve raised its forecast for growth inflation and interest rates noting the country vaccine progress The median Fed official now expects two rate hikes in 2023 The change of tone was enough to increase bond yields both in America and in economies on the other side of the vaccine divideThe global economy should grow briskly this year: by 56% according to the World Bank which also updated its forecasts this month But it is a “tale of two recoveries” says the bank Ayhan Kose Rich countries many of which have vaccinated people relatively quickly are enjoying in Dickensian terms a spring of hope and so on But where vaccination has lagged especially in poor countries some economies seem to be going direct the other wayThe divide between the jabs and jab-nots is visible even in a simple comparison of vaccination rates and growth forecasts see chart Among the big economies highlighted by the World Bank the ten with the highest vaccination rates are forecast to grow by 55% this year on average The ten with the lowest are set to grow by just 25% The divide also shows up in forecast revisions Thanks to America pace of inoculation as well as the scale of its stimulus its projected growth for 2021 was revised upwards from 35% to 68% since the World Bank last released its forecasts in January Emerging economies that have vaccinated faster than their peers have also enjoyed large upgradesOn the other side of the divide the picture is far more chequered In the world poorest 29 economies including 23 countries in sub-Saharan Africa only 03% of the population has received even one dose of vaccine This group growth prospects have deteriorated Their combined GDP is set to grow by 29% this year not 34% as forecast six months ago That would be their second-worst performance in the past two decades Their worst was last yearVaccination helps growth in at least two ways It allows countries to relax lockdowns or any other restrictions on social interaction that are still inhibiting the economy And in places like New Zealand that have already lifted such measures it reduces the risk of a future outbreak making growth more resilient Goldman Sachs a bank has calculated an “effective lockdown index” that combines a tally of policy measures with data on mobility drawn from mobile phones It shows that social hustle and bustle has returned to many countries with high vaccination rates As the pace of inoculation picks up others will join them Indeed the countries most likely to outperform over the next few months says Goldman Sachs are those that are simultaneously making rapid progress in achieving immunity yet still labouring under social restrictions They have yet to feel the benefit of relaxing restrictions but will soon do soIn this kind of country timely economic data are still depressed by social curbs that will ease given the pace of vaccination In other countries however such as Taiwan new outbreaks of covid-19 have yet to show up fully in mainstream economic indicators which remain strong The “nowcast” model of JPMorgan Chase which uses monthly data to predict where the economy is today shows Taiwan growing at an annual pace of about 9% in the second quarter But the bank thinks that Taiwan economy will in fact have shrunk over that period In the euro area by contrast JPMorgan expects vaccinations to have lifted growth this quarter to over 7% at an annual pace The bank nowcast model however is predicting growth of less than 3%Given the importance of the global vaccine gap it is worth asking how quickly it is closing Japan South Korea Brazil Turkey and Mexico will each get at least one shot into the arms of half their population by August reckons Goldman South Africa and India will not reach that benchmark until December In both of those countries however many people have already recovered from the virus giving them some level of natural immunity Michael Spencer of Deutsche Bank thinks that India for example could reach a 70% immunity level in less than nine months counting everyone who has had either a past infection or a first shot of a vaccineAn uneven recovery is better than none But the strength of some countries’ growth could create problems for other parts of the world America boom for example has pushed its own consumer prices up by 5% in May compared with a year earlier and could also add to price pressure elsewhere forcing central banks to respondBrazil for example has raised interest rates sharply this year On June 11th Russia central bank also tightened for the third time since March Its governor Elvira Nabiullina cited both vaccination rates and “extremely loose monetary and fiscal policies in major economies” as reasons behind the increase in Russian prices She worries that higher inflation in Russia and elsewhere may prove more persistent than “perceived at first glance”Even temporary inflation could unsettle financial markets making investors doubt the Fed commitment to easy money That could increase the risk premium emerging markets pay on their borrowing “We are not necessarily worried about inflation” says Mr Kose whose team forecasts a rise in global inflation from 25% last year to 39% in 2021 “But we are worried about how these inflationary pressures can complicate policymaking” in emerging markets especially those with large amounts of foreign-currency debtPolicymakers in these countries fear a repeat of the “taper tantrum” in 2013 when the Fed talk about reducing or “tapering” its asset purchases led to an abrupt rise in American bond yields and a painful sell-off in emerging-market assets At its meeting on June 15th-16th the Fed began discussing an eventual tapering but the timing of such a move remains uncertainGlobal inflation this year will remain a far cry from the double-digit rates experienced in the stagflationary 1970s But just as the oil crisis back then forced policymakers into awkward dilemmas obliging them to raise interest rates in the face of economic weakness this year vaccine shortage could create similar discomfort for them The price of uneven vaccination may be premature austerity and monetary tightening in some unprotected parts of the world Countries that

 Jun 16th 2021,The methods and menace of the new bank robbers,Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTALK TO BANKERS and some will tell you that when it comes to cyber-crime they are second only to the military in terms of the strength of their defences And yet trawl the dark web as Intel 471 an intelligence firm did on behalf of The Economist in May and it is obvious that attempts to breach those walls are commonplace One criminal was detected trying to recruit insiders within America three biggest banks JPMorgan Chase Bank of America and Wells Fargo offering a “seven-to-eight-figure” weekly payment to authorise fraudulent wire transfers Another was auctioning the details of 30m accounts at Bank Mellat in Iran a country of 83mSuch activity represents the handiwork of a new breed of bank robber Forget the hold-ups of yore Today smartest hackers are likely to be backed by rogue states such as North Korea and to a lesser extent Iran or tolerated by countries such as Russia and China They benefit from unprecedented resources and protection from law-enforcement agencies As well as attempting to empty accounts they also target data for insider tradingAs one of the first industries to offer online transactions banks have been fending off hackers since the dawn of the internet They spend more on cyber-security than any other sort of firm$2691 per employeeand manage to foil a lot of the attempted thefts Nonetheless since 2016 no industry has suffered more from attacks than banks see chartSpeaking to Congress in May Jane Fraser who runs Citigroup a Wall Street giant called hacks the biggest threat to America financial system Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase has said they could become “an act of war” The result is that banks are under constant pressure to prepare for the worst “It not a matter of ‘if’ it a matter of ‘when’” says the head of cyber-security at a central bank The bankers need to know the methods and motives of their enemies What have they learned and can they remain a step ahead?As in other industries attempts to rob banks online generally start with “phishing” or tricking an employee into downloading a benign-looking software known as a “Trojan” that once installed creates a backdoor for other viruses to infect the company systems The ruses can be elaborate In 2019 when hackers infiltrated Redbanc an interbank network connecting Chile ATM system they faked a lengthy hiring process complete with rounds of video interviews just to fool one victim into downloading and running a TrojanOnce the backdoor is installed the hackers have numerous modi operandi These have evolved over time In the early to mid-2010s a popular tactic was to alter banks’ databases to inflate balances on existing accounts in order to drain them with fraudulent online transfers Another was to steal the names and passwords of employees authorised to access SWIFT the interbank messaging system that banks use for international transfers in order to make fraudulent transfers to the robbers’ own bank accounts In the world biggest cyber-heist in 2016 thieves transferred funds from an account the Bangladeshi central bank held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to banks in the Philippines Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia They stole $81mRansomware attacks such as those common elsewhere in business are on the rise But banks are exposed in other ways too One example is “jackpotting” where malware manipulates ATMs into spitting out lots of cash accessible to fake cards even if no funds exist Thieves then hire packs of money mules typically from local mafias to stage multiple withdrawals at once Using such methods in 2018 criminals got away with $135m from India Cosmos Bank through 15000 cash-machine withdrawals in just two hoursAnother tactic is to turn websites that banks visit regularly into poisoned “watering holes” most infamously in 2017 when criminals successfully targeted 104 mostly financial firms in 31 countries including seven banks in Britain and 15 in America In this case the websites of central banks in Poland Mexico and others were booby-trapped so that banks would download malicious files and infect themselves with malware These could be used to spy on the banks steal their data and ultimately make fraudulent transfers though in most cases the intrusion appears to have been discovered before money was stolenSometimes it is data not money that the robbers are after The latest trick is to steal financial-market data from within banks in order to facilitate insider trading A survey by VMware a cyber-security firm of 126 financial firms worldwide found that 51% saw a rise in such attacks last year Portfolio managers in America and Britain that were recently breached saw suspicious activity whenever they were about to trade says Tom Kellermann the firm strategy bossThe multiplicity of methods is compounded by the malevolence of those involved Originally heists were mostly conducted by private thieves from former Soviet states They included Carbanak a notorious syndicate that stole over $1bn from 100 banks after 2013 its masterminds were arrested in 2018 But since America cut North Korea out of its financial system in 2017 the hermit state has doubled down on its relationship with criminal gangs as a way of “making profit and evading sanctions” says Michael D’Ambrosio a top investigator in America secret service Variously named Lazarus Bluenoroff or BeagleBoyz such state-sponsored entities have access to vastly more resources and personnel than mere criminals Their members often live under cover in Russia and China says Mark Arena of Intel 471 An indictment by America Department of Justice published in January accuses two individuals linked to a North Korean military intelligence agency of attempting to steal more than $13bn via cyber-enabled bank heists and ATM raids as well as extorting cryptocurrency companiesMoreover rogue states often form joint ventures with private gangs One of them a Russian-speaking outfit that operates an infamous Trojan-for-hire called Trickbot provides access to many infected computers Some cyber experts were shocked recently when they found that it had been used in conjunction with North Korean malware in recent attacksIt is not clear how much money drains out of the back door Numbers crunched by Advisen a consultancy suggest banks have lost about $12bn to cybercrime since 2000 around three-quarters of which have come from data breaches Studies suggest every hour of business interruption costs a bank $300000 on average; a typical data breach causes losses of $6mBut banks usually forbid staff from discussing such attacks and the reported numbers dramatically understate the problem Though many institutions are obliged to report serious hacks to regulators and sometimes customers rules change frequently and vary across jurisdictions meaning disclosure is haphazardMoreover initial losses can be dwarfed by second-order effects The average incident puts 27% of customers at high risk of closing down their accounts at a targeted firm and sinks companies’ share prices by 5-7% on average says John Meyer of Cornerstone Advisors a consultancy A Supreme Court case in Britain this summer could make class-action lawsuits by customers affected by cyber-breaches easier exposing banks to hundreds of millions of pounds in potential damagesNot everything is going the criminals’ way though Forensic firms are doing a good job of attributing attacks to specific hacking groups and intelligence agencies at linking web handles to real people Some gangs are neutralised or caught In September the American army launched a cyber offensive that weakened TrickBot the North Korea-backed Trojan In January Ukrainian police in an operation with European and American counterparts arrested the thieves running Emotet another botnet allegedly responsible for at least $25bn in theft since 2014Banks strive to build nimbler fortifications and hire friendly “white-hat” hackers to probe their own defences The biggest are spending more: in June Bank of America said it would invest $1bn annually to counter mounting threats A survey by Deloitte found that financial firms spent an average 048% of their revenue on cyber-security last year up from 034% in 2019 Applied to the industry total revenue in 2020 that would make for $23bn-worth in spending in America aloneBut things may get worse because firstly banks’ networks are becoming costlier to secure “We recognise that we’re never going to prevent everything” says the cyber chief of a top American bank “So we have to have layered defences that assume multiple defences will fail” The multiplication of internet-connected devices the digitalisation of banking and remote working are offering new points of entry for attackers Akamai a security firm that serves eight out of the world top ten banks witnessed 736m attacks against financial firms’ web-based applications last year a two-thirds increase from 2019 The expansion of fintech firms without consistent regulation is creating blind spots And banks’ migration to the cloud on paper deemed more secure could backfire if it ends up concentrating risk on just a few platforms says Jano Bermudes of Marsh an insurance brokerSecondly the criminals have more resourcesboth technological and financialat their disposal According to security experts they mainly focus on expelling intruders before they have time to loot Yet says one soon hackers are likely to use artificial intelligence to shorten an attack from start to finishthe “kill chain” in the jargon Cyber-gangs are also growing rich Maze one of them announced its “retirement” in November after pocketing over $100m in ransoms in a year Moreover up-and-coming criminals are attempting to surf on the top tier success Last autumn hackers posing as Lazarus and Fancy Bear an infamous Russian group threatened over 100 financial firms with distributed denial-of-service attacks in which “botmasters” mobilise vast networks of infected machines to flood their targets with internet traffic if they do not pay a ransomSuch hackers can count on thriving secondary markets to monetise their loot On ToRReZ an eBay lookalike that The Economist recently visited via an ultra-private browser credit-card details go for $25 a popor four for the price of three

 Jun 10th 2021,Slow jobs growth may not be a bad sign for America recovery,AMERICA’S LATEST jobs reports landed with resounding thuds Upbeat Wall Street forecasters had expected firms to add 1m new jobs in April Employers made them look foolish taking on just under 300000 new workers instead Punters lowered their expectations for May but still wound up disappointed when on June 4th the Bureau of Labour Statistics reported net employment growth of just 559000: a decent showing in normal times but unsatisfying when millions remain out of work Underwhelming job gains look increasingly mysterious given firms’ desperation to hire With roughly one job vacancy available for every person out of work you would think that America labour-market problems could be solved soon enough But a leisurely pace of jobs growth does not necessarily indicate that the economic recovery has gone wrong A deeper dive into the figures suggests that it could simply reflect the difficulties of matching millions of workers with jobs at a time of unprecedented economic fluxListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKOn the surface the American jobs market does appear to be behaving oddly The economy is unquestionably booming Real output rose at an annualised pace of 64% in the first quarter of 2021 and is projected to have grown at an annualised clip of nearly 10% in the second Firms are keen to hire The 93m job openings posted in April were easily the most on record Employerssome at leastare attempting to lure workers with generous pay Though overall wage growth remains subdued rates of pay for newly hired workers are soaring in the service-sector occupations that are suffering most from labour shortages In the first quarter of this year the real wage for new hires in such positions say in restaurants or hair salons stood about 8% above the level you might have expected them to earn before the pandemic according to a recent analysis by Julie Hotchkiss of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta And faster job gains are certainly within the realms of possibility: employment rose by nearly 5m in June 2020 and by nearly 11m over a four-month stretch in the middle of last yearLook closely though and the picture becomes both less mysterious and more complicated Last year rapid rebound reflected the unique nature of the pandemic recession Employers shed a staggering 22m jobs in March and April 2020 but about 80% of the unemployed at that time were temporarily laid off with a job to which they expected to be recalled once lockdowns eased During the Great Recession by contrast temporary lay-offs never accounted for more than 15% of all unemployment When firms began to reopen the temporarily unemployed could immediately resume work; their ranks have plunged by 16m since April last year or by about 90% contributing to a staggering decline in the jobless rate of about nine percentage points But there are ever fewer temporarily laid-off workers waiting to be brought back see chart left panel Meanwhile workers who have permanently lost their jobs who made up just 9% of the unemployed early in the pandemic now represent about a third of all those out of workThis shift in the composition of unemployment probably means that joblessness cannot fall as quickly as it did last year The rise in unemployment in a recession is often much more rapid than the speed with which it goes on to fall during the recovery This asymmetry stems in part from the fact that the creation of a new job as opposed to the resumption of an old one involves time-consuming matchmaking as worker and firm try to find each other Congestion among the unemployed can slow this process Recent work by Niklas Engbom of New York University documents that an unemployed person applies for more than ten times as many jobs each month as an employed worker but is nonetheless less than half as likely per application to start a new job So though there may be a vacancy open for each jobless worker today employers bombarded with applications must take time to find a candidate they like delaying the moment at which the opening is filled or lengthening the time taken to fill the job if the chosen applicant in the meantime accepts another offerChurn churn churnIn addition note Robert Hall of Stanford University and Marianna Kudlyak of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco the road from unemployment to a permanent job match may include more than one round of searching Workers seeking employment often cycle through short-term jobs before finding a long-term match which helps explain why the pace at which individual unemployed jobseekers find work is faster than that at which aggregate unemployment returns to normalThough tepid headline jobs figures seem a cause for worry there is plenty of healthy churn taking place behind the scenes as another survey indicates Over the first five months of 2021 an average of 24m workers have moved from unemployment to employment each month Joblessness has not fallen by more over this period only because some workers have moved in the other direction while others are newly classified as unemployed after rejoining the labour force Though net employment growth might not show it hiring is robust In April employers took on more than 6m workersthe most on record barring the period of reopening last summer In the same month 58m workers left jobs including 4m who chose to depart voluntarily see chart right panel The increasing number of people quitting their jobs suggests that workers are using a moment of high labour demand and generous wage offers to find better opportunities This adds to the strain on human-resources departments in the short run further preventing jobless Americans from rushing back to work But it is also a sign of confidence in the economic recoveryA prolonged period of elevated involuntary unemployment undoubtedly carries risks But sub-million monthly payroll reports are not for the moment cause for much worry America remains on track to eliminate remaining pandemic unemployment within two years And in the meantime the churning of workers into new different jobs could leave the economy more productive than before and better equipped for a post-pandemic world 
 Jun 10th 2021,Will empty shopfronts revive as New York comes back to life?,SIT BY BAR Pisellino a chic watering hole in the West Village a swanky neighbourhood in Manhattan and the world seems to have righted itself Patrons munch on fat green olives and sip fizzy aperitifs as they watch well-heeled shoppers newly returned to the streets go byListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKJust across the street however an empty shopfront crumbles from neglect Despite ample government support during the pandemic many business owners cut their losses terminated their leases and closed down pushing retail vacancies in New York to new highs Fully 13% of shopfronts in the West Village are vacant compared with 19% in 2007 and 82% in 2017 according to data compiled by Scott Stringer the city comptroller and now a candidate for mayor The story is the same across most of Manhattan Though activity is now resuming it may be some time before the shopfronts return to lifeRetail rents have fallen sharply: in some neighbourhoods like SoHo they have dropped by more than 20% since 2019 That should make spaces more affordableand attractiveto prospective tenants But there is still a mismatch between what landlords and tenants want Though it is costly for residential tenants to move they rarely have to incur the expense of building a kitchen or a bathroom when they arrive Retail tenants and their landlords by contrast can spend a fortune turning a space into a restaurant or a boutique To make this worthwhile leases often span a decade or longer In a downturn landlords want to sign shorter leases in the hope that rents will soon recover Tenants however are unwilling fearing that landlords may jack up the rent once they have gone to the trouble of fitting out the spaceAn added complication comes from structural shifts in shoppers’ habits Many observers including Mr Stringer reckon that the rise of online shopping explains why vacancy rates were rising even before the pandemic The continued trend may lead landlords to accept that rents could stay low for a while But faced with the uncertainty of whether a retailer will survive or not they may prefer to wait for the right sort of tenant “If you find the market-clearing rent for a shop do the tenant improvements with them sign a ten-year lease and then 24 months later they go bankrupt are you really any better off?” says Don Mullen the founder of Pretium a property- and mortgage-investment firm Many commercial landlords want “Amazon-proof” tenants like nail salons and salad bars rather than retailersEven if landlords are willing to sign a lease with a lower rent those with a commercial mortgage can find their hands tied “Lenders often include covenants in their loan agreements” says Dan Rosenbloom of Cadre another investment firm These might stipulate that the rent must at least cover the interest owed If landlords want to sign a lease with a lower rent the lender might let them sign it says Mr Rosenbloom but they might require the borrower to stump up the cash to reduce the loan balance That can make rents sticky even if there is lots of vacant spaceThe queues snaking around the corner of Magnolia Bakery and the throngs browsing in the pricey shops along Bleecker Street suggest that there is no shortage of demand for cute bakeries and boutiques in the West Village But that does not mean the empty properties next door will be snapped up soon 
 Jun 10th 2021,Why the market for secondhand private-equity stakes is thriving,AT MIDNIGHT ON August 31st 1602 the public offering of shares in a new kind of enterprise closed The charter for the venture the Dutch East India Company granted it a monopoly on trade with Asia until 1623 at which time it was assumed the firm would be liquidated Twenty-one years is a long wait for capital to be returned Smaller maritime ventures were generally wound up and the spoils divided after three or four years when and if the ships returned So shareholders were given an option to cash out after ten years It hardly mattered A faster exit route soon opened upListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe merchants who gathered daily around Amsterdam New Bridge to trade spices and grain proved as willing to buy and sell shares These developments are recounted in “The World First Stock Exchange” by Lodewijk Petram a historian One of the book many lessons is that wherever there is a primary market for a new kind of asset there will soon be a secondary marketThere is a modern-day analogue in the treatment of stakes in private-equity funds The limited partners in such venturesthe pension schemes and sovereign-wealth funds that provide capitalare in principle committed for the life of the fund which is usually ten years or longer The reality is different A thriving market in “secondaries” negotiated sales of limited-partner stakes has emerged as private equity has matured Today private-equity investors are no more locked-in to their commitments than were the Amsterdam burghers of four centuries agoSecondary markets are first prompted by asset-holders who really need the cash The earliest sales in Amsterdam stockmarket were usually by merchants who could not pay the promised subscription In private equity the early secondary transactions were typically distressed sales They were often struck at biggish discounts25% or moreto the appraised value of the assets in the fundOver time the stigma to selling out has disappeared: in 2019 around $85bn worth of stakes changed hands These days the reason for the sale of a stake is often strategic It might be to rebalance portfolios by geography industry or vintage for reasons of risk management say or to reduce the number of relationships with the general partners of private-equity firms A lot of limited partners simply wish to manage their private assets as actively as their listed ones Often funds will sell for more than the appraised value of the companies in the portfolioOver the past decade there has been a trend towards secondary transactions led by general partners says Andrew Sealey of Campbell Lutyens an advisory firm It might be that a ten-year fund is about to expire whose general partners do not want to sell the portfolio of companies because the time is not propitious for a good exit price Some of the limited partners will need their money back thoughThe solution is a continuation fund An example was Nordic Capital VII a fund set up in 2008 which transferred its nine portfolio companies into a €25bn $3bn continuation fund in 2018 A price was set by auction Investors had a choice of selling their stakes at a premium to appraised value or staying in for five more years Most opted to stay inThe burgeoning trade in secondaries has been underpinned by the rapid growth of specialist funds Twenty years ago there were just a handful; now there are dozens Five of the ten largest private pools of capital raised last year were for specialist secondary fundsThe secondary market attracts big fund managers who want to offer their clients the full range of assets including private ones For a start it looks a lot less crowded than the primary business “Anyone can set up a buyout fund” says one fund manager Funds often compete to buy the same companies In a secondary fund by contrast there is a better chance of profiting from expertise It requires knowledgeable analysts and good information-gathering to appraise a stake in a portfolio of companies when it comes up for sale The general partners have the right of approval over buyers of secondhand stakes These are high barriers for would-be rivals to clearParadoxically the flourishing of the shorter-term secondary market has allowed the formal time horizon of private-equity funds to extend almost to infinity In this as in other ways private equity is following 17th-century Amsterdam At its outset the Dutch East India Company was supposed to have a limited lifespan It was still going almost two centuries later

in 2004 Goldman was allowed to establish the first foreign securities joint venture But when you look back over the past two decades the developments seem underwhelming and the returns meagreThat was largely because China opened up only when home-grown firms were big enough to withstand competition Some foreign retail banks launched gung-ho expansion plans only to quit the market later defeated by domestic giants’ extensive branch networks Securities joint ventures have taken more than a decade to pass majority control to foreign investors Payments firms such as Visa and Mastercard were shut out until mobile payments became dominant and competition futileWealth management could be different For one the foreigners do not face a mature market with insurmountable competition Regulators’ sweeping reforms mean that they are in fact entering what could become the world largest market for retail wealth at an early stageThis is evident in the financial products on offer today China mutual-fund industry has grown at a fantastic pace in recent years Many firms now oversee 1trn yuan in assets Money-market funds are ubiquitous But product design is still in its infancy Global firms are expected to bring a new level of sophistication Tuan Lam of Goldman says his group will offer quantitative products such as algorithmic and factor-based strategies and cross-border and alternative-asset investments “These are not present in China right now” he notesAnother benefit of the joint ventures is their links to China largest financial firms The banks and their tens of thousands of branches were key intermediaries during the first era of wealth management and say experts may also define the next Their wealth-management subsidiaries have vast portfolios and huge numbers of clients Take CCB It has more than 14700 branches;

and the “ether clones” aim to perform new functionsConsider the bitcoin clones first One problem with bitcoin is its volatility: in the space of a few hours on May 19th for instance prices fell by 30% To avoid such swings so-called “stablecoins” track government-issued or “fiat” in the crypto-lingo currencies insteadOther clones try to fix bitcoin privacy problems Since all bitcoin transactions are recorded on its blockchain which is public they leave a trail On June 7th American officials said they had recovered $23m-worth of a ransom paid in bitcoin to the hackers who shut down the Colonial Pipeline in May after identifying the virtual wallet they had used Some coins try to provide greater anonymity by using masking tech Monero for instance tries to make it hard to link flows to a fixed identity trace funds or observe transaction sizeStill other clones try to make payments cheaper and quicker to process To ensure that transactions are legitimate without relying on a central authority bitcoin relies on a system called “proof of work” where “miners” compete to validate blocks of transactions by solving time-consuming numerical problems Yet bitcoin design is such that it can handle only around seven transactions per second The creator of Litecoin therefore tweaked the algorithm so that new blocks are processed more often Dogecoin a coin that was developed as a joke and which often features in Mr Musk tweets has no cap on its supplyMore radical alternatives such as Cardano and Tron have switched to “proof of stake” under which validators are rewarded in proportion to the number of coins they lock into an escrow wallet while transactions are verified The process involves less hardware and fewer energy costsBut for every flaw that the clones try to fix a desirable attribute of bitcoin seems to be lost Stablecoins for instance require users to trust both the issuer which must hold hard cash in reserve and a government defeating crypto original anarchic aims Some may not be trustworthy In February the issuer of Tether the biggest was fined $185m by authorities in New York for lying about its dollar stashBig exchanges have delisted the ultra-private Monero fearing its potential for money-laundering Dogecoin is even more volatile than bitcoin The proof-of-stake system meanwhile encourages hoarding limiting liquidity It also favours concentration which goes against decentralisation says Eswar Prasad of Cornell University These trade-offs may be why none of the clones has come close to overtaking bitcoin see table According to analysts at Brave New Coin a research firm alternative measures such as activity on GitHub a platform used by programmers to collaborate on projects show that bitcoin remains uniquely popularThe threat comes instead from currencies with nimbler blockchains that can do more than record payments Ethereum which hosts ether the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency can execute automated programmes that for example move money between wallets only after a specific event Ether and its clones have become central to the budding field of decentralised finance DeFi where “smart contracts” replicate sophisticated financial transactions such as making loans or offering insurance without a trusted intermediary That is boosting adoption Over the past 12 months DeFi drove 40% of ether transactions up from 7% in the previous period reckons Chainalysis a data firmWith around $59bn in capital deposited in its applications DeFi remains small But it is growing fast and bitcoin with a blockchain that cannot accommodate smart contracts is ill-equipped to ride the wave Its first-mover advantage and scarcity make bitcoin likely to remain attractive as a speculative asset Yet that could prove poor consolation A version of this article was published online on June 9th 2021

 Jun 5th 2021,Will poorer countries benefit from international tax reform?,INTERNATIONAL TAX reform pits tax-hungry governments against giant multinational companies and their armies of tax advisers It sets high-tax jurisdictions against low-tax havens And it requires rich- and poor-country governments to somehow reach agreement The 139 countries haggling at a forum run by the OECD a club of mostly rich countries have yet to reach a consensus Poorer countries worry that the proposals on the table discussed are too complicated inflexible and unfairListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKDeveloping countries are thirsty for revenue in general and reliant on corporate tax in particular In 2017 African countries raised 19% of their overall revenue from corporation tax compared with an average of just 9% for OECD members That is partly because large informal sectors mean that they raise less in say personal-income taxThe current system for global tax dings poor countries in two ways For a start multinational companies shift their reported profits to low-tax havens depriving them of revenue Then the rules allocate taxing rights to countries that are home to company headquarters which tend to be rich Poor countries’ tax revenues are depressed by as much as 5% relative to an alternative system in which profits are taxed based on the current location of companies’ revenues their employees and their wage bills according to an estimate by Petr Jansky of Charles University and Javier Garcia-Bernardo of the Tax Justice Network an advocacy group By contrast those in rich countries are only 1% lowerThe reforms being discussed and supported by America Biden administration would reallocate the right to tax a slice of some companies’ profits and agree on a global minimum corporate-tax rate perhaps of 15% Poor countries want to crack down on tax avoidance as much as rich ones But a lack of cash and personnel makes it harder for them to engage in negotiations Though low-income countries represent 22% of negotiating members they make up only 5% of those attending important working-party meetings Those constraints apply to the ability to administer tax and police evasion too On May 12th the African Tax Administration Forum ATAF a group of national agencies criticised the idea of reallocating the right to tax the portion of multinationals’ profits above some “routine” level as “far too complex” suggesting that a share of total profits be reallocated insteadAnother worry is that the new deal will become a straitjacket The Biden administration has proposed a “binding non-optional” dispute-resolution process as a way of reassuring anxious companies that they will not be taxed several times over But some poor countries fear being on the wrong end of rulings too often and see broadly applied binding arbitration as a “red line” A process applying to a narrower set of disputes could fly however Another concern is that a minimum tax could threaten poorer countries’ use of tax incentives to reel in investment But a minimum rate of 15% is still well below most poor countries’ statutory tax rate leaving room for enticement A global floor might encourage some countries to go the other way by emboldening them to raise taxes on profits that are reported at homePerhaps the biggest complaint is that rich countries may get the bulk of taxable profits being grabbed back from havens while poor ones are left with the scraps In October the OECD estimated that a reallocation of taxing rights on some companies might help raise corporate-tax revenues in poor countries by around 1% a newer proposal from the Biden administration should yield a similar sum One negotiator for an African country called that a “disaster for developing countries” ATAF suggested that more companies be included by drastically lowering the revenue threshold from €20bn $24bn to €250m It is hard to imagine rich countries agreeing to that The complex knock-on effects of a proposed minimum tax of 15% could raise poor countries’ corporate-tax take by another 2-4% Even so rich countries will probably make bigger gains still

One lingering concern for some PE investors is that government funds might dispense with the middlemen and do more of their own direct investing Several large government funds have been recruiting from private-sector banks and law firms bolstering their ability to cut deals notes a lawyer who works with them “They are starting to compete with us directly” says the venture-capital investor Private investors will appreciate state cash much less when they are vying to outbid it 
 Jun 3rd 2021,What are the limits to government borrowing?,THE SCALE of Joe Biden plans is hard to exaggerate Where the American president former boss Barack Obama pivoted quickly to deficit-cutting after the trials of the global financial crisis Mr Biden first budget which he unveiled on May 28th will borrow unapologetically The plans assume that annual fiscal deficits will exceed 4% of GDP through to the end of the decade; net public debt will rise to 117% of GDP in 2030 from 110% today The largesse raises two big questions One is whether coming on top of past stimulus packages it will contribute to an overheating of America economy in the short term The other important question is whether in the longer term America can prudently afford to loosen the purse-strings for a sustained period As crisis has hit and interest rates have fallen politicians have felt more able to run up debts than in the past But the issue of whether and when limits to borrowing might apply still remains Recent research casts light on these constraintsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn a new working paper Atif Mian of Princeton University Ludwig Straub of Harvard University and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago attempt to gauge governments’ room to run Their analysis which does not incorporate the effects of the pandemic builds on recent work that estimates how the “convenience yield” on government bondsor the amount by which a bond yield is reduced because of the safety and liquidity benefits it offers investorsvaries with the size of the debt burden Other things equal the greater the volume of outstanding bonds the higher the return investors demand Work by Arvind Krishnamurthy of Stanford and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen of the University of California Berkeley suggests for example that a 10% increase in the ratio of debt to GDP pushes government-bond yields up by 013-017 percentage points In practice of course other things are not always equal: the long-run effect of increased bond supply on safety and liquidity premia may be offset by other factors such as a short-run surge in demand for safe assets prompted by financial instability leading to falling bond yields amid rising debt loadsBecause the supply of bonds matters Mr Mian and co-authors write a level of government debt that is too low can result in an interest rate that slinks towards zero But rates cannot fall much further below zero; the result is narrower scope for central banks to stimulate activity and therefore lower economic growth and higher unemployment The problems of debt sustainability are often associated with high debt levels which push the interest rate above the economic-growth rate When that condition is met the debt burden grows steadily even in the absence of new borrowing But the authors raise the theoretical possibility of another source of fiscal-sustainability problems: when too low a level of debt leads to serious deflation dragging the growth rate into negative territory and below the interest rateIn between those two extremes the researchers argue lies a “Goldilocks zone” in which a fiscal free lunch is possible They flesh out a point highlighted in 2019 by Olivier Blanchard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics: that when the interest rate on public debt is below the economy growth rate existing debt burdens have essentially no fiscal cost In such cases existing debt will decline as a share of output even if no new taxes are leviedthough a government that continues to run deficits may nonetheless add to its debt pile Assuming a balanced budget and based on estimates of the convenience yield on Treasuries the authors reckon that America Goldilocks zonethe maximum level of debt you could reach and then stabilise without raising taxescould extend up to about 260% of GDP The uncertainty around their estimates means the limit could lie between 230% and 300% of GDPThere is also a range of indebtedness across which governments may run deficits in perpetuity without increasing the debt burden America they estimate could run a deficit of 21% of GDP for ever so long as its debt is below 130% of GDP after which threshold the largest deficit that could be run in sustained fashion without raising the debt burden drops steadily towards zeroThis logic suggests that though supersized deficits may be appropriate now America cannot run them for ever Doing so would cause debt to rise potentially out of the Goldilocks zone and into riskier territory And the longer America waits to shrink its deficit to the maximum sustainable level the closer to surplus or the further into surplus that level will be Mr Biden may take some comfort from the fact that his borrowing is manageable for now Even so it could eventually limit America fiscal freedomBonds awayImportantly a Goldilocks window is not fixed Slower economic growth could shrink the safe zone by narrowing the gap between growth and interest ratesunless that is an economic slowdown also causes a sharp drop in interest rates pushing them closer to zero and necessitating fiscal stimulus Rising inequality may lead to calls for redistribution but because the rich tend to buy government bonds in disproportionate numbers levelling the income distribution may reduce the scope for a fiscal free lunch That also means the authors note that efforts to address wide deficits through progressive taxes may not bear much fruit: taxes on high earners will hoover up money that might be used to buy bondsAnalyses such as these are trying to understand circumstances outside of historical experience and necessarily come with large uncertainties and assumptions attached Budget-setting politicians too have uncertainties to navigate and must do so carefully Government borrowing plays a starring role in today macroeconomic zeitgeist A balance of sorts is still required between making good use of the government capacity to borrow and acknowledging that limits to public borrowing are not so distant that they can be ignored altogether

 Jun 3rd 2021,Twilight of the tax haven,Editor's note June 5th: This article has been updated after G7 countries backed a minimum global tax rate for big companiesAS IS OFTEN the case in multilateral matters America held the key When Janet Yellen its treasury secretary announced earlier this year that it was time to end the “race to the bottom” on corporate tax her remarks supercharged sputtering talks over a global deal to overhaul how much tax multinational companies pay and whereListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTalks are focused on two main changes: reallocating taxing rights towards countries where economic activity takes place rather than where firms choose to book profits; and setting a minimum global tax rate Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries gave the re-energised negotiating process a big fillip at their meeting on June 4th-5th backing a minimum rate of “at least 15%” and a redistribution of taxing rights that guarantees “market” countriesie those where companies sell stuffa bigger portion of taxing rights: on “at least 20% of profit exceeding a 10% margin for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises” They also signalled a desire to defuse a transatlantic row over the taxation of mostly American digital giants vowing to “provide for appropriate co-ordination” between the application of new international tax rules and the removal of punitive digital-services taxes which European countries and others have slapped on the sales of big tech firmsThis gives the broader G20 the main forum for international tax talks which also includes the likes of China and Russia plenty to chew over It is hoping to agree on terms as soon as July spurring the other 120 or so countries and territories involved in the talks to fall into line Germany finance minister has predicted a “revolution” in global tax rules “in just a few weeks”All revolutions have winners and losers In this case the clearest victors would be large economies where multinationals make lots of sales but book relatively little taxable profit thanks to tax-planning that siphons income to low-tax jurisdictions This mismatch has grown along with the rise of digital giants like Apple and Google the assets of which are largely intangible Poor countries where global companies have factories and other operations stand to benefit too though not by as much as they think they should The most obvious losers will be the havens that starting more than half a century ago took increasing advantage as globalisation made capital more footlooseoffering what they saw as much-needed tax competition and what many others saw as beggar-thy-neighbour economicsA study in 2018 concluded that around 40% of multinationals’ overseas profits are artificially shifted to low-tax countries One official closely involved in the current talks thinks the deal taking shape could “all but kill the havens” However havens come in various shapes and sizes from taxless Caribbean paradises to merely tax-light hubs in Europe and Asia Some have more to fear than othersParadise lostThings look bleak for the palm-fringed zero-tax territories such as Bermuda the British Virgin Islands BVI and the Cayman Islands Though they make nothing in corporate-tax revenue they have to differing degrees come to rely on fees from subsidiaries of large companies and a cottage industry of accountants lawyers and other corporate-service providers that sprouted up locally to serve them Their revenue is mere crumbs compared to the taxes saved by those firms but a lot for such small economies Corporate and financial services accounted for over 60% of the BVI government revenue in 2018The type of deal that the Biden administration is pushing and the G7 has backedwhich would apply the global minimum rate on a country-by-country basis rather than in aggregatewould blow up these havens’ business model They are livid but there is nothing they can do A diplomat says they are in the process of being “neutralised” and are “irrelevant” to the talks “No one wants to hear from them” Some at least have other revenue streams: Cayman is a big domicile for hedge funds Bermuda for insurersBetter-connected economies that have traditionally been friendly to corporate-tax-planners are less easy to dismiss Several European Union countries such as Ireland and Cyprus have lured investment with a low corporate-income-tax rate both levy 125% or as Luxembourg and the Netherlands have done with rules that make them attractive conduits in tax structures helping companies avoid tax in other countries An IMF study in 2019 found that such “phantom” investment had pushed Luxembourg stock of foreign-direct investment to $4trn an improbable one-tenth of the global total Hong Kong and Singapore have also benefited as corporate-tax entrepotsSome of the more egregious loopholes fuelling these flows have been closed in recent years following an OECD-brokered deal in 2015 Among them is the Double Irish which funnels profits to subsidiaries registered in Ireland but tax-domiciled in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands and which may have saved Google alone tens of billions of dollars over a decadeThere is still plenty to lose though Ireland is particularly nervous having come to rely on its 125% rate to attract foreign investment much of it involving real people offices and factories Corporate tax now accounts for a record 20% of the country total tax take The Irish have been lobbying America the source of much of their investment against a radical reallocation of taxing rights and a minimum tax above 125% Ireland finance minister Paschal Donohoe has argued that smaller countries should be allowed to use tax policy to make up for the advantages of scale location and resources that big ones enjoyEven a minimum rate of 125% or only just above it could cost Ireland though when you factor in tax breaks Many big companies using it pay an effective rate in the single digits The country “patent box” a scheme for profits from innovation charges just 625% A firm paying that might quickly tire of Irish charms if faced with a six-percentage-point top-up The government has pencilled in an annual tax-revenue loss from the putative global deal of €2bn $25bnaround 24% of public revenue and the equivalent on a GDP basis to America losing nearly $140bnIreland has some friends in the EU Hungary with a rate of 9% is a noisy champion of tax competition Cyprus and Malta are sympathetic too though “happy to sit in Ireland shadow” says another official Outside the EU Singapore and Switzerland have signalled that they consider 15% too high The Asian hub would be happier with 10%Luxembourg and the Netherlands however have undergone Damascene conversions The Grand Duchy lambasted after a leak in 2014 exposed sweetheart tax deals with dozens of multinationals has passed reforms that narrow tax-arbitrage opportunities and increase tax-ruling transparency It says it could live with any deal that levels the playing field The Dutch government stung by public criticism of its tolerance of tax tricks has also been trying to close loopholes “We won’t be the ones who obstruct the deal” says Hans Vijlbrief the Dutch state secretary for finance “My goal is to not be mentioned any more in the list of tax paradises”That leaves Ireland and other EU malcontents in a bind They could in theory wield vetoes since the bloc tax decisions require unanimity But that looks highly unlikely given the support for change from the union big members and Americanot to mention the awful politics of blocking a deal seen by the public as necessary to force big business to pay its fair shareMoreover America and others could impose minimum taxes on their own companies even without a global deal; indeed America already has a version for intangible income albeit set at just 105% The revolution is coming barring an unexpected breakdown in talks And with it a golden era for the world tax havens may be drawing to a close A version of this article was published online on June 1st 2021

 May 29th 2021,When does transitory inflation become sustained?,AT NEARLY 43 years old the median American worker had never in her career experienced an annual rate of “core” inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices above 3%until April this year Figures published on May 28th showed that core personal-consumption-expenditure inflation a measure closely watched by the Federal Reserve rose to 31% Some economists sense the first stirrings of an outbreak of sustained high inflation like that which afflicted many countries in the 1970s But prevailing theories of inflation suggest that for now at least this threat remains remoteListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe Great Inflation as the episode in the 1970s is often called led to radical revisions in macroeconomic thinking Until then Keynesian economists believed that a permanently lower rate of unemployment could be achieved by accepting higher inflation Critics of this view like Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago thought differently In the long run they argued the unemployment rate was determined by an economy structural features A government using easy money to push joblessness below this “natural” level would fail Instead inflation would accelerate as people learned to expect faster price growthThe Great Inflation lent credibility to the critics But Friedman monetarismthe view that inflation in the long run was determined by growth in the money supplyalso proved inadequate Central banks that tried to target money growth found its relationship with inflation to be unstable They have since been guided by a hybrid “New Keynesian” framework where inflation is determined by three main factors: the effects of supply shocks; the extent to which the economy is operating above or below capacity; and people expectations of inflation The debates around the probable trajectory of inflation today hinge on these variablesStart first with supply shocks The current inflation spike is clearly rooted in disruptions relating to the messy process of reopening Supply shocks featured prominently in the Great Inflation as well which might suggest that a short-term problem can quickly become entrenched But a closer examination of that episode provides some reassurance Work by Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Jeremy Rudd of the Federal Reserve suggests that the Great Inflation in fact reflected two distinct phenomena: a persistent problem of too much demand overlaid by short bursts of supply-side pressures Shocks to food and energy markets led to dramatic spikes in inflation in the 1970s But Messrs Blinder and Rudd point out that inflation quickly dropped when these shocks abated Headline inflation in America rose by nine percentage points from 1972 to 1974 but by 1976 had fallen by seven percentage points That suggests that supply pressures today should ease when disruptions are resolvedAn economy that is operating beyond its capacity could perhaps create more enduring inflation problems Here again history is instructive Inflation had been creeping up in America well before the 1970s rising from less than 2% in the early 1960s to nearly 6% later in the decade That was the result of a policy error: the Fed consistently let demand exceed productive capacity Why it did so remains the subject of debate It may have failed to grasp that productivity growth was slowing thereby overestimating the economy potential Or it may have been reluctant to incur the social or political costs of inducing unemployment to rein in inflation It took the grim determination of Paul Volcker who became the Fed chairman in 1979 to expunge this inflationary inertiaSome economists worry that today stimulus-powered growth could lead to a repeat of the errors of the past Employment in America remains nearly 8m short of its pre-pandemic level pointing to plenty of spare capacity But even the Fed reckons that this might quickly be hoovered up with unemployment falling below its long-run rate by the end of 2022 Yet though the disappearance of slack could add to inflation pressures it may not do so by very much: shifts in unemployment seem to have had smaller effects on inflation in recent decades In fact research by Jonathon Hazell of Princeton University Juan Herreño of Columbia University and Emi Nakamura and Jon Steinsson of the University of California Berkeley suggests that this phenomenon may not be new They find that the relationship between unemployment and inflation has been fairly weak across American states since at least the late 1970s The drop in inflation that occurred on Volcker watch owed less to high unemployment they argue than to a profound shift in the public inflation expectationsWhat to expect when you’re not expectingExpectations are the trickiest piece of the inflation equation Measurement is one problem A survey by the University of Michigan suggests that consumers expect average annual inflation of 31% over the next five years; market-based measures imply a rate of about 26% over the same period before falling to about 22% over the subsequent five years That is above the Fed 2% target but still well short of a 1970s-style rerun Perhaps punters are less worried about price pressures Or perhaps they trust in the Fed commitment to price stability Mr Hazell and his co-authors posit that inflation expectations dropped dramatically in the early 1980s because the public perceived a “regime shift” at the Fed A repeat of the Great Inflation then might require another big change to central banks’ frameworks and time for the public to perceive itIs such an about-face imminent? The Fed recently amended its approach and says it will accept periods of above-target inflation to offset past undershooting Whether this represents a “regime shift” is another question The Fed still promises inflation of just 2% on average It has not dropped its commitment to keep control over prices nor does the public believe it has Middle-aged Americans may get a taste of modestly high inflation this year But they are hardly returning to the economy of their parents Editor's note May 28th 2021: This article has been updated since publication to include the latest inflation figures

In a paper published in April Ruchir Agarwal of the IMF and Tristan Reed of the World Bank argued that it might be possible to end the “acute phase” of the pandemic early next year by vaccinating 60% of the population of every country Will there be enough shots to go round? In principle yes According to Airfinity a life-sciences data firm vaccine-makers could produce as many as 111bn doses this year enough to inoculate more than 75% of the world population aged over five The manufacturers themselves say they will produce many moreSome of this capacity is already spoken for But rich countries have hogged less of it than many people fear Mr Agarwal and Mr Reed calculate that rich countries have placed advance orders for about 2bn courses many of which comprise two shots At the same time the developing world already has dibs on more vaccines than some people assume thanks to deals struck by organisations like the African Union and COVAX a vaccine-sharing initiative Mr Agarwal and Mr Reed calculate that 91 developing countries with a combined population of over 25bn people need to order only another 350m courses between them to vaccinate 60% of their population India faces a bigger shortfall But it also has the dollars and domestic manufacturing capacity to reach the target eventuallyMr Agarwal and Gita Gopinath the IMF chief economist have now turned this insight into a broader $50bn “proposal to end the covid-19 pandemic” see chart Only $4bn of the headline total is necessary to buy the 350m extra vaccination courses The rest is earmarked for other tasks such as helping countries get vaccines into people arms keeping a lookout for new variants expanding testing and treatment and adding another 1bn doses of vaccine-making capacity next year as insurance in case anything goes wrong Not everything on their wishlist is costly The two economists reckon the developing world could vaccinate almost 40% of its population by the end of 2021 if rich countries donated even half of the surplus vaccines they are likely to amass this yearThe proposal is ambitious But circumspection will only make the problems posed by the pandemic harder to fix Without firm commitments to buy vaccines manufacturers will have less reason to resolve any bottlenecks in their supply chains A scarcity of shots will encourage counterproductive bans on exports of vaccines and materials If poor countries do not know when vaccines will arrive they will find it harder to prepare a successful roll-out And slow vaccination will make new variants more likelyConversely an early end to the pandemic could add as much as $8trn at market exchange rates to global GDP spread over the next few years according to the IMF and raise tax revenues in the rich world by $1trn “Funding this proposal” the authors argue “may possibly be the highest-return public investment ever” Glory indeed Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also listen to  The Jab our podcast on the race between injections and infections and find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe and America

articles as you multitaskOKBusinesses are starting to invest in huge numbers In America capital spending or capex by companies is rising at an annual rate of 15% both on the hard stuff such as machines and factories and intangibles like software Firms in other parts of the world are also ramping up spending Forecasts for business investment have never looked so rosy Analysts at Morgan Stanley a bank predict a “red-hot capex cycle” Overall global investment they reckon will soar to 121% of pre-recession levels by the end of 2022 see chart 1 Oxford Economics a consultancy argues that “the time looks right for a boom in capex” while IHS Markit a research firm forecasts that global real fixed investment will rise by more than 6% this yearToday optimism marks quite a change from the pre-pandemic norm In America gross domestic business investment as a share of GDP had been sluggish since the early 1980s After the financial crisis of 2007-09 it took more than two years for global investment in real terms to regain its previous peak By contrast although investment fell more steeply at the start of the pandemic it has been quicker to bounce back this time The prospect of surging capex holds out promise that the global economy will not face a repeat of the 2010s when growth in productivity and GDP stayed stubbornly below pre-crisis trends Investment in new products technologies and business practices is after all the foundation for higher incomes and a better quality of life So what is behind the capex cheerand could it last?To understand why analysts are so upbeat consider the firms included in the S&P 500 America main stockmarket index Together they account for about one dollar in seven of total rich-world corporate capital formation In a recent report Bank of America analyses these companies’ earnings calls since 2006 and concludes that executives are at their most bullish about capex The Economist has looked at the biggest 25 non-financial firms in the S&P 500 and found that analysts’ expectations for capex in 2021 have risen by 10% in the past yearFor now the investment recovery is concentrated in a few industries We find that global tech firms are expected to boost capex by 42% this year relative to 2019 Apple will invest $430bn in America over a five-year period an upgrade of 20% on previous plans Taiwan TSMC the world largest semiconductor-maker recently announced that it would invest $100bn over the next three years in manufacturing Analysts reckon that Samsung capex will rise by 13% this year having gone up by 45% in 2020Tech companies are spending so freely in part because the pandemic has created new demands More shopping happens online Remote work is on the rise New equipment and software is needed for these to run smoothly Recent research by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis and Yulia Zhestkova of the University of Chicago finds a big rise in the share of patent filings for work-from-home technologies UBS another bank reckons that shipments of computers for commercial use will rise by nearly 10% this year an acceleration even over the lastTech firms are not the only enthusiastic spenders Firms in the S&P 500 that focus on discretionary consumer spending boosted capex by 36% year-on-year in the first quarter Companies such as Target and Walmart two retailers are trying to keep up with the online giants that are eating their lunch Marks & Spencer an august British retailer recently announced that it had launched 46 new websites in overseas markets from Iceland to UzbekistanOther retailers are spending frantically to expand capacity having been caught out by the surge in household spending Everything from sofas to hot tubs is in short supply Earlier this year Peloton announced “substantial incremental investments” in expediting the transport of its exercise bikes from Taiwan Maersk a shipping firm recently said it would buy more containers to ease bottlenecks The global order-book for enormous container ships has risen from 9% of the existing fleet in October to over 15% in AprilThe big question is whether the emerging capex boom augurs a broad and lasting shift away from the weakness of the 2010s or is simply an enthusiastic but temporary response to reopening Not everyone is boosting capex: our analysis suggests that about half of the companies in the S&P 500 are not expected to invest more in 2021 than they did in 2019 Global oil-and-gas firms are cutting back by a tenth relative to pre-pandemic levels possibly in response to lower expected demand for their planet-warming fare Airline operators are also dialling down spending perhaps because they expect it to be a while before people can travel freely again Many executives including those from raw-materials and industrial-goods firms continue to preach capital discipline It may be quite a leap for them to go from a decade of austerity to boom timeAnother worry is the trend towards greater consolidation in industries from hotels to mining which seems unlikely to have been reversed by covid-19 Research by the IMF suggests that companies with market power may be less keen on investing In the five years before the pandemic for instance American business investment in hotels was barely higher than it was in the five years before the financial crisis even though demand was far higherSet against that though economic conditions today could convince reluctant companies to loosen the purse-strings In contrast to the post-financial-crisis period households have a lot of savings to spend A more decisive fiscal and monetary response this time has also allowed firms to load up on cash see chart 2 Bond issuance by investment-grade-rated American companies jumped to a record $17trn in 2020 up from $11trn in 2019 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence a research outfitMoreover the economic reallocation provoked by covid-19 and its investment implications will be felt for some time Managers in certain industries especially semiconductors already accept that they went into the pandemic with too little spare capacity and are promising multi-year projects to make up for it Perhaps most important the pandemic is leading to an era of greater technological optimism The rapid deployment of entirely new business models when covid-19 struck not to mention vaccine discovery may have reminded bosses of the payoff to investing All that might explain why the expectations for capex by S&P 500 firms in 2022 are even more ambitious than those for this year

 May 24th 2021,What America hot housing market means for consumer prices,THE AMERICAN economy last year may have suffered its deepest downturn since the Depression but you would not know it from house prices The Case-Shiller national house-price index is rising at an annual rate of 13% its fastest for more than 15 years see chart Lower interest rates have encouraged people to take out bigger mortgages and trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus have let people spend more on housingListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet as prices have breezed ahead rental growth which usually follows suit has sharply slowed And whether rents catch up or not matters because they play an outsize role in America consumer-price inflation statistics In a recent note analysts at Goldman Sachs a bank ranked housing costs among their three main “upside” risks to inflation together with wages and inflation expectations Alan Detmeister of UBS another bank went further arguing that “it is only a small exaggeration to say that there is no single variable on which global financial markets depend more this year than US rents” The behaviour of rental inflation could influence the Federal Reserve decision to withdraw its support for the economywhich would in turn affect everything from the strength of America recovery to the valuations of an array of assetsAmerica statisticians like those across the rich world do not include house prices in inflation metrics: the thinking runs that house purchases are in large part an investment rather than purely a consumption good Instead they focus on two other measures of housing costs One is the rents actually paid by tenants The other is an estimate of what homeowners would need to pay in order to rent their house Despite boomy prices rents are rising at just 2% a year about half the pace seen just before the pandemicEconomists puzzle over this divergence Americans’ growing fondness for homeownership means more competition for owner-occupied properties but less for tenancies Renters are more likely than homeowners to have lost their jobs in the past year and may thus have negotiated rent holidays or discounts Some landlords in San Francisco are so desperate for new tenants that they are even offering bonuses to people who sign a leaseOver the long run however economic theory suggests that rents and prices should move in tandem ie the ratio of house prices to rents should be stable If rental growth catches up with prices that could have a big effect Rents make up one-fifth of the basket used to calculate “core” personal-consumption-expenditure PCE inflation which excludes food and energythe gauge most closely watched by the Fed If annual rent inflation rose to 4% a yearnot far off where it was shortly before the pandemicoverall core inflation would rise by 05 percentage pointsCould this happen? As the economy recovers landlords may hope to make up for lost time “We expect a rental-market resurgence in 2021” said Zillow a property firm in a report in December “with rents increasingand demand for rental housing strengthening” A recovery in low-wage employment should boost rents: housing-cost inflation tends to rise when the unemployment rate falls A survey by the New York Fed in April found that households expected rents to rise by 10% in the coming year up from expectations of 5% on average in 2020Rental inflation is thus likely to rise in the coming months But by how much is another question There are reasons to think the price-to-rent ratio could settle at a permanently higher level When interest rates are so low for instance people are willing to pay more for the right to a given stream of income American price-to-rent ratios are higher today than in the 1980s which coincides with declines in real interest ratesA slower pace of housing construction may also keep price-to-rent ratios higher suggests a new paper by Christian Hilber of the London School of Economics and Andreas Mense of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg In thriving areas where the supply of housing is constrained buyers may be willing to bid up prices in the expectation of strong rental growth in the future In recent years America has become worse at building new houses in part because of tougher land-use regulationsAmerican price-to-rent ratios could of course adjust in another waythrough prices falling rather than rents rising Just as share prices are more volatile than dividends house prices are more up-and-down than rents And Mr Detmeister historical analysis suggests that two-thirds of any adjustment in price-to-rent ratios tends to fall on prices In other words America might be able to have either a strong housing market or quiescent inflationbut not both A version of this article was published online on May 24th 2021
 May 20th 2021,How covid-19 could impede the catch-up of poor countries with rich ones,IT ONCE SEEMED possible that covid-19 might deliver a softer blow to poor economies than rich ones Instead the virus seems likely to set the emerging world back in its quest to attain advanced-economy incomes Real GDP per person in America shrank by about 4% in 2020 only about half a percentage point more than the average across emerging markets in purchasing-power-parity terms But projections made by the IMF in April suggest that American growth is set to outpace that in the emerging world this year; with the pandemic still ravaging places like Brazil and India poor-country growth will probably lag even further behind More worrying still the pandemic may reshape the global economy in ways that make continued convergence towards rich-world incomes a tougher slog Worse prospects for poor countries will in turn make managing future crises from pandemics to climate change harder The rich world should take noteListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEconomists once reckoned that incomes in poorer economies should naturally catch up to those in richer ones based on experience in Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries when industrial laggards caught up to and frequently overtook Britain Backward countries could borrow the latest know-how from leading ones the thinking went and their limited capital base promised hefty returns to investors In the 1950s two economists Robert Solow and Trevor Swan separately developed models of economic growth in which higher returns to capital in poorer countries than in rich ones lead to more investment generating faster growth and convergence As scholars gathered more data on more countries however it became clear that the 20th century was not a period of convergence but rather of “divergence big time” in the words of Lant Pritchett of Oxford UniversityThen just as economists had all but given up on the idea of convergence poorer countries began outgrowing rich ones in an extraordinary way Between 1985 and 1995 incomes per person in the emerging world fell behind those in rich countries at a rate of 05% per year according to a new paper by Michael Kremer of the University of Chicago Jack Willis of Columbia University and Yang You of the University of Hong Kong But from 2005 to 2015 incomes converged at a rate of 07% per year Slower growth in the rich world aided the shift but more important was a broad acceleration in poor-country growth Crucially the share of developing economies experiencing disastrous downturns shrank dramatically according to recent work by Dev Patel of Harvard University and Justin Sandefur and Arvind Subramanian of the Centre for Global Development Average annual growth rates were negative in 42% of low-income countries in the 1980s compared with only 16% in the 2000s and 2010sThis turn in fortunes had enormous consequences for matters from global poverty which has tumbled over the past generation to geopolitics Yet economists are not certain why growth suddenly took off and thus struggle to assess how likely convergence is to continue Even before the pandemic there were puzzling trends Low-income countries outgrew high-income ones by 15 percentage points a year in the 2000s and middle-income countries did better still but the gap shrank to just 065 percentage points in the 2010s Convergence also became less widespread geographically as the 2010s wore on While incomes in Asian and European emerging economies continued to gain on those in America Latin America the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa began to fall further behind around 2013The decline in real output per person in 2020 erased roughly a decade worth of income gains in those lagging regions Some countries might quickly recover those losses though plodding vaccinations and continued outbreaks complicate matters Rising commodity prices could boost the fortunes of exporters of natural resources while the migration of more services online after covid-19 could open up opportunities for trade In some ways developing countries have also become more economically resilient Mr Kremer and his co-authors examine 32 indicators of the quality of governance macroeconomic policy and financial development and find that for 29 of them performance improved more in poorer countries than in rich ones between 1985 and 2015 Convergence also took place across measures of culture such as survey-based attitudes towards inequality and work Having become more like rich countries poor places may find it easier than in the past to maintain stable growth as rich economies tend toYet other factors that buoyed growth in the 2000s and 2010ssuch as rapid Chinese development and the explosion in trade associated with the spread of global supply chainscannot easily be repeated Rich-world worries about supply-chain reliability exacerbated by the logistical bottlenecks now besetting the global economy could in fact bring some trade retrenchment Perhaps most worrying is the possibility that the trauma of the pandemic could fan political and social instability particularly in lagging regions undermining the basis for stable growthClosing argumentsPoor countries can scarcely afford such setbacks Even at the pace of catch-up of the past two decades it would take the average developing economy about 170 years to close half its income gap say Mr Patel and co-authors Recent growth has not much reduced the poor world dependence on rich-world benevolence as a yawning gap in vaccination rates demonstrates And the costs of climate change only loomRapid growth earlier in this century encouraged rich-world governments to see developing countries more as lucrative markets or strategic rivals than charity cases But poor places remain more vulnerable to crises And with every crisis attaining stable growth becomes even harder Rich-world policy on matters from trade to aid must take this into account Dig deeperAll our

 May 20th 2021,The global chip shortage is here for some time,FOR WANT of a chip the factory was lost On May 18th Toyota became the latest carmaker forced to cut production amid a global shortage of microchips announcing it would suspend work at two of its plants in Japan Firms including Ford General Motors and Jaguar Land Rover have also had to send workers homeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe pain is not confined to the car industry for the shortage spans all sorts of chips from the expensive high-tech devices that power smartphones and data centres to the simple sensors and microcontrollers that have become a vital commodity scattered across everything from cars to washing machines and often costing just a few cents each In the past few weeks companies including Foxconn Nintendo and Samsung have warned of hits to production affecting everything from smartphones and games consoles to televisions and home broadband routersGovernments are worried America called a summit in April; another is due on May 20th Germany finance minister has written to the government of Taiwan where many chipmakers are based lobbying for priority for carmakers A report from Gavekal Research a consultancy published on May 4th said the shortage might soon hit export performance in several East Asian economies But there is little that ministers can do The chip drought is the result of the covid-19 pandemic interacting with an industry that is notoriously prone to cycles of boom and bust It is likely to persist for months if not years“The most important thing [to recognise]” says Malcolm Penn who runs Future Horizons a chip-industry consultancy “is that shortages are a natural part of the industry” Chipmaking he says is a good example of what economists call a “pork-cycle” business named for the regular swings between under- and over-supply first analysed in American pork markets in the 1920s As with pigs the supply of chips cannot quickly react to changes in demand Capacity was tight even before the pandemic says Mr Penn pointing out that investment by chipmakers in factory equipment has been below its long-term average for many years see chartThe pandemic thus arrived at the worst possible time After an early crash demand in several segments boomed says Alan Priestley of Gartner another consultancy Locked-down consumers bought laptops and other gadgets Cloud-computing operators which are big consumers of high-end chips scrambled to add servers to deal with the wave of home-workers The car industry was particularly badly hit by a decision to cut orders early in the pandemic Demand for cars has since recovered But the complexities of the production process means it takes three to four months to turn a blank silicon wafer into a usable batch of chips “I can cancel my orders in an afternoon” says Mr Penn “If I want to start them up again that takes monthsand anyway that capacity is now busy serving other customers”The impact of the pandemic in turn has been made worse by industry-specific problems In March a chip plant owned by Renesas a Japanese firm caught fire piling pain on the car industry Some chipmakers meanwhile face shortages of their own Many cheap workaday parts are made in older factories designed to process silicon wafers that are 200mm in diameter or even smaller These days 300mm is the standard Efforts to boost capacity are stymied by the fact that few toolmakers still make the old-style machines says Mr Priestley The market for second-hand 200mm tools meanwhile has been stripped bareBut the pork cycle is turning once again Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the world biggest contract chipmaker plans to spend $30bn on new capacity this year alone Samsung Electronics and Intel two other giants have pencilled in $28bn and $20bn respectively; second-tier chipmakers are ramping up spending too That will bring relief to the wider economy says Mr Priestley but not immediately On May 14th Jim Whitehurst the boss of IBM a computer-maker said he thought the shortages might last for two years And says Mr Penn when the drought eventually ends chipmakers may find they face a familiar problem but on a bigger scale: a capacity splurge in response to serious shortages today could well mean a sizeable glut tomorrow 
 May 20th 2021,Learning to live without LIBOR,A RESTAURANT CHAIN in Huntsville Alabama draws an extra few thousand dollars from its working-capital facility with a local bank Meanwhile its employees’ pension scheme needs to convert the variable interest rate on $10bn of its assets into a fixed revenue stream The scheme agrees to an interest-rate swap with a hedge fund which wants to bet on the Federal Reserve raising rates It places the wager using a margin loan from its prime broker one of Wall Street larger banksListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEach transaction needs a benchmark to decide what interest rate should be charged The bizarre thing is that they all use the same one: the London interbank offered rate LIBOR an estimate of the rate at which big banks in London lend to each other in an obscure corner of the money markets Every day it gives borrowing costs for each of five currencies for periods ranging from overnight to a year Those for the dollar alone are used to determine the interest rates on $223trn of debt and derivativesmore than two-and-a-half times annual global GDP But the benchmark is not long for this world Fixings for the euro sterling Swiss franc and yen will be discontinued at the end of 2021 and those for the dollar in June 2023 What will replace them?LIBOR is best known for a scandal that broke in 2012 when it emerged that banks and traders had been illicitly manipulating it for years That had become even easier after the market it was meant to measure all but evaporated For most of the five decades since its invention banks used unsecured loans from their peers as a source of day-to-day funding But these dried up during the financial crisis of 2007-09 and never returned to anything like their previous volume An interbank lending market with daily transactions of around $500m now underpins contracts pegged to dollar LIBOR that are worth about 450000 times that This disparity led regulators to call time on LIBOR in 2017The most striking feature of the transition is the diversity of the candidates to replace it Start with the leading alternatives in each of LIBOR five currencies Those are the secured overnight financing rate SOFR for the dollar the sterling overnight index average SONIA for the pound the Tokyo overnight average rate TONAR for the yen the Swiss average rate overnight SARON for the Swiss franc and the euro short-term rate €STR for the euro All are so-called “near-risk-free” rates which measure the cost of overnight lending But they do this in different ways which reflect local funding conditions British European and Japanese banks lean on unsecured deposits for their day-to-day liquidity So SONIA €STR and TONAR are daily averages of the rates banks pay on such deposits But big American and Swiss banks tend to rely more on repos secured loans collateralised by government bonds So SOFR and SARON measure transactions in these markets insteadFurther fragmentation is emerging within the dollar market SOFR is less useful for the regional bank in Alabama that lends to local businesses since it is unlikely to be a heavy user of repos Such lenders tend to be more reliant on short-term unsecured debt not dissimilar to that underpinning LIBOR albeit at rates set for small banks in the local market rather than big ones in London Hence the creation of AMERIBOR an index that measures borrowing costs of small medium and regional banks in America Two indices produced by Bloomberg a financial-data firm and by the Intercontinental Exchange ICE aim to perform a similar function for larger banks that derive some of their funding from long-dated bonds rather than short-term repos and that wish to lend using a benchmark that reflects their normal borrowing costsThese alternatives to SOFR may be better tailored to certain types of lenders but they come with two drawbacks The first is that they might be too LIBOR-like Thomas Wipf of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee ARRC a body convened by the Federal Reserve to steer the dollar market transition warns against relying on reference rates that may share LIBOR shortcomings A bespoke index representing banks’ funding costs may seem like a fine idea until a liquidity crunch hits and the transactions underpinning it dry up making it unstable in times of stress SOFR which is based on over $1trn of daily repo transactions was chosen by the ARRC to avoid precisely this eventuality By contrast AMERIBOR and ICE Bank Yield Index are underpinned by transactions worth $25bn and $15bn respectivelyThe second concern is liquidity and hence trading costs in the markets indexed to the more tailored benchmarks Under LIBORand in the future SOFRthe restaurant chain in Huntsville has access to the same derivative market as the hedge fund That vast trading pool means that small businesses can buy contracts to protect themselves from rising interest rates relatively cheaply AMERIBOR might hew more closely to the regional lender funding costs but trading debt and derivatives linked to this niche yardstick is likely to be slower and more expensiveThese flaws could mean that some of the new benchmarks fall into disuse Yet on balance the constellation of successors to LIBOR seems like a good thing It is fundamental to the concept of debt that borrowing costs depend on who you are who your lender is and which currency you borrow in The new measures should do a better job than a relic with little relevance for today financial system 
 May 20th 2021,How to gauge investors’ fear of inflation,WHAT DO INVESTORS fear most? In the Bank of America long-running survey of fund managers the tail risk that has mostly preoccupied them until recently has been the pandemic In this month survey though inflation rose to the top of the list of worries It is not hard to see why High inflation if sustained would require central banks to act decisively to contain it That would mean the end of the low interest rates that have underpinned the prices of an array of expensive-looking assets from stocks and bonds to propertyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSurveys are one thing The bets investors make are another The VIX or volatility index is the best-known market gauge of fear It tracks the cost of insuring against extreme moves in American share prices and is widely used by banks and asset managers as a guide to managing risk in general Yet the VIX does not get directly to what presently worries investors For that you need to consult a less-celebrated oraclethe MOVE or Merrill Lynch Options Volatility Estimate a market-based measure of uncertainty about interest rates It has the stronger claim to being the true fear index If it spikes it means bond investors have been gripped by raw terrorThe outlook for inflation is unclear On the one hand the form book says there is no reason to worry For much of the past decade and more the Federal Reserve and other central banks have consistently over-forecast inflation and under-shot their inflation targets Jumps in inflation such as the one recorded last month as America economy reopened in earnest have usually proved transitory On the other hand present conditions seem fertile for inflation The pressure on aggregate demand is fuelled not only by loose monetary policy but by hefty fiscal stimulus In the face of this more insistent spending businesses’ rules of thumb about which kind of workers to hire how much to pay and how quickly to add capacity may prove faulty Inflation might upset the form bookIf inflation is uncertain so is the path for interest rates Forecasts of monetary policy are reflected in the slope of the bond-yield curve and in interest-rate futures The range of uncertainty around these expectations is embedded in options prices A financial option is the right to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on or before a specified maturity date Options are particularly valuableand expensivewhen investors are more uncertain or more fearful about the future The level of market anxiety or uncertainty can thus be extracted from their prices These are the raw material for the MOVE index which is derived from options on two- five- ten- and thirty-year TreasuriesThe MOVE is expressed in basis points explains Harley Bassman who invented the index If say interest rates are 5% and the MOVE is 100 it means that most 68% or one standard deviation of a normal distribution of the time interest rates are expected to lie between 4% and 6% At present the index is in the fifties which is low relative to its history and much lower than at times of extreme market stress see chart This is partly technical says Mr Bassman With interest rates not far from zero and the Fed seemingly disinclined to ever take them negative the scope for volatility in Treasuries is somewhat curtailed Another explanation is that people believe the Fed when it says it will not change its monetary-policy settings for a while That expectation lowers the implied volatility on two-year Treasuries which drags on the overall MOVE indexEven so the MOVE seems very likely to rise againand perhaps sharply The Fed will get beyond the sitting-on-hands phase The market is betting that interest rates will rise in early 2023 after the Fed has first announced and then completed a tapering of its bond purchases How far the MOVE will eventually move will depend on how transitory inflation looks to the bond markets and how in control of the situation the Fed seems Many already swear by the index A sharp rise in it is often a cue for panicky sales of the riskier sort of assets and a general repricing of individual securities says Kevin Russell of UBS O’Connor the hedge-fund unit of the Swiss asset manager That is because if investors grow less certain about interest rates they also lose confidence about where value is in the credit or equity marketsFor the rest of us the MOVE is the best proxy for something that matters a lot given the growing fears of inflation The advantage of a single-number gauge is simplicity And the MOVE is now the one to watch

An obvious explanation is the rise of investing focused on environmental social and governance ESG factors Global flows into ESG funds topped $178bn in the first quarter of this year up from $38bn in the same quarter last year according to Morningstar a research firm see chart 3 ESG funds accounted for 24% of total fund inflows so far this year up from 11% in 2018 On average about two new ESG-focused funds are launched each dayMany of these are indeed loading up on green stocks Credit Suisse a bank tracked the holdings of 100 ESG funds over the past year Among the five most-purchased companies were Orsted and Vestas Wind a wind-turbine-maker Yet only a subset of the funds accounting for about a tenth of ESG assets under management focused on clean-energy firms The rest invested more widely The top 50 holdings of the world 20 biggest ESG-labelled funds included only two of our green firms Many of the top ten holdings were in fact tech companies such as Microsoft and Alibaba This is partly because fund managers often use ESG ratings to gauge if a firm is climate-friendly or socially upstanding and big companies with the resources to devote to disclosure tend to rank more highlyConventional fund managers however are also going green Morningstar looked at the investors in 30 clean-energy businesses At the end of 2020 each firm was held by 138 sustainable funds on average up from 81 a year earlier The number of non-ESG holders also increased from 390 to 624 Investing in clean energy says Jessica Alsford of Morgan Stanley a bank is “no longer a niche topic”A changing climateThe enthusiasm reflects two trends For a start many clean-energy firms are now more viable The prices of some technologies have fallen dramatically making them competitive with fossil-fuel firms The cost of solar power has shrunk by around 80% in the past decade That of lithium-ion batteries which power EVs is falling by about 20% a year Moreover with America China and the EU setting “net-zero” emissions targets investors sense that green regulation is here to stay Pension funds for example which hold a lot of oil firms have started to hedge that risk by buying clean-energy stocks says Bruce Jenkyn-Jones of Impax an asset managerThe green hype has also been fuelled by financial fads Retail investing has surged and punters seem excited about new clean technologies Among the 20 most popular companies on Robinhood an app for day traders are Tesla and Plug Power a firm that makes hydrogen-fuel cells Venkatesh Thallam an independent researcher notes that a handful of clean-energy firms feature on WallStreetBets Green special-purpose acquisition vehicles  SPACs a novel way for companies to list on stockmarkets have also proliferated Of the 800-odd SPACs that have listed since 2019 about a tenth have focused on sustainabilityThe emergence of meme stocks and SPACs raises fears of a green bubble especially as 30% of firms in our portfolio are loss-making To gauge the degree of frothiness The Economist has looked at two ratios: price-to-earnings what the market thinks a company is worth relative to its earnings and price-to-book which compares prices to net assetsThese suggest that the degree of froth varies across green stocks The median price-to-earnings ratio of renewable-power firms is about that of the S&P 500 By contrast EV firms have a median price-to-earnings ratio roughly twice that of the wider index As most hydrogen and fuel-cell firms in our portfolio are not yet making money price-to-earnings ratios cannot be calculated But their price-to-book ratio is about 50% above the market averageThe difference in valuations is explained by variations in the maturity of both the underlying technology and the market Wind and solar firms began to expand in the 2000s aided by generous government subsidies Over time the technologies improved and the subsidies shrank The sectors also consolidated;

It helps that watchdogs in America have been setting out what services banks can provide Last year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they could offer custodial services for crypto assets The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regards bitcoin and other digital currencies as commodities enabling banks to trade derivatives linked to themThe main reason for banks’ enthusiasm though is obsessive interest from some customers A year ago Itay Tuchman Citigroup foreign-exchange chief hardly ever fielded calls on crypto from institutional clients Now he receives them several times a week he says Roman Regelman of BNY Mellon deems the craze “an opportunity but also an imperative” Wealthy clients are pulling money out of private banks and retail punters out of current accounts to bet on digital currencies through fintech firms and startups Many would rather do everything with their banks which in turn hope to reap the rewards in customer fees and dataPerhaps the easiest service to offer is derivatives trading as Goldman now does providing clients with exposure to the assets without having to buy them Then comes custody: the storage and related book-keeping of assets on behalf of big investors This requires investing in technology; the few banks already selling custody subcontract tasks to specialist firmsBut it is the next level of services where banks hold digital assets on their balance-sheets either as collateral or by trading in spot markets that is currently beyond reach After a day like May 19th when bitcoin lost nearly a third of its value in a few hours regulators may ensure it stays that way Even if banks do not trade directly says Chris Zuehlke of Cumberland a Chicago-based firm that helped Goldman execute its first big “block” trade of crypto futures on May 6th they could still connect clients to large spot traders acting as the shopfront but relying on the infrastructure and balance-sheets of othersBanks insist that most clients expect a rollercoaster ride But a prolonged rout could still scare off prospective converts and trigger a regulatory crackdown Wall Street has an unrivalled ability to bring liquidity and distribution muscle to new assets Anyone wanting to work out the fate of crypto-investing might do well to see what the banks do next A version of this article was published online on May 19th 2021
 May 15th 2021,David Swensen an influential investor died on May 5th,STARTING IN THE 1980s the endowments of a handful of big American universities began to divert their investments away from publicly traded equities and bonds towards “alternative” assets such as venture capital and private equity David Swensen who died on May 5th aged 67 perfected the approach Referred to variously as the endowment Yale or Swensen model it has since been copiedby family offices sovereign-wealth funds and more recently by big pension fundsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn 1985 Mr Swensen was persuaded by James Tobin a Nobel-prizewinning Yale economist to give up a lucrative career on Wall Street to return to his former university to run its investment office Yale endowment was then worth around $1bn By the middle of last year the figure had risen to $31bn Even this astonishing growth understates Mr Swensen influence He was responsible for developing a stream of talented asset managers at Yale And in two best-selling books he set down his investment philosophy for a wider audienceThree pillars of this thinking stand out The first concerns time horizon Because endowments have obligations stretching far into the future they can take a long-term view They can sacrifice the ease of trading in public markets for the better returns promised in private equity By doing so they can earn an illiquidity premiuma reward for giving up the ability to sell out easilyThe second pillar concerns information It is hard to find mispriced stocks in the public markets because news about listed companies travels fast and is quickly incorporated into prices But investors in private markets who do their homework are more likely to be rewarded That is because reliable data and analysis are much harder to come byThe third pillar is the importance of a contrarian mindset Mr Swensen had a chance early on to demonstrate his Following the stockmarket crash in October 1987 he had loaded up on company shares which had become much cheaper by selling bonds which had risen in price This rebalancing was in line with the fund agreed policy But set against the prevailing market gloom it looked rash His investment committee was worried One member warned that there would be “hell to pay” if Yale got it wrong But Mr Swensen stuck to his guns The decision stoodand paid off handsomelyThese days the Swensen model is often reduced to an asset-allocation decision: hold alternatives But as money has flooded into private-equity funds average returns have converged on the returns in public markets There is no longer an obvious illiquidity premium But Mr Swensen point about information remains relevant The dispersion of returnsthe gap between the best and worst fundsis far higher in private than in public equity Selecting the right private-equity manager takes expertise Yale has some advantages: it can say tap into its alumni network for access to the better-run fundsMr Swensen is given too much credit in one regard Endowments had a history of innovation before his return to Yale Harvard was already changing And endowments had previously been pioneers in asset allocation: the Ivy League funds shifted markedly from bonds into equities from the 1930s In other respects Mr Swensen gets too little credit Star investors are generally not good at mentoring others But Swensen alumni have regularly turned up in senior jobs at other endowments “He was a smart player but also an incredibly good coach” says a colleague In this as in other matters of investment practice David Swensen was a true outlier 
 May 13th 2021,Who bears the burden of a corporate tax?,JOE BIDEN wants to rebuild America and he reckons that American firms can help foot the bill Central to the president grand infrastructure-investment push is a plan to raise the tax rate on corporate income from 21% to 28% though he has hinted he may settle for less Although the administration pitches its tax proposals as a way to redress the problem that “those at the top are not doing their part” opponents warn that corporate-tax rises do not simply fall on wealthy shareholders but also shrink the pay packets of the working people the president claims to champion In fact workers often do bear some of the burden of increases in corporate taxesthough understanding just how much is a question that continues to vex economists Nonetheless the details of Mr Biden tax plans suggest that they may prove more worker-friendly than the usual effort to squeeze juice from AppleListen to this story Enjoy more audio and

corporate profits should hit shareholdersa group wealthier than the population as a wholeby shrinking the money available for dividend payments or reducing share values But other things are never equal Firms invariably respond to new taxes in order to minimise their costs Depending on precisely how they seek to escape the tax some of its burden may be passed on to others A seminal paper published in 1962 by Arnold Harberger an economist reckoned that such wriggling by owners of capital was unlikely to shift the cost of a corporate tax onto other inputs to production He imagined an economy with just two sectors corporate and non-corporate and then supposed that a tax was placed on the income of the former Capital he reasoned should shift from the corporate sector to the non-corporate consisting of partnerships and other sorts of business As a consequence the average rate of return on capital in non-corporate firms should fall reflecting the flow of resources to lower-yielding sorts of production made attractive only because of the sector comparatively favourable tax status Corporations could shift some of the burden of corporate tax to owners of capital in other parts of the economy but not pass it on to workersMr Harberger model made a number of simplifying assumptions however He assumed for instance that markets were perfectly competitive In practice firms may enjoy market power over either workers in which case some of the cost of the tax may be absorbed by wages rather than just profits or consumers who may face higher prices Perhaps most important Mr Harberger assumed that the economy in question was closed In practice capital is relatively mobile across national bordersand intangible forms like intellectual property extremely sowhile other factors of production like labour are not Increasing corporate tax in one country might then encourage owners of capital to move activity abroad diminishing the amount of capital per worker at home and potentially reducing workers’ productivity and pay Indeed research by Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University and Lawrence Summers of Harvard University showed that in very small very open economies the burden of a rise in corporate-income tax could fall almost entirely on labourThe size of an economy and its openness to capital flows are just two of the five factors that most influence an economic model conclusions regarding the incidence of corporate-tax changes argued Jennifer Gravelle Stratton then of the Congressional Budget Office in a paper published in 2013 Size matters because changes in the capital stock of larger economies have a greater influence on the worldwide return on capital Another factor is how seamlessly production may be moved abroad in response to tax changes Similarly the ease with which labour may be substituted for capital determines how badly workers’ economic prospects are affected when capital flees the country or threatens to Last who pays most depends critically on how capital-intensive the corporate sector is: the greater the level of capital per worker the more each worker suffers if a corporate-tax rise affects where firms choose to deploy their capitalSorting out the likely effects of a corporate-tax change in other words is complicated and messy Empirical studies demonstrate exactly that A paper published in 2015 by Kevin Hassett later a chairman of President Donald Trump Council of Economic Advisers and Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tank concluded that a 1% rise in the corporate-tax rate is associated with a 05% drop in wages: a result that implies that more than 100% of the burden of corporate tax lands on workers At the other end of the scale a study of economies in the OECD a club of mostly rich countries by Kimberly Clausing an economist at Reed College who is now a deputy assistant secretary at America Treasury Department found no clear relationship between corporate tax and wagesPassing the buckOther studies suggest the burden is shared An analysis of the German economy published in 2017 which used variations in local business-tax rates to assess how their costs were distributed concluded that more than half the burden is borne by workers Economists who summarise the literature often note that labour bears some but not all of the burden of corporate taxperhaps about 40%while occasionally allowing that the true figure depends heavily on the context of a given tax measureContext however is subject to change Reducing differences in corporate-tax rates across countries gives companies less scope to pass the tax burden on to workers by shifting production abroad The Biden administration proposal for a global minimum rate is in large part targeted at firms that use accounting tricks to book profits in tax havens Yet it should also deter governments’ efforts to lure production by undercutting other countries’ tax rates That would ensure that more of the burden of corporate tax falls where it is meant to

 May 13th 2021,What could a new system for taxing multinationals look like?,FOR YEARS governments have grumbled simmered and raged as multinational companies have shifted profits out of tax collectors’ grasp and into low-tax havens The OECD a club of mostly rich countries estimated in 2015 that avoidance robs public coffers of $100bn-240bn or 4-10% of global corporation-tax revenues a year Now the fiscal fallout from covid-19 is adding urgency to governments’ efforts to claw some money backmost notably in America where President Joe Biden plans to raise taxes on corporate profits including foreign incomeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Biden proposals will grind their way through Congress Finance ministers from the G7 group of countries are likely to discuss global tax reform when they meet in London on June 4th-5th And later in the summer 139 countries will discuss changing the system for taxing multinational companies The confluence of a political shift in America and a global push to raise more tax revenue to pay for the pandemic means a degree of optimism is in the air The proposals under discussion may initially raise only a modest amount of revenue but they still represent a big break with the pastThe foundations of the global corporate-tax system were laid a century ago It recognises that overlapping taxes on the same slice of profits can curb trade and growth As a result taxing rights are allocated first to wherever profits are produced the “source” and then to wherever the parent company is headquartered or “resident” A multinational based in America but with an affiliate in Ireland for example typically pays taxes in both places Where the company makes its sales is irrelevant Payments between an individual firm various legal affiliates are recorded using the “arm-length” principle supposedly on terms equivalent to those found on the open marketThese principles now baked into thousands of bilateral tax treaties have had two unintended consequences First they have encouraged governments to compete for investment and revenue by offering tantalisingly low tax rates see chart 1 In 1985 the global average statutory corporation-tax rate was 49%; in 2018 it was 24% Ireland boasts a statutory rate of just 125%; Bermuda 0% Second tax competition has encouraged companies to shuffle their reported profits to low-tax places In 2016 around $1trn of global profits were booked in so-called “investment hubs” These include the Cayman Islands Ireland and Singapore which apply an average effective tax rate of 5% on the profits of non-resident companiesThere is a huge mismatch between where tax is paid and where real activity takes place Analysis by the OECD suggests that multinationals report 25% of their profits in investment hubs although only 11% of their tangible assets and less than 5% of their workers are based there Parents can allocate paper profits to affiliates in tax havens by having them hold intellectual property that is then licensed to other affiliates in high-tax places The problem seems to have worsened over time perhaps because more firms make money from intangible services from software to streaming videos The share of American multinationals’ foreign profits booked in tax havens has risen from 30% two decades ago to about 60% today Most investors and bosses view firms’ tax bills as a black box that only a few lawyers and tax experts truly understandOne way of capturing the scale of manipulation is to examine what would happen if there were a single common tax rate A recent study by Thomas Torslov of Kraka a Danish think-tank and Ludvig Wier and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California Berkeley tried to quantify this A staggering $670bn in paper profits which are unconnected to things like factories would have moved in 2016almost 40% of multinationals’ foreign earnings Big Western countries are losers from the current system: profits in America and France for instance are depressed by around a fifth see chart 2 By comparison havens collect more revenue as a share of GDP despite their rock-bottom effective rates Hong Kong collects a third of its corporate-tax receipts by attracting profits from high-tax countries; Ireland over halfThe rise of Silicon Valley has added fuel to the fire Some governments gripe at giant firms serving customers without any physical presence in their country and while paying no tax The problems posed by the tech firms are not in fact new: pharmaceutical companies have long held mobile and hard-to-value intellectual property; exporters do not incur tax liabilities where they sell Still digital services have become a target More than 40 governments from France to India are either levying or planning to levy digital-services taxes on the revenue of firms such as Amazon Google and FacebookThe growing sense of anarchy over how to tax Silicon Valley the global desire to raise more tax revenues and a more conciliatory White House all mean the scene is set for a global deal The OECD forthcoming summit is not the first time it has tried to orchestrate reformsit helped pass changes to the transfer-pricing regime in 2015 But this time two more ambitious proposals are under discussionThe first would reallocate taxing rights so that a slice of profits could be levied according to say the location of a company sales That right could be incurred even if the company had no physical presence in the country Mr Biden negotiators have proposed a reallocation that would apply to the 100 biggest and most profitable companies worldwide; in return the Biden administration wants all the digital-services taxes to be dropped The second element would apply a minimum rate of corporation tax putting a floor on the race to the bottom The Biden administration is gunning for a global minimum tax rate on foreign earnings of 21% applied to profits within each jurisdiction separatelyYou say you want a revolutionCould these ideas form the basis for an eventual deal? The proposal for profit reallocation has been broadly welcomed by other big rich economies Yet there is still plenty of scope for disagreement on the details Assessing the location of sales made by one business to another if it then goes on to make sales in a different country is tricky Some governments also still want to turn the screws on Amazon Apple Facebook Google and the like: the European Union seems to be preparing to go ahead with a digital levy regardless of the outcome at the OECD That in turn could cause some American lawmakers to eschew global co-operation Meanwhile many tax havens may resist higher minimum tax rates that eliminate the advantage for companies of booking profits thereAs a result any deal will involve compromises The amount of profit that is reallocated in order to resemble economic reality more closely could be capped For example the OECD blueprint does take the radical step of considering companies as a whole rather than separated into affiliates Still most profits would remain taxed as they are The right to tax say 20% of profits above a routine rate of 10% of revenues would be reallocated according to a formula that could be based on sales Meanwhile America preferred minimum rate of 21% is unlikely to be agreed on more widely as countries sniff about tax sovereignty A rate of 10-15% is much more realisticHow much difference would changes of this magnitude make? The reallocation plan as it stands aims to raise a puny $5bn-12bn in annual revenues The OECD reckons that a minimum rate of 125% would raise $23bn-42bn directly through the higher rate and another $19bn-28bn by reducing profit-shifting These figures are not particularly impressive although they might let governments crank up domestic tax rates without worrying as much about the danger of capital flightStill an agreement on new principles could leave the door open to bolder changes later Carlos Protto one of Argentina representatives in theOECD talks says that focusing only on the biggest multinationals helps build consensus now but also notes that many countries expect the scope of any reforms to be broadened eventuallyWhat if countries cannot agree? America will forge ahead with reforms to its domestic taxes including provisions that could unilaterally increase the tax load of American subsidiaries of foreign companies that pay skimpy tax bills globally Meanwhile digital-services taxes could spread like wildfirepotentially incurring American tariffs in retaliation On May 10th the United States Trade Representative held a fourth day of hearings on retaliating against foreign digital-services taxes Overhaul or not tax bills will rise A version of this article was published online on May 10th 2021
 May 13th 2021,Consumer-price inflation in America jumps up to 42%,AS AMERICA’S ECONOMY bounces back from the pandemic aided by trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus the main question on investors’ minds is if and when inflation will take off The Federal Reserve has vowed to tolerate a period of above-target price rises so that the economy can get back on its feet; Jerome Powell its chairman has said it is “not even thinking about thinking” about raising interest rates Yet with many asset prices underpinned by rock-bottom rates investors have been jumpy fretting that high inflation could force the central bank handListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThen came a big inflation surprise Figures published on May 12th showed that America consumer-price index rose by 42% year-on-year in April a rate not seen since 2008 and considerably higher than the 36% that had been expected by forecasters The S&P 500 America main stockmarket index fell by 2% that dayBy far the biggest factor behind the acceleration relates to the past rather than the price pressures of today as last year oil-price falls depressed the base used to calculate the annual rate Yet even the monthly increase stripped of more volatile food and energy prices was 09% the strongest since the 1980s Data for a single month cannot tell you whether runaway inflation is around the corner But the release says something about the realities of economic reopeningConsumer demand in the world largest economy is roaring back Stimulus cheques worth up to $1400 were doled out to many Americans earlier in the year Now a successful vaccination campaign is allowing them to get out and spend and restrictions to loosen According to a tracker compiled by JPMorgan Chase a bank credit-card spending rose from a tenth below its pre-pandemic trend in the six months to March to only just below it by MayThe speed and nature of the post-lockdown bounceback seems to have caught many firms off guard Not since the mid-1970s have companies been so likely to report delays in supplier deliveries according to research published in March by Goldman Sachs a bank American retailers’ inventories relative to revenues have plunged to all-time lows suggesting that shops are running out of things to sell Many firms especially smaller ones had ordered insufficient supplies and are now frantically catching up By contrast the inventories of large listed firms have not declined either because they were better able to forecast the coming spending binge or because their supply chains are more diversifiedYet surges in demand cannot immediately be fulfilled Take imported supplies for instance Even at the best of times extra demand for international deliveries takes a while to sate; a ship can take a few weeks to sail from China to America The added complication in 2021 is that firms must also contend with shortages of containers in some ports Some were stuck in the wrong place during the first wave of lockdownsMoreover workers cannot be hired overnight Firms are struggling to recruit enough staff to fill open positionsperhaps a big reason why the jobs report for April published on May 7th showed that America had added just 266000 jobs well below the 1m or so that many economists had expected The number of unfilled positions is running at an all-time highTake the surge in demand and strained supply together and you get to higher prices Used cars and trucks are a good example Their prices rose by a staggering 10% in April contributing to the headline-inflation surprise With people nervous of flying and public transport more may want to get behind the wheel instead to see relatives in other parts of the country or to get to work But a global shortage of computer chips has also constrained the supply of new vehiclesAssured of sustained demand other companies may also begin to pass on higher costs to customers The cost of shipping items from China to America is now three times as expensive as it was before the pandemic and input prices have picked up in the springWhat if anything can these pressures tell you about inflation to come? In order for it to stay high such price rises will need to keep repeating pushing up wages in turn But the present phase could reasonably be regarded as temporary as suppliers adjust to shifting consumer tastes Even as economies locked down in 2020 for instance firms quickly found new ways to source material and bottlenecks eased The current spike would then prove transitoryYet as the recovery proceeds other surprises will come The combination of a generous Treasury a tolerant Fed and a reopening economy puts America in uncharted territory Brace yourself for more inflation scares in the coming months A version of this article was published online on May 12th 2021
 May 11th 2021,America economy suffers bottlenecks and shortages,AMERICANS ARE used to getting what they want when they want it But these days they find themselves in the unfamiliar position of having to wait Companies from General Motors to Nintendo complain of a shortage of microchips Prices of lumber and chicken breasts both in short supply are soaring; and it is ever more difficult to get hold of a pair of roller skates or a hot tub Even workers seem to be hard to come by Firms are struggling to recruit enough staff to fill open positionsperhaps a big reason why the jobs report for April published on May 7th showed that America had added just 266000 jobs well below the 1m or so that many economists had expectedThe scarcities seem to go beyond the realm of anecdotes Not since the mid-1970s have companies been so likely to report delays in supplier deliveries suggests research published in March by Goldman Sachs a bank A survey of bosses by IHS Markit indicates that manufacturers’ backlogs of work rose at a record rate in the spring That raises the question of whether shortages stand to derail the economic recoveryand set off rampant inflationThe shortages are in fact a sign of returning economic vitality Some delays were apparent in early 2020 too Then the spread of covid-19 was largely limited to China; the closure of factories there to stop its spread meant that American carmakers struggled to source key inputs But whereas those shortages were linked to the global economy shutting down today are linked to its opening up Delays seem to be most prevalent in America where it is probably no coincidence that consumer demand is making a healthy recovery According to a tracker compiled by JPMorgan Chase a bank credit-card spending rose from a tenth below its pre-pandemic trend in the six months to March to only just below it by MayThe speed of this bounce-back seems to have caught companies off guard American retailers’ inventories relative to revenues have plunged to all-time lows suggesting that shops are running out of things to sell Many firms especially smaller ones have ordered insufficient supplies and are now frantically catching up By contrast the inventories of large listed firms have not declined either because they were better able to forecast the coming spending binge or because their supply chains are more diversifiedBut surges in demand cannot immediately be fulfilled Take imported supplies for instance Even at the best of times extra demand for international deliveries takes a while to sate; a ship can take a few weeks to sail from China to America The added complication in 2021 is that firms must also contend with shortages of containers in some ports Some were stranded in the wrong place during the first wave of lockdownsIn the meantime prices of some things might well go up The cost of shipping items from China to America has roughly tripled over the past year Some firms are looking for other ways of getting products into America including air freight which will cut delivery times but cost more Monthly rates of input or producer-price inflation have picked up in the spring Once assured of demand some companies may begin to pass on higher costsOthers are rationing demand by raising prices Research by Robin Brooks of the Institute of International Finance a bankers’ association finds that American manufacturers have been raising their prices relative to their input costs by more than firms in practically any other countryAll this is contributing to market jitters that runaway inflation might be around the corner The five-year break-even rate a measure of market inflation expectations reached 27% on May 11th its highest level in 13 years Whether price rises will be sustained is far from clear Figures released on May 12th showed that the consumer-price index rose by 42% year-on-year in April a big acceleration from the previous month's figure of 26% and considerably more than many analysts had expected But by far the biggest factor in that rise relates to last year oil-price falls dropping out of the annual comparison not bottlenecksAnd last year experience suggests that shortages may not last long enough to cause more than a transient spike in inflation Even as economies locked down in early 2020 firms quickly found new ways of sourcing material The wait for a hot tub should eventually come to an end

 May 6th 2021,A new age of suburbanisation could be dawning,THOUGH THE pandemic has not fully released its grip on America signs of an incipient boom are everywhere: in surging demand for workers imports and above all houses Residential property prices rose at an annual rate of 12% in Februarythe fastest pace since 2006buoyed by rising incomes low interest rates and the belated plunge into housing markets by a crisis-battered generation of millennials A clear preference for large but affordable suburban homes over pricey city-centre flats seems to be emerging That covid-weary Americans might be eager for suburban life is hardly surprising Yet the latest pursuit of leafiness and expansive floor plans contains hints of a potentially transformative shift in how Americans choose where they liveListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKPeople housing decisions incorporate much more than mere economic concerns Yet the geographical distribution of households reflects some rough balancing of the costs and benefits of living in one place rather than another Other things equal people flock to areas that provide access to good jobs or desirable amenities like pleasant weather or a lively arts scene Movement towards attractive places is ultimately checked however by the associated costscongestion say and the price of housingwhich rise until there is no longer much to be gained from relocatingFrom time to time however economic shifts disrupt the prevailing equilibrium and trigger large-scale movement In the mid-20th century cars and highways enabled people to obtain more for their money by moving into suburbs while still maintaining access to city-centre jobs and amenities Explosive suburbanisation followed In 1940 about half of Americans lived in metropolitan rather than rural areas and most metropolitan residentsabout one-third of the total populationresided in city centres rather than suburbs By 2000 in contrast 80% of all Americans lived in metropolitan areas but the vast majorityaccounting for half the total populationlived in the suburbsIn the past two decades shifts in demand have given rise to a new equilibrium Rising incomes in knowledge-economy industries attracted workers to a few highly productive places like New York and the Bay Area and increases in congestion and commuting costs encouraged many to live near work Housing costs in high-wage cities rocketed propelled by restrictive zoning policies that prevented housebuilding from keeping up with demand Highly paid elites were concentrated in pockets of wealth while many other Americans settled in places offering jobs of middling productivity and pay but where housing was more affordableThough it is early days yet covid-19 may have disrupted this pattern Before the pandemic about 5% of full-time-work days in America came from people working at home That figure rose above 60% last spring; though it has since fallen back it remains well above pre-pandemic levels Broad adoption of remote work stands to drastically alter households’ locational calculations Recent research by Jan Brueckner of the University of California Irvine and Gary Lin and Matthew Kahn of Johns Hopkins University considers two ways in which a transformation might unfold People with high-productivity jobs could work remotely from anywhere potentially severing the link between a local economy productivity and the demand to live there and thus enabling a large-scale migration from high-cost cities to low-cost ones And remote work could allow workers to spend more time at home while still occasionally commuting into the office In that case remote work would reduce the cost of a given commute and might thus lead metropolitan areas to become more sprawlingIn fact both appear to be occurring In 2020 price gradients flattened between metropolitan areas as house prices in low-cost cities rose faster than those in high-cost cities and also within them as prices in low-cost suburban counties rose faster than those in high-cost urban ones Another recent paper by Arpit Gupta and Jonas Peeters of New York University and Vrinda Mittal and Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh of Columbia University arrives at a similar conclusion In the year to December 2020 and across America 30 largest metropolitan areas house prices rose faster the farther one moved from urban hubs Prices of properties 50km from a city centre grew by 57% more than those in centresWhether these trends continue depends on the extent to which remote-working habits stick But even a modest persistent change would have large knock-on effects One recent estimate by Jose Maria Barrero of the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago suggests that the share of hours worked remotely is likely to stabilise at about 20% In that case dense city centres could face a cycle of straitened circumstances like that which accompanied car-driven suburbanisation as local spending and tax revenues decline leading to cutbacks in amenities Spending within city centres could drop permanently by 5-10%Sometimes I wonder if the world so smallA new equilibrium might also yield striking macroeconomic benefits however Slow growth in housing supply in high-productivity cities has weighed on the economy by rationing access to high-wage jobs Had building rules in New York and the Bay Area been no stricter over the last third of the 20th century than those of the typical American city then the growth rate of national output would have been a third higher according to one estimate Remote work stands to relax this constraint on growth by allowing workers to take high-wage jobs without having to buy costly homes within easy commuting distanceThe geographically disruptive potential of information technology has long been apparent In a book published in 1997 Frances Cairncross formerly of this newspaper imagined that it might yield a “death of distance” It may have taken the public-health imperative to stay away from others to help realise it at last 
 May 6th 2021,Could sending criminals to prison be good for their kids?,IN A FORTHCOMING paper in the American Economic Review one of the discipline most prestigious journals three economists conclude that “[p]arental incarceration has beneficial effects on some important outcomes for children” Unsurprisingly the study has provoked outrage from keyboard warriors Some are uncomfortable with the very notion that prison could have anything other than wholly malign effects Others worry that the research however well intentioned gives politicians ammunition to double down on punitive penal policy In reality though the study has some uncomfortable findings it should help governments devise better policyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe authors analyse 30 years’ worth of high-quality administrative data from the state of Ohio They study children whose parents are defendants in a criminal case Using a clever methodology they in effect divide the children into two groups which are identical except in one crucial respect: whether or not one of their parents was sent to prison In some cases parents who committed relatively minor crimes were on the wrong side of harsh judges whereas others got off scot-free for the same offenceThe paper reports a number of outcomes not all of which are improved by a parental stay in prison The “estimates on academic performance and teen parenthood are imprecise” the authors say But a parent incarceration lowers the chance of their child going to prison from 124% to 75% It also appears to cause the children to go on to live in better-off neighbourhoods which could be a sign that household earnings rise Perhaps having a parent go to prison scares a child straight; or perhaps removing a bad influence from a family allows those left behind to thriveDoes this mean that America would benefit from even tougher penal policy? Hardly The paper findings suggest that the overall costs of the prison system including the money spent on housing inmates are likely to outweigh the benefits The true messages of the paper are subtler Any effort to reduce America sky-high incarceration rate though noble would need to reckon with the costs that it might impose on some children It is a sorry state of affairs that American kids could stand to gain when their parents are locked up The challenge for economists and politicians is to find policies to help them that are not as socially destructiveA version of this article was published online on May 5th 2021

that it will allow the state to wield far more control over money; and that it will challenge the dollar for prominenceWithin China however many economists are far less bullish The design of the eCNY and the nature of China economic system mean that each of these claims is unlikely to be realised soon “The digital yuan is not magic so we don’t expect magic from it” says Gary Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute in ShanghaiStart with the first claim that digitisation offers unmatched surveillance abilities letting the state track all spending It is not entirely wrong But it is a limited gain compared with its existing powersMost mobile payments today involve a bank card tethered to users’ accounts on Alipay or WeChat These must pass through NetsUnion a central clearing platform Similarly foreign-exchange transactions take place on the China Foreign Exchange Trade System In both cases regulators can see how people spend in real time For mobile payments that do not touch banks officials can demand a record and says an industry insider may soon require real-time reporting tooThe upshot is that even without eCNY regulators have no real blind spots left apart from old-fashioned cash And so long as millions of older citizens do not much like paying for things with smartphones the government will not phase out cashThe second bold claim about eCNY is that it will reshape monetary policy in China According to this view the central bank will be able to program money to be used for specific purposes and at predefined times This however both understates what the central bank can already do and overstates what the eCNY will let it doChina already manages both the money supply and interest rates with different sectors in mind Since 2015 for instance it has created hundreds of billions of yuan for the construction of affordable housing More recently it has instructed banks to lower interest rates for small firmsThe eCNY one might assume will make targeting more precise But its design will circumscribe its role The central bank will replace only a small portion of base money known as M0 with eCNY leaving the rest of the money supply undisturbed see chart 2 It will distribute eCNY through commercial banks which in turn will make it available to the public It will not pay interest on eCNY And it will probably place low ceilings on how much people can holdGranted the central bank may in time expand the eCNY role But the limitations exist for a reason The government is wary of undermining the financial system It does not want savers to switch out of bank deposits en masse into eCNY which would make it harder for banks to fund themselves Moreover few serious economists in Beijing like the idea of a 100% eCNY money supply in which the government could directly control how banks lend “We don’t want to go back to central planning That would be a mistake” says Yu Yongding a former adviser to the central bankThe final bold claim is that eCNY will catapult the yuan to global status But that misunderstands why it accounts for just 2% of international payments today about the same as the Canadian dollar When deciding which currencies to use companies and investors consider how easily they can make conversions to other currencies; how freely they can invest them; and whether they trust the issuing countries’ legal systems China insistence on maintaining far tighter capital controls than any other major economy as well as deep-seated doubts about its political system blunt the yuan appeal The limiting factors are policy and politics not technologyEven the technological case for eCNY is far from clear-cut When companies transfer money in and out of China they already use currency in a digital format: electronic messages on the SWIFT payments network instruct banks to credit accounts in one country and debit them in another What slows things down is complying with China capital controls and with international regulations such as those aimed at stopping money-launderingThe eCNY will not eliminate such checks and the Belgium-headquartered SWIFT system which connects more than 11000 financial institutions is likely to remain the most efficient conduit for sharing payment information across borders “Even in the long term SWIFT will remain indispensable” says Liu Dongmin of the Chinese Academy of Social SciencesThe three more radical claims about it may not be realised but will the eCNY fulfil the original aim of giving the central bank a foothold in the digital-payments universe? Probably but not a giant one After the eCNY trial in Shenzhen Ms Lu said that she would use it for some payments but that Alipay and WeChat were far more convenient because of how they tie into commercial and social-messaging networks Mr Liu of the China Financial Reform Institute expects others to concur He predicts that in three years the eCNY will account for less than 5% of mobile paymentsWestern governments and central bankers mulling digital currencies of their own may wonder if the outcome of the eCNY experiment will contain any lessons for them But China is unusual in so many waysfrom its sheltered financial system and intricate capital controls to the size of its mobile paymentsthat its experience could well prove to be unique And other countries are sure to implement different designs for their digital currencies Still China caution with the eCNY if nothing else hints at how disruptive the technology if unconstrained could be Correction May 9th 2021: The scale on chart 2 has been corrected to yuan trillions  Dig deeperThe digital currencies that matter May 2021Special report: The future of banking May 2021A version of this article was published online on May 3rd 2021

 Apr 29th 2021,Why private-credit markets are due a growth spurt,THERE ARE many ways to tell the story of the turnaround in America capital markets since last spring The focus has been on public markets notably the wondrous surge in share prices Yet the change in fortunes of private equity PE is perhaps more remarkable A year ago Blackstone a PE giant reported a first-quarter loss of more than $1bn A reckoning seemed overdue Widespread defaults on overborrowed PE-owned businesses were expected A year on Blackstone has reported record profits of $175bn So much for comeuppanceListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIts rude health owes a lot to the speed as much as the extent of recovery in asset prices Buyout shops barely had time to mark down their portfolio companies in line with a falling stockmarket before share prices suddenly recovered Dealmaking has picked up to a frantic pace Competition from corporate buyers means that buyout firms must move quickly Where they have an edge is in raising debt In fact the premium on speed in PE is why you should expect to see a sharp pickup in a related corner of capital marketsprivate creditPrivate credit mainly serves mid-sized companies that are acquiring something or undergoing change of some kindbuying out a family member stake; refinancing their bank debts; and so on More often than not this change will be carried out under the auspices of a PE sponsor and require a lot of borrowing Banks used to finance this sort of thing but not anymore To access the public markets a company must meet the demands of regulators It must be biggish and profitable with a history of pristine financial statements A lot of companies do not tick the boxesPrivate credit has elements of both bank and capital-market finance It is like a bank loan in that it is tailored to the borrower and does not usually change hands in markets It is like a publicly traded bond in that the end-investors are pension and insurance funds looking for regular fixed income The border between private and public credit is blurry The defining factor is how widely a loan is distributed The highest-profile part of private credit is the market for leveraged loans which are fixed-income instruments sold to syndicates of investors The more widely a loan is distributed the more liquid it is A broadly syndicated loan might be sold to 100 or more lenders By contrast the number of parties to a truly private deal is often in the single digitsThe bigger PE firms have private-credit arms The set of skills required is similar says Mike Arougheti of Ares a private-asset manager Both types of investor need to make sound judgments about the growth of cashflows and the hazards around it for companies that are not widely researched There are obvious synergies Say a PE firm has carried out due diligence on a buyout target only to lose out to a bid from a rival Having done the homework the losing firm might call up the winner and offer to buy the debtThis nexus with PE is one reason to expect a spurt in private credit For PE sponsors the attraction of private credit is speed There are no lengthy discussions with regulators rating agencies or underwriting banks And speed matters more than ever Buyout funds have $1trn or more of “dry powder” capital that has been raised but not yet deployed “Equity markets have rallied so corporate buyers are competitive” say Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus of Crescent Capital a private-credit firm The upshot is that every potential target has many biddersThe other reason to expect growth in private credit is its appeal to investors Yields are higher than on widely traded corporate bonds Moreover the interest charged on private loans is usually tied to short-term interest rates That protects investors from sudden changes in Federal Reserve policy which fixed-rate corporate bonds are vulnerable to Private-credit specialists typically demand greater control over the terms of lending That way they can mitigate the risks of a borrower getting into trouble They are also better placed to recover more of their money in the event of a default In a lightly syndicated deal there are fewer people to indulge in wasteful squabbling over the remainsEverything is happening more quickly in capital markets Even though private markets do not trade minute-by-minute there is little time to lose It seems only yesterday that regulators were fretting publicly about the unchecked growth of opaque private-credit markets Things then went quietBut the noise levels may go up again soon
 Apr 29th 2021,What an infrastructure bonanza could mean for America economy,JOE BIDEN’S plan to lavish spending on infrastructure is a crucial part of his bid for a transformative presidency Much of the first tranche of around $27trn now entering the meatgrinder of congressional politics will be spent on greening the American economy and tackling inequalities About a quarter will be directed towards overhauling transport water and other basic infrastructurea vast sum by recent standards Bridges to nowhere and white elephants are not the stuff of which proud legacies are made and history view of the bill will depend on its specifics which are still to be determined Yet economic research suggests that in the right circumstances basic infrastructure spending has significant positive effects in the long runListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA clear understanding of infrastructure contribution to growth has been a long time coming In 1944 Leland Jenks an economic historian extolled America railways as a transformative force noting that “the conviction that the railroad would run anywhere at a profit put fresh spurs to American ingenuity and opened closed paddocks of potential enterprise” Yet Robert Fogel a Nobel-prizewinning economist argued in 1964 that the “social savings” generated by railwaysthe contribution to economic growth relative to alternatives like canalswas in fact rather modest: worth perhaps at most 3% of annual output in 1890Economists’ attempts to grapple with the effects of infrastructure spending intensified around 1990 David Aschauer then of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago argued that the size of the public capital stock contributed substantially to productivity and that the end of America post-war infrastructure-spending spree was an important cause of the slowdown in productivity growth in the 1970s Assessing this claim was not easy Untangling causation presented problems for instance: does infrastructure investment cause fast growth do fast-growing economies demand lots of investment or are both things caused by some other factor?Subsequent research suggested that infrastructure spending does indeed lift growth in output and productivity John Fernald of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco tackled the causation issue by studying whether new spending on roads subsequently raised productivity in industries that use roads intensively relative to others that do not His analysis determined that post-war road-building was both a good investment and a boon to growth; it contributed about one percentage point more to productivity growth across the economy before 1973 than it did thereafter More recent work by Valerie Ramey of the University of California San Diego arrives at a similar conclusion She estimates that a 1% increase in the stock of public capital is associated with a rise in output of 033%: a figure slightly below but very close to past estimates including AschauerWhat impact then would an infrastructure bonanza have if it makes it through Congress? As both Mr Fernald and Ms Ramey note the value of new investment depends upon the state of the infrastructure already in place The second high-speed transport link between two cities is unlikely to have the same positive economic impact as the first How much America stands to benefit from new spending will depend in part on its needsA burst of investment does seem overdue While spending on most sorts of infrastructure adjusted for inflation has continued to climb in recent decades net investmenttaking account of depreciation of an ageing capital stockhas not Growth in the real net stock of transport capital per person which rose above 2% in the 1960s subsequently dropped below 1%; in the aftermath of the financial crisis it sank to nearly zero Spending on most other sorts of infrastructure has followed similar trends with the exception of digital capital Mr Biden proposal also allocates large sums to measures intended to reduce and protect against climate change like electric-vehicle infrastructure and retrofitting homes and buildings which could raise output in the future by reducing the economic cost of climate changeMoney alone will not solve all problems though: infrastructure spending does not for instance reduce congestion Studies consistently show that new transport capacity does not reduce gridlock over the long run because free-flowing traffic attracts new users until roads and railways fill up once more Breaking up jams economists reckon requires charging users for access to transport capacity through tolls or other fees Such a policy could both raise money and improve the efficiency with which transport is used but it has proved politically difficult to implementRoadway JoeYet new transport investments could subtly reshape America economic geography Past spending has had profound effects on the location of activity America interstate highways drove the country socially transformative suburbanisation for example Work by Nathaniel Baum-Snow of the University of Toronto concludes that but for the construction of the interstate highway system the populations of American cities would have grown by 8% between 1950 and 1990; instead they shrank by 17% A reassessment of Fogel estimates of the impact of railways by Richard Hornbeck of the University of Chicago and Martin Rotemberg of New York University which considers their wider impact on the economy suggests that without the railways America GDP in 1890 would have been around a quarter smaller The massive shift in population they brought about altered not only the American economy but the very idea of what America was and could beA new era of large-scale infrastructure investment would necessarily be less revolutionary than the railways and roads of the past Yet it might nonetheless prove surprisingly transformative in its direct economic impact its knock-on effects on private industryand in the psychological spur it provides to a country that could do with a bit of reinvigoration and renewal

 Apr 29th 2021,What history tells you about post-pandemic booms,THE CHOLERA pandemic of the early 1830s hit France hard It wiped out nearly 3% of Parisians in a month and hospitals were overwhelmed by patients whose ailments doctors could not explain The end of the plague prompted an economic revival with France following Britain into an industrial revolution But as anyone who has read “Les Misérables” knows the pandemic also contributed to another sort of revolution The city poor hit hardest by the disease fulminated against the rich who had fled to their country homes to avoid contagion France saw political instability for years afterwardsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKToday even as covid-19 rages across poorer countries the rich world is on the verge of a post-pandemic boom Governments are lifting stay-at-home orders as vaccinations reduce hospitalisations and deaths from the virus Many forecasters reckon that America economy will grow by more than 6% this year at least four percentage points faster than its pre-pandemic trend Other countries are also in for unusually fast growth see chart 1 The Economist analysis of GDP data for the G7 economies going back to 1820 suggests that such a synchronised acceleration relative to trend is rare It has not happened since the post-war boom of the 1950sThe situation is so unfamiliar that economists are turning to history for a sense of what to expect The record suggests that after periods of massive non-financial disruption such as wars and pandemics GDP does bounce back It offers three further lessons First while people are keen to go out and spend uncertainty lingers Second crises encourage people and businesses to try new ways of doing things upending the structure of the economy Third as “Les Misérables” shows political upheaval often follows with unpredictable economic consequencesTake consumer spending first Evidence from earlier pandemics suggests that during the acute phase people behave as they have during the past year of covid-19 accumulating savings as spending opportunities vanish In the first half of the 1870s during an outbreak of smallpox Britain household-saving rate doubled Japan saving rate more than doubled during the first world war In 1919-20 as the Spanish flu raged Americans stashed away more cash than in any subsequent year until the second world war When that war hit savings rose again with households accumulating additional balances in 1941-45 worth some 40% of GDPHistory also offers a guide to what people do once life gets back to normal Spending rises prompting employment to recover but there is not much evidence of excess The notion that people celebrated the end of the Black Death by “wild fornication” and “hysterical gaiety” as some historians suppose is probably apocryphal The 1920s were far from roaring at least at first On New Year Eve 1920 after the threat of Spanish flu had decisively passed “Broadway and Times Square looked more like the old days” according to one study but America nonetheless felt like “a sick and tired nation” A recent paper by Goldman Sachs a bank estimates that in 1946-49 American consumers spent only about 20% of their excess savings That extra spending certainly aided the post-war boom though the government monthly “business situation” reports in the late 1940s were nonetheless filled with worry of an impending slowdown and indeed the economy went into recession in 1948-49 Beer consumption actually fell Consumers’ caution may be one reason why there is little evidence of pandemic-induced surges in inflation see chart 2The second big lesson from post-pandemic booms relates to the “supply side” of the economyhow and where goods and services are produced Though in aggregate people appear to be less keen on frivolity following a pandemic some may be more willing to try new ways of making money Historians believe the Black Death made Europeans more adventurous Piling on to a ship and setting sail for new lands seemed less risky when so many people were dying at home “Apollo Arrow” a recent book by Nicholas Christakis of Yale University shows that the Spanish flu pandemic gave way to “increased expressions of risk-taking” Indeed a study for America National Bureau of Economic Research published in 1948 found that the number of startups boomed from 1919 Today new business formation is once again surging across the rich world as entrepreneurs seek to fill gaps in the marketOther economists have drawn a link between pandemics and another change to the supply side of the economy: the use of labour-saving technology Bosses may want to limit the spread of disease and robots do not fall ill A paper by researchers at the IMF looks at a number of recent outbreaks of diseases including Ebola and SARS and finds that “pandemic events accelerate robot adoption especially when the health impact is severe and is associated with a significant economic downturn” The 1920s were also an era of rapid automation in America especially in telephone operation one of the most common jobs for young American women in the early 1900s Others have drawn a link between the Black Death and Johannes Gutenberg printing press There is as yet little hard evidence of a surge in automation because of covid-19 though anecdotes aboundWhether automation deprives people of jobs however is another matter Some research suggests that workers in fact do better in the aftermath of pandemics A paper published last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco finds that real wages tend to rise In some cases this is through a macabre mechanism: the disease culls workers leaving survivors in a stronger bargaining positionIn other cases however rising wages are the product of political changesthe third big lesson of historical booms When people have suffered in large numbers attitudes may shift towards workers That seems to be happening this time: policymakers across the world are less interested in reducing public debt or warding off inflation than they are in getting unemployment down A new paper from three academics at the London School of Economics also finds that covid-19 has made people across Europe more averse to inequalitySuch pressures have in some instances exploded into political disorder Pandemics expose and accentuate pre-existing inequalities leading those on the wrong side of the bargain to look for redress Ebola in 2013-16 increased civil violence in West Africa by 40% according to one study Recent research from the IMF considers the effect of five pandemics including Ebola SARS and Zika in 133 countries since 2001 It finds that they led to a significant increase in social unrest “It is reasonable to expect that as the pandemic fades unrest may re-emerge in locations where it previously existed” researchers write in another IMF paper Social unrest seems to peak two years after the pandemic ends Enjoy the coming boom while it lasts Before long there

 Apr 29th 2021,Will Joe Biden proposed taxes on capital make America an outlier?,IF PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN succeeds in raising America top rate of federal capital-gains and dividend tax to 396% as he pledged to Congress on April 28th it would be twice the average top rate in Europe But it would apply only to the highest-earning 03% of taxpayers: those earning more than $1m The fact that countries cast their nets differently makes comparing taxes on capital which include levies on companies and property as well as on capital gains and dividends tricky The OECD a club of mostly rich countries does not publicly track members’ capital-gains-tax rates because exemptions and carve-outs make them so hard to compareListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFortunately comparing how much money countries raise is easier America total taxes on capital brought in revenues worth about 5% of GDP in 2018 according to analysis by Spencer Bastani of the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy and Daniel Waldenstrom of the Research Institute of Industrial Economics two Swedish think-tanks That compares with an average of 58% for a panel of 16 OECD countries What is distinctive about America is its mix of capital taxes Its corporate tax raises relatively meagre revenues see chart whereas property-tax revenues are unusually high Overall America collects less tax than most rich countries so as a share of total revenues capital taxes are a hefty 20% fifth among the 16 countries in the researchers’ sampleBy how much would Mr Biden plans change this picture? Working out the answer is just as tricky as conducting cross-country comparisons The headline proposals are straightforward Corporate taxes would rise from 21% to 28% And the rate on capital gains and dividends would nearly double from 20% for top earners who own a disproportionate share of wealth But assessing how saving and investment respond to capital taxes is one of the most hotly debated topics in economicsInvestors can choose when to sell assets and therefore when to pay capital-gains tax American budget wonks usually calculate a revenue-maximising rate of capital-gains tax of about 28% But that is under existing rules which in effect waive the tax on estates when heirs inherit them Mr Biden wants to close that loophole so postponing capital gains indefinitely might no longer be so attractive drawing more of them into the tax net Taking this change into account the Penn-Wharton budget model finds that Mr Biden capital-gains proposal would raise $113bn over ten years That is still relatively modest compared with the $1trn that Mr Biden proposed increase to the corporate tax is expected to bring in The combined revenues would come to about 04% of projected GDP over the decade which would still leave America in the middle of the OECD pack for overall capital taxesMight the scorekeepers be underestimating the revenues from changing capital-gains taxes? That is what a recent paper by Natasha Sarin of the University of Pennsylvania Larry Summers of Harvard University Owen Zidar of Princeton University and Eric Zwick of the University of Chicago argues for a variety of technical reasons Earlier work by Mr Zidar and Ole Agersnap also of Princeton finds a rate of 38-47% could maximise revenue Still the uncertainty around these analyses is highthe second paper relies on an extrapolation from state-level taxes And in any case the revenue-maximising rate is not necessarily the same as the most desirable rate for society notes James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyEconomic policy should consider both the revenue raised and the downsides of the taxand Congress will no doubt soon be debating just that A version of this article was published online on April 28th 2021
 Apr 29th 2021,Why are American workers becoming harder to find?,THE PANDEMIC has led to all sorts of weird economic outcomes The latest oddity is the growing chorus of complaints in America about a shortage of labour even though 8m fewer people are in work today than before covid-19 struck In early April Bloomberg reported that Delta Air Lines had cancelled 100 flights for lack of staff People are so hard to find that one café in Florida has turned to robots to greet customers and deliver food A branch of McDonald is paying potential burger-flippers $50 just to turn up for a job interviewListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe data back up the anecdotes Total vacancies are running at their highest level for at least two decades see chart indicating that firms have plenty of unfilled positions Furthermore job openings are leading to fewer hires than you would expect based on the historical relationship between the two And even accounting for changes in the composition of the workforce wage growth at about 3% has been surprisingly robust suggesting that firms are offering bigger pay packets to tempt workers If they persist job shortages could eventually fuel inflation threatening the economic recoveryThere are three potential explanations for the puzzling shortages: over-generous benefits; fearful workers; and a reallocation of labour between industries Start with America huge fiscal handouts The latest stimulus cheques posted in the spring were for up to $1400 per person Seemingly every American knows of a neighbour cousin boyfriend who received a “stimmy” cheque then quit his job in order to sit on the sofa A federal supplement to unemployment insurance UI currently $300 a week ensures that four in ten unemployed people earn more from benefits than they did in their previous job Economic research has long concluded that more generous benefits blunt incentives to look for workYet this relationship appears to have weakened during the pandemic The fact that increases in UI payments have been time-limited may make workers reluctant to turn down a job with longer-lasting rewards In the early part of the pandemic the UI supplement was even more generous at $600 but its expiry in the summer had “little effect on overall employment” according to a paper published in February by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst Likewise in the areas where the current $300 is a relatively larger boost to income employment growth has not weakened since January when that uplift was introducedThis suggests that the second factor fear may be important in explaining America shortage of staff Nearly 4m people are not looking for work “because of the coronavirus pandemic” according to official data And consider which industries are experiencing the most acute worker shortages Jobs in health care recreation and hospitality report the highest level of job openings relative to employment Many of these involve plenty of person-to-person contact making their workers especially vulnerable to infection a study from California earlier this year found that cooks were most at risk from dying of covid-19 By contrast in industries where maintaining social distancing or being outside is often easier labour shortages are less of an issue The number of job openings per employee in the construction industry is lower today than it was before the pandemicThe final reason for worker shortages relates to the extraordinary reallocation of resources under way in the economy The headline growth in vacancies represents the rise in opportunities in some industriessay clerks in DIY storesas others decline reflecting changing consumer demands Analysis by The Economist of over 400 local areas also finds a wide variation in job churn across geographies: the gap between jobs growth in the most buoyant areas and that in struggling ones is twice as wide as it was before the pandemic Workers may take time to catch up with this creative destruction A former bartender looking for work in downtown Manhattan for instance may not quickly spot and secure a position as a delivery driver in farther-out WestchesterAs vaccinations continue to reduce hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19 and limit the spread of the disease Americans’ fears about taking high-contact jobs should fade too But if shortages are to dissipate fully and the threat of inflation is to be contained some of the unemployed will also have to take up work in sectors and areas that are new to them A version of this article was published online on April 27th 2021
 Apr 24th 2021,Has Europe BlackRock outgrown its pond?,THE PRACTICE of elevating a company chief executive to chairman has come to be frowned upon if only because a new boss often struggles to break free if her predecessor is looking over her shoulder Not so at Amundi Europe biggest money manager In May Yves Perrier its CEO since 2010 will move upstairs and Valérie Baudson his current deputy takes the helm as chief executive Shareholders have reacted to the news rather well: Amundi share price has risen by 11% since it was announced in FebruaryListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat shows how much they value continuity at the firm Under Mr Perrier Amundi assets under management and net income more than doubled to €17trn $21trn and €962m by the end of 2020 Its market capitalisation has swollen from €75bn in 2015 when it went public to around €15bn The firm is still a cut below America titans: BlackRock for instance manages about $9trn in assets Yet Amundi is nearly twice as big as its closest continental rival and the only European firm in the global top ten The question for Ms Baudson is whether the firm has much more room to growThree factors have underpinned Amundi rise since it came into being in 2010 a result of the merger of the asset-management arms of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale two French banks One is the €650bn in assets it took over from its parents which gave it the scale to spread out costs and pocket recurrent income Cleverly it signed quasi-exclusive distribution contracts with the banks ensuring its role as the main manufacturer of investment products for their institutional clients and that revenue would remain stableAmundi then used its excess cash to acquire rivals including the asset-management arms of UniCredit an Italian bank in 2016 and of Banco Sabadell a Spanish lender in 2020 Whereas the portfolios it inherited gave it a foothold in retail investment where margins are higher these deals allowed it to expand its distribution network further Amundi made integrating those units smoother by developing its own data- and portfolio-management platform rather than relying on suppliersits third smart choice and one that BlackRock has made too That has curbed operating costs: at 51% of income they are among the lowest in EuropeMs Baudson can expect a benign few months Unable to spend much during lockdowns households have stashed record amounts at banks some of which should flow to money managers Yet beyond the short-term bump being “the biggest most efficient manufacturing machine” may not suffice says Haley Tam of Credit Suisse a bank Unlike BlackRock Amundi cannot tap a vast domestic market and its routes to growth are narrowingSome woes are common across the industry Margins are being crushed The shift to low-cost “passive” funds which track an index is accelerating in Europe and dragging managers’ average fees down Competition is fierce And lower interest rates and therefore returns are making active managers’ hefty fees more conspicuous precisely when regulators are demanding more transparent disclosure on costs and chargesOther concerns are specific to Amundi Some of the contracts that it so cleverly signed with banks will soon expire History suggests they are usually renewed but on worse terms for the manager says Mike Werner of UBS another bank And in an attempt to seek extra returns for its clients Amundi wants to grow its alternative-investment franchise But it faces stiff competition from specialists And its scale is a problem The firm is too big for this comparatively tiny business to make much of a difference to the top lineMr Perrier is unfazed by all this Amundi has room to expand he argues Over half its assets still come from France see chart The firm already has a foothold in fast-growing markets such as India where it has a joint venture with the country largest bank and China where it has a tie-up with AgBank and Bank of China two big lenders It is targeting €500bn in Asian assets by 2025 up from nearly €300bn today “The idea that in the next five to seven years China becomes as important as France is not stupid” Mr Perrier saysEven in Europe organic growth is possible The shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution pension schemes which give savers more discretion over how they invest should boost retail investment says Tom Mills of Jefferies an investment bank The huge interest in environmental social and governance products also helps: last year these accounted for around 70% of Amundi net inflowsAmundi also has about €12bn of excess capital available for acquisitions The firm is in talks to buy Lyxor Europe third-largest provider of exchange-traded funds ETFs from Société Générale for €825m A merger would make Amundi the second-biggest provider of ETFs after BlackRockThe firm is venturing out into new activities too Last year it set up a division to license its suite of software to smaller managers putting it in competition with BlackRock analysts expect Amundi to price its services more cheaply It aims to increase such sales sixfold by 2025 to €150m That would give the share price a leg up: Mr Perrier notes that such businesses are typically valued at 20-22 times earnings compared with 13-14 times for the whole groupDone well all this could sustain rapid growth It helps that Ms Baudson brings experience of the fastest-growing parts of the business notably the ETF unit which she currently runs She has relatively little experience of executing acquisitions But if she needs advice the consummate dealmaker will be just a flight of stairs away Correction April 25th 2021: A previous version of this article said Amundi net income was €962bn in 2020 It was in fact €962m 
 Apr 22nd 2021,One emerging-market worry gives way to another,DESPITE THEIR supposed dynamism emerging markets often struggle to escape their past A few months ago investors worried that this year would turn out to be a repeat of 2013 when rising bond yields in America prompted a sharp sell-off in emerging markets known as the taper tantrum Now investors are worried that 2021 will be a grim repeat of last year as another more virulent wave of covid-19 infections spreads through Brazil India and elsewhereListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTo give shape to these fears analysts have been busy drawing up lists of the most vulnerable countries based on everything from inflation to infection rates They have been looking for this year successors to the “fragile five” Brazil India Indonesia South Africa and Turkey the countries that were hardest hit by the taper tantrum eight years ago So it is notable that the man who named the original five James Lord of Morgan Stanley a bank has chosen this moment to turn “outright bullish” on some emerging-market assets telling his clients to “buy local bonds” What explains his calm in the face of calamity?The calamity is after all undeniable India second wave is terrifying but not unique The recorded number of new infections per 1m people is still higher over the past two weeks of data in Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia and Turkey than in India JPMorgan Chase another bank last week cut its growth forecasts for India and Brazil following earlier cuts for the Philippines and much of central Europe It now expects the combined GDP of emerging markets excluding China to grow by 59% this year That is barely any faster than the pace expected of developed markets which are projected to grow by 57% and would leave emerging-market GDP only 1% bigger than in 2019But even as the covid-19 wave is repeating itself the bond tantrum is not The yield on ten-year American government bonds has stopped rising and slipped back below 16% despite strong data on jobs housing manufacturing and retail sales in the world biggest boomiest economy The “real” yield on inflation-protected bonds is now -07% about the same as it was at the end of February If the American bond market remains this well behaved in the coming months then foreign investors will find it harder to resist the spicier rewards offered by bonds denominated in the rand real or rupiahIndeed one reason why the tantrum has receded is because the virus has not As the pandemic begins to interrupt the emerging world economic recovery their central banks will surely worry less about any gathering inflationary pressure Morgan Stanley believes that central banks in Brazil Russia and Mexico among others are unlikely to raise interest rates as sharply as markets now expect The delayed recovery is bad for emerging economies but not necessarily bad for their governments’ paper Bonds usually do well when growth is slow and central banks are doveish notes Mr LordHe nonetheless acknowledges two dangers to this view One is that American bond yields start climbing again sooner than he expects Another risk is that the delayed recovery in a big emerging economy turns into something worse frightening investors and raising worries about the government creditworthiness In that case the price of local bonds would fall and yields would rise even in the absence of any threat of inflation In the rich world people flock to their governments’ bonds even in the worst of times In the emerging world investors unfortunately do likewise flocking to rich countries’ assets and abandoning their own That is another way in which emerging economies remain trapped by their past 
 Apr 22nd 2021,Isaiah Andrews wins the John Bates Clark Medal,ECONOMISTS LIKE to crunch numbers and build models to guide policymakers But who guides them in turn? Isaiah Andrews of Harvard University has been trying to help On April 20th the American Economic Association awarded him the John Bates Clark Medal a prize for leading economists under the age of 40 for his effortsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Andrews did not expect to become an econometrician an economist who specialises in statistics But during graduate study he was drawn towards questions about the lessons and limits of data With Matthew Gentzkow of Stanford University and Jesse Shapiro of Brown University he suggested a way to assess the quality of economists’ models He also showed economists how to work out how much their findings might change under alternative assumptions helping them fend off accusations that their results were a feature of their assumptions rather than the dataIn work with Maximilian Kasy now of Oxford University Mr Andrews cast light on the fact that economists are too eager to pursue striking results and journal editors too prone to approve them Studies that find that minimum wages have no significant effect on employment for example are only a third as likely to be published as those finding a stronger negative effect The researchers developed a way to adjust reported results for this publication biasand found that the average effect of a higher minimum wage on employment fell by halfMr Andrews with others also explored what is called the winner curse when it comes to choosing between policies: the policy that performs best in a trial may owe its top rank to chance and will later be doomed to disappoint To illustrate this the researchers turn to a trial that assesses the most effective ways of encouraging people to donate to charity by combining requests for specific donations with promises to match the initial contribution The researchers find that if the charity chooses the method that does best in a trial it will always overestimate its donations They suggest ways to make a more realistic estimate that takes account of the role of chanceAll told the prize-giving committee concluded Mr Andrews had helped turn econometrics “back towards the study of the most important problems faced in empirical research”

 Apr 22nd 2021,How to think about vaccines and patents in a pandemic,WITH ANY luck the world will be awash in covid-19 vaccines by the end of the year For now though it is not and of the billion or so doses that have been produced the vast majority have been administered in richer countries Deaths by contrast are increasingly concentrated in poorer ones like India where only about nine in every 100 people have been jabbed compared with 64 in America Some governments are floating radical options to remedy the mismatch India and South Africa for instance propose that members of the World Trade Organisation waive intellectual-property IP protections for covid-fighting technologies including vaccines Some in the rich world are warming to the idea; in America ten Democratic senators recently urged President Joe Biden to back it Drugmakers however warn that it would deal a crippling blow to innovation Even though IP protections are not a big constraint on vaccine production today the experience of covid-19 suggests that a re-examination of IP rights in the context of health emergencies is overdueListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe economic argument for IP protections seems compelling enough Innovation is costly and risky Pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in drug development with no guarantee of success If other firms could freely copy a newly discovered treatment then its price would quickly fall to the marginal cost of production leaving the innovator unable to cover the costs of development A short-term monopoly on production granted to innovating firms is needed to make the upfront investments economically worthwhile Patents provide this protectionIP protections do not always work in quite this way however Studies routinely find little or no evidence that strengthening them boosts subsequent innovation argue Michele Boldrin and David Levine of Washington University in St Louis; pharmaceuticals where IP rights are often assumed to be essential are no exception Patents award rich profits to firms even though private investment accounts for only about a third of spending on American biomedical research they estimate Other rewards to innovation such as financial prizes could yield more breakthrough drugs at lower cost Yet for now IP protections are crucial to the businesses of most of the firms developing covid-19 vaccinesShould some of these be waived in a pandemic that continues to claim more than 10000 lives a day? Advocates argue that the pandemic is clearly an extreme event that warrants an exemption from IP laws The rapid creation and production of so many covid-19 vaccines is a testament to the long years of private investment in the associated technologies and the urgency with which experts at biotech firms moved when the pandemic began But there is no ignoring the vast public resources that made these efforts possible from support for basic research to piles of government cash Nor would a waiver endanger pharma firms’ viability Pfizer would still be highly profitable even if you excluded its expected vaccine-related profits of $4bn in 2021Yet industry interests are right to say that liberating vaccine IP would not unleash a flood of new production Most of the world vaccine-making capacity is already in use in some cases because developers signed licensing agreements with other manufacturers AstraZeneca for instance struck just such a deal with the Serum Institute of India the world largest vaccine-maker Other constraints on production have bound more tightly than IP rules including the limited availability of raw materials and expertise needed to safely produce doses Some of those have been imposed by governments themselves through export restrictions that interfere with supply chainsMoreover the biggest obstacle to expanding capacity is not IP protections but proprietary resources and other know-how which are not shielded by patents Many poorer countries face no patent barriers to using the mRNA technologies employed by Pfizer and Moderna; the obstacle is instead a lack of familiarity with new techniques Similarly would-be producers of adenovirus-type vaccines such as that developed by AstraZeneca lack access to the specially developed cell lines needed to create themA patently bad ideaThis state of affairs illustrates deficiencies in how both drugmakers and governments have handled the vaccine effort Firms have been reluctant to share cell lines data and tacit know-how with producers that could one day pose a competitive threat slowing the creation of new and life-saving production capacity In some cases trade rules permit governments to grant compulsory licencesthe right to use a patented invention without the inventor consent for a price But such licences are of no use if developers do not also share the other information and resources needed to produce doses An initiative to aid such sharing set up by the World Health Organisation for instance has been all but ignored by the industryYet the experience of the past year also suggests how governments might do better when they next negotiate contracts say for vaccines to counter new variants Having invested so much in development they neglected to include measures in contracts to compel drugmakers to share the information other manufacturers need to quickly produce vast amounts of vaccines Nor have they sought to press firms to transfer the technology needed to expand manufacturing In the meantime governments could do more to rethink the ground rules for technology transfer and the sharing of intellectual property so as to be prepared for the next pandemic Costly errors were made their toll measured in lives But they need not be repeated Dig deeperAll our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our coronavirus hub You can also listen to  The Jab our new podcast on the race between injections and infections and find trackers showing the global roll-out of vaccines excess deaths by country and the virus spread across Europe and America

was “proceed with caution” it was lost on Donald Trump who became president soon after The screw was turned against China Iran Russia Venezuela and others The steady increase in sanctions “proved to be a rare constant” on Mr Trump watch says Adam Smith of Gibson Dunn a law firm During Mr Trump four-year term the Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC which oversees American sanctions programmes targeted roughly twice as many entities and individuals a year as it had during the two-term presidencies of George W Bush and Barack Obama see chartThose who thought Joe Biden would sound a retreat were quickly set straight True his administration hoping to revive a nuclear deal with Iran struck by Mr Obama but abandoned by Mr Trump is talking to the Islamic Republic about easing his predecessor “maximum pressure” sanctions However his first few months in office have also seen a host of new sanctionsOn April 15th America announced sweeping measures against Russia for election-meddling cyber-attacks and more A month earlier America and Western allies had imposed asset freezes and travel bans on several Chinese officials for their role in human-rights abuses in Xinjiang Since Mr Biden took office America has also sanctioned officials deemed to have undermined Hong Kong autonomy; announced curbs on China access to American technology for supercomputers; and targeted companies linked to the junta behind Myanmar coupSuch measures show how sanctions have become a central tool of foreign policy Governments increasingly see them as a way to try to change other states’ behaviour in situations where diplomacy alone is insufficient but military intervention is seen as too risky or heavy-handedAs the use of sanctions has grown so has their variety What was once a smattering of trade embargoes has become a global mesh of coercive tools some covering countries or whole economic sectors others single firms or individuals Mr Trump targets included Huawei a Chinese 5G-network provider and TikTok a video app; Mr Biden sanctions cover a Russian troll farm and a Pakistan-based firm that allegedly creates fake IDs used by trollsMr Biden is likely to make use of America Magnitsky Act named after a lawyer who died in a Russian prison to move against foreign officials accused of corruption or serious human-rights abuses Western countriesincluding Britain as it looks to forge a post-EU sanctions policyare increasingly adopting “thematic values-based policies” that target such miscreants says Emil Dall of the Royal United Services Institute RUSI a think-tankThis sophistication is partly a matter of necessity Targets were once mostly economic small fry such as Cuba and North Korea; now they include much bigger fish such as China and Russia As targets have grown so has the potential for collateral damage A blanket embargo on China for locking up Uyghurs say could produce intolerable economic blowbackLarge targets however also feel more emboldened to hit back China responded to the Xinjiang sanctions with counter-measures against European politicians diplomats and a think-tank Its growing economic clout means it can wound when it retaliates It may also over the longer term have a corrosive effect on sanctions: the more the large targets respond by seeking to reduce their reliance on American finance and technology the weaker America global economic leverage becomesand the less potent sanctions’ impactThe first recorded use of sanctions was in 432BC when the Athenian Empire banned traders from Megara from its marketplaces thereby strangling the rival city-state economy However “not until the 20th century did modern concepts of international sanctionsa collective denial of economic access designed to enforce global orderbecome prominent” writes Benjamin Coates a historian in an essay published last yearThe League of Nations led in forging multilateral sanctions in the early 20th century The UN later did the same against obnoxious regimes from white-supremacist Rhodesia to Saddam Hussein Iraq America for its part stepped up its unilateral sanctions after the second world war OFAC was created in 1950 a decade after a forerunner had been set up to freeze the US assets of the Danish and Norwegian governments in order to stop the Nazis seizing them During the cold war Congress gave the president new powers to impose sanctions Cuba was a favourite targetUse intensified in the 1990s with America targeting Iran as it flirted with nuclear-bomb-making But the most dramatic shift in America approach followed the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 The Patriot Act passed soon after targeted terrorist coffers Thus began an era of more carefully tailored or “smart” sanctions that sought to hamstring terrorists dictators and others by restricting their access to American-owned or influenced financial plumbing an example of the latter being the SWIFT interbank network This change of tack “made sanctions so much more powerful than they were before” says Mr CoatesDouble-edged swordsAnother inflection point came around 2010 as America upped its use of “secondary sanctions” which target not only the perceived bad guys but also threaten anyone doing business with them with financial excommunication Their power was most apparent in Iran: European firms saw golden opportunities there after the 2015 nuclear deal but backed away in droves after Mr Trump reimposed sanctions and added secondary ones in 2018American policy has undergone two further shifts over the past decade The first sparked by Russia annexation of Crimea in 2014 was to go after bigger fish America and other Western powers unveiled sanctions against dozens of Russian agencies companies and members of Mr Putin circle In doing so they were taking on an economy more than twice the size of any other previously targeted with such comprehensive sanctionsThe second shift was Mr Trump splattergun approach So varied were his targets and so devoid of diplomacy his manner he once threatened to “obliterate” the economy of Turkey a NATO ally during a spat over Syria that sanctions wonks were left wondering if there was any method in the madness But his administration undeniably displayed creativity “What Trump came upon were nuances in ways to target big players like Russia and China with sanctions that were not quite sanctions” says a former OFAC official His restrictions on Chinese tech and telecoms firms for instance hit their ability to design chips source components or operate effectively in many Western countriesThey also greatly added to the stress on banks and companies that have to comply with sanctions Unlike conventional sanctions which work by freezing trade the financial sort “turn private actors into enforcers” says Mr Coates The cost of steering clear of blacklisted people and entities has risen relentlessly especially for banks An executive at one global bank says that after being caught and fined for breaching American sanctions it has spent “a couple of billion” dollars on hiring more compliance people and installing better screening technology to avoid a repeatA big outlay to be sure but falling foul of OFAC can cost even more Until around a decade ago sanctions enforcement was a technocratic backwater Today penalties can run into the billions with operating restrictions often tacked on to increase the pain In 2014 BNP Paribas a French bank pleaded guilty to processing thousands of transactions involving countries blacklisted by America paid an $89bn fine and was forced to suspend its dollar-clearing operations in New York for a yearThe cost would be easier to bear if sanctions usually achieved their aims Measuring success is difficult; even American government departments involved in sanctions don’t carry out their own assessments But it is clear that many fail The maximum-pressure measures against Iran have neither dislodged its theocratic regime nor halted its nuclear ambitions; the country has more enriched uranium now than when Mr Trump took officeMoreover sanctions provoke counter-measures The most direct way is for the target country to issue counter-sanctions An alternative is to use legal mechanisms to negate sanctions “Blocking statutes” aim to shield domestic companies by prohibiting them from complying with another country sanctions The EU statute dates back to the 1990s and was strengthened after Mr Trump pulled out of the Iran accord It has sparked litigation in Britain Germany and the Netherlands and several cases are before the European Court of Justice ECJ In Britain Metro Bank is being sued by a group of Iranian clients who argue that the bank closure of their accounts without warningafter Metro found it had breached American sanctionsviolated the blocking statute The outcomes will have big implications for European firms operating in Iran or wishing to but caught between competing sanctions regimes China issued a blocking statute in January based on Europe but is yet to flesh out the extraterritorial measures to which it appliesThe use of courts to challenge sanctions goes beyond blocking statutes Maya Lester a London-based barrister has worked on several cases on the impact of sanctions on commercial contracts and many more involving individuals and entitiesincluding Iranian bankssuing to be removed from blacklists Several have succeeded There are legal challenges in America too Last year a court halted Mr Trump attempted blacklisting of TikTok In March a federal judge suspended a similar ban on Xiaomi a smartphone-makerThe biggest long-term threat to sanctions’ effectiveness involves efforts by targets to circumvent them A time-honoured way to do this is to trade through sanctions-busters: black-marketeers using shell companies fake trade paperwork and other dark arts Turkey and Dubaiparticularly the latter trading houses and free-trade zoneshave been weak links in enforcing Western sanctions on IranMore important countries targeted by sanctions and those that want to trade with them are exploring ways to decouple economically from those that impose them particularly America China has responded to American technology bans by scaling up plans to invest in producing chips at home It is also trying to reduce its reliance on the dollar and American banks by for instance making the yuan more appealing in international financeDigitisation might help it do so China central bank is a world leader in developing a digital currency which is being tested in several cities It “could fundamentally change how Chinese companies do business by 2022 or 2023” says the head of one globally active bank If successful it may then start to be adopted in other parts of Asia and later farther afield China would also like to loosen America grip on the cross-border payments infrastructure It has its own version of SWIFT called CIPS which simplifies cross-border payments in yuanEurope too is seeking to strengthen its single currency role in global commerce The euro is now used to settle some international oil shipments for instance by commodities firms buying from Russia The oil trade has traditionally been denominated in dollars Russia capital markets have become much less reliant on foreign investors since the Crimea-linked sanctions were imposed seven years agoone reason why its markets shrugged off America latest restrictionsIt would be easy to exaggerate this trend The EU attempt to create a barter mechanism to help its firms get around American sanctions has failed to take off China financial system is opaque and largely closed The yuan accounts for just 24% of global payments while the dollar makes up 38% CIPS is minuscule Still the direction of travel is clearFor now the sanctions-compliance world remains fixated on policy in Washington There are few signs of a significant let-up in the pressure applied by the Trump administration except perhaps with strict conditions on Iran That said Mr Biden is likely to work harder than his predecessor to “pair sanctions with diplomacy” says RUSI Mr DallThe changes in China approach to sanctions however may be more dramatic It shows signs of becoming more assertive including by being quicker to retaliate It has growing leverage as a huge market for foreign firms hawking everything from consumer goods to commodities and as financier-in-chief of America national debt It may also be developing a taste for pre-emptive sanctions A report by the Centre for a New American Security a think-tank counted ten such cases in 2010-18 triple the number in 1978-2000 In 2019 China announced sanctions on American arms-makers that supply Taiwan More recently it imposed an unofficial ban on Australian coal over Canberra “offensive” anti-China rhetoricChina will also continue to try to turn Western sanctions to its advantage They have helped it advance its interests abroad for instance by filling the economic void left by American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela In March China reportedly signed a $400bn 25-year deal to invest in Iran energy sector and upgrade its transport and manufacturing infrastructureThis increased muscle-flexing underlines that the world of sanctions is becoming less unipolar China reach may be limited by its small role in international finance relative to trade But its share is growing and it is not alone in looking for ways to reduce reliance on the greenback A China no longer reliant on America or other outsiders for financial plumbing or critical technologies is likely to feel more emboldened to say attack TaiwanAnd this raises the spectre of the irreversible shift Mr Lew warned of: that a tool designed to be one of the most forceful expressions of American power instead fatally undermines its economic hegemony The stakes could hardly be higher A version of this article was published online on April 21st 2021
 Apr 22nd 2021,The woes of Huarong pose dilemmas for Beijing,Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKTHE EXECUTIVES of Huarong Asset Management have not been able to hide from China authorities A corruption probe into the state-owned financier in April 2018 sent senior staff and business partners scattering abroad only to be rounded up in an international dragnet One casino tycoon with close links to Huarong was captured in Cambodia Its former chairman Lai Xiaomin was put to death in January for what a Chinese court called egregious financial crimes and bigamy Until recently the company proved much better at hiding its debt and disguising losses Huarong which as of June had 17trn yuan $262bn in assets is thought to have lent with abandon to some of China riskiest borrowers Three years after regulators began mucking out the mess left by its previous management the risks are spilling into global marketsThe first sign of trouble came when the company failed to issue its financial statements for 2020 by the deadline of March 31st It attributed the delay to a “relevant transaction” that auditors needed more time to assess Then Caixin a financial publication reported that a significant restructuring was being discussed sending its bond prices to record lows By mid-April its debt securities were trading at junk prices though its state backing meant that it kept its investment-grade rating Regulators kept mum for weeks allowing panic to spread to other state-owned securities before declaring on April 16th that Huarong had ample liquidity This eased some concerns over the $22bn in offshore bonds held by global investors On April 20th Huarong offshore financing unit sought to allay worries further saying it returned to profit in the first quarterYet the spectre of restructuring or default at a group in which the Ministry of Finance has nearly a 60% stake continues to rattle markets Larry Hu of Macquarie an investment bank noted that the turbulence at Huarong is “likely to be the beginning of a series of credit events in 2021”The concerns are justified Huarong one of four distressed-asset management companies AMCs is among China most powerful financial institutions Created in the late 1990s to deal with 13trn yuan in bad debts from the country four largest commercial banks the groups have thrived as China banking system continued to produce mounds of dud credit as of June Huarong alone held 841bn yuan worth of distressed assets Originally designed to be wound down as the first cache of toxic assets were worked out or liquidated the AMCs have instead become sprawling conglomerates both within China and in Hong Kong Under the direction of Mr Lai Huarong transformed into an investment bank with dozens of subsidiaries doing everything from real-estate and securities broking to insurance and high-yield cross-border lending Many of its losses are thought to be linked with loans it made to companies that have since gone bustThe AMC business model has been highly controversial Instead of merely buying soured debts from commercial banks they began borrowing at low rates from banks and then lending last-resort funds at high cost to troubled companies A recent paper by Ben Charoenwong of the National University of Singapore and others concludes that AMCs have been in the business of concealing banks’ bad assets from regulators and often reselling them at inflated prices to investors that borrow heavily from the same banks This and other bad practices have led to a non-performing loan rate for commercial banks that could be two to four times higher than the officially reported 184% or 27trn yuan at the end of 2020 What is more China banks have largely recapitalised the AMCs through bond purchases notes Andrew Collier of Orient Capital ResearchOfficials are growing more comfortable with defaults at state-owned enterprises Late last year the default of Yongcheng Coal sent a clear signal that even important regional state firms could be allowed to fail But Huarong presents a much bigger and more systemic challenge for Beijing The suggestion of a restructuring has already started to reshape how investors view the country most powerful financial institutions Centrally controlled state firms have long been considered too big and too important to fail and therefore seen as prime targets for investment Any shift in that sense of security would force global investors to rethink how they invest in ChinaRegulators are “walking a very fine line” between financial stability and moral hazard says Ming Tan of S&P Global a rating agency They must weigh the potential for great financial instability if an institution of Huarong size collapses against the effects of bailing out a reckless conglomerate along with global investors They may have learnt too that bad assets however well disguised cannot stay hidden for everA version of this article was published online on April 20th 2021
 Apr 17th 2021,Profits at America banks are sky-high,THE GOOD old days seem to be returning to America Now that nearly 200m vaccine doses have been administered people are gathering in bars restaurants and shops The days are warmer and longer And banks are making returns on equity of 20% once moreListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt has been a while since Wall Street has been able to present the kind of stellar results that America's banks announced to their investors on April 14th JPMorgan Chase posted record revenues in the first quarter; those at Goldman Sachs were twice the level in the first quarter of 2020 Profits at Bank of America doubled on the year; those at Citigroup tripled Returns on tangible common equity a measure of profits relative to capital leapt to 20% at Citigroup 29% at JPMorgan and 33% at Goldman Not since before the global financial crisis more than a decade ago have the banks’ shareholders been so flush see chartTwo factors are behind the boom The first is the frenzied activity in capital markets in the first quarter The burst of activity in stock and bond markets partly spurred by the surge in retail trading sent JPMorgan investment-banking profits to a record high Firms rushed to go public and issue capital into frothy stockmarkets: equity-underwriting revenues were up by 40% at Goldman compared with the fourth quarter The craze for special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs lifted investment-bank revenues at Citigroup by more than 50% compared with the preceding quarter Dealmaking flooded back after a drought during the worst of the pandemic Goldman advisory fees were 40% higher than in the same period last year And more will come: David Solomon the bank boss told investors that the backlog of transactions it is scheduled to carry out is at an all-time highThe second factor behind banks’ robust results is a rosier outlook for America economy Continued government stimulus has led lenders to revise up their economic forecasts That in turn means that reserves that had been set aside in case loans soured are no longer needed JPMorgan wrote off $11bn for bad debts in the first quarter; but it also now expects $42bn of loans it once thought it would have to write off to be repaid allowing the sum to be counted as income This boosted profits by 30% Wells Fargo which also reported decent results on April 14th but does not benefit as much from busy capital markets added $1bn to its pre-tax income thanks to lower expected losses Bank of America added $19bn to its earnings for the same reasonBooming results probably help explain why some banks’ share prices have recovered their losses since March 2020 and have even made gains But neither driver of stellar earnings looks likely to last Though they have remained very strong for several consecutive quarters market revenues will probably eventually fall back to more normal levels Running down reserves set aside for bad loans cannot boost banks’ income indefinitelyYou only need to listen to bank bosses to understand how differentand difficultit is to run a bank in modern times Even as he told investors that the underlying results were “fabulous” Jamie Dimon the boss of JPMorgan lamented how much time his bank had dedicated to discussing the alphabet soup of regulations now levied on big lenders’ balance-sheets from CECL current expected credit losses to the SLR supplemental leverage ratio and the G-SIFI surcharge an extra capital charge for global systemically important financial institutionsAnd even as the pandemic has spurred record profits at many banks it has also put them in a tricky spot As the Federal Reserve bought up assets to support the economy its balance-sheet has ballooned Each asset bought by the Fed creates a new cash deposit that makes its way to accounts at the banks Stimulus cheques and robust capital markets meanwhile mean that demand for loans from households and companies is low The result is a pile-up of deposits especially at big banksand that in turn is causing post-crisis regulation to bind more tightly More deposits and liquid assets make for bigger banks in absolute terms which for instance increases the G-SIFI charge and makes leverage ratios look worse That seems perverse given that banks are actually safer “We have $22trn of deposits $1trn of loans and $15trn of cash and marketable securities much of which cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend” said Mr Dimon “How conservative do you want to get?”Regulators have toyed with the idea of relaxing some rules The SLR requires big banks to fund themselves with equity worth at least 5% of total assets In March 2020 a realisation that the Fed emergency actions had the unwanted effect of making the SLR bind more tightly led regulators to exclude cash reserves and Treasuries from the ratio calculation But extending this pragmatic and sensible exemption proved politically fraught and it expired at the end of March this year The good times may be back but they are not as good as they used to be

 Apr 15th 2021,John Williamson who defined the “Washington consensus” died on April 11th,IT WAS IN January 1947 with a song thrush that John Williamson began the list he kept of the birds he had seen which would go on to number some 4000 species His father a rose-grower in Hereford England was an avid birder too but Mr Williamson brought to the pastime the focused effort and aptitude for the collection of information that also characterised his work as a macroeconomist and expert on exchange rates Birding was an understated hobby for an understated man Yet Mr Williamson gained a measure of fame that eludes most economists when he outlined the “Washington consensus”: a description of policy orthodoxy in the late 1980s that became a flashpoint for intense global debate Mr Williamson who died on April 11th at the age of 83 sought merely to gather a list of macroeconomic best practices the better to boost the welfare of people in developing economies In that he succeeded the furore that followed notwithstandingListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThough Mr Williamson had notions of becoming an engineer a schoolteacher suggested that his maths was too poor and that he should pursue economics instead As an undergraduate at the London School of Economics he was inspired by William Phillips who showed him a draft of a paper describing a relationship between unemployment and inflationor the Phillips curve as it would become known At Princeton University as a graduate student he rubbed shoulders with giants of the profession like William Baumol and Oskar MorgensternMr Williamson academic work focused on exchange rates He began his professional career as the post-war monetary system in which many currencies were pegged to the dollar which in turn was pegged to gold began to creak under the pressure of an overvalued greenback Mr Williamson believed that persistently over- or undervalued currencies were a source of economic damage But he was also sceptical of radical reform proposals: to allow exchange rates to float freely for example or to save the system by turning the IMF into a global central bank Instead he advocated what he saw as a pragmatic idea: a crawling peg in which countries with persistent current-account imbalances realigned their exchange rates in a slow methodical way He gained a reputation as an exchange-rate guru with work taking him to Britain Treasury the IMF and universities in America Britain and BrazilIt was the Washington consensus though for which he was best known Its original context is often forgotten In the 1960s and 1970s booming Latin American countries borrowed heavily to fund infrastructure projects and industrialisation When interest rates soared in the early 1980s those debts became unpayable and a wave of defaults threatened American politicians fearing for their country heavily exposed banks introduced a series of plans to coax as much repayment as possible from the region They grew frustrated however at what they took to be Latin American governments’ lack of interest in structural reform Mr Williamsonwho by then had moved to what is now the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tankknew better and proposed convening a conference to correct such misapprehensions He wrote a document to help frame the proceedings; the Washington consensus was described withinThe paper sought to capture what Washington intelligentsia agreed were broadly sensible policies There were ten planks which Mr Williamson later summarised as encompassing “macroeconomic discipline a market economy and openness to the world” Wild-eyed radicalism it was not; the list was intended after all to reflect only the policies that almost everyone in Washington thought wise Mr Williamson did not endorse knee-jerk austerity; he emphasised redirecting industrial subsidies towards education and health Exchange rates should be competitive but not necessarily freely floating Openness meant acceptance of imports and direct investment but not full capital mobility Deregulation meant liberating sheltered sectors not gutting environmental and labour standards It was more a practical guide to avoiding disaster than a manifestoThe consensus soon came to mean something else entirely though Critics associated it with the ideological revolutions of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher which they interpreted as fierce hostility to any state intervention When financial crises racked the developing world in the 1990s its woes were blamed on the consensus which was caricatured as a foolhardy attempt to impose orthodoxy on vulnerable places regardless of local conditions The term became a catchall for neoliberalism its excesses and failures real and imagined Economists found themselves asking whether and how the consensus had gone wrong; Mr Williamson himself acknowledged in 2002 that the term had become a “damaged brand name” Yet he was also philosophical about his brainchild tumultuous public life and continued quietly to explain what his creation was and was not meant to includeFlight of the concordThere is not much consensus to be found today in Washington and many old orthodoxies are being questioned Still countries that hewed more closely to Washington consensus policies in recent decadeslike Chile or Colombiahave kept clear of big crises while others like Argentina and Venezuela have not Discipline and openness alone may not unlock a growth miracle; yet if they help countries avoid costly setbacks that is no small thingIndeed purposeful pragmatism is not a bad way to approach daunting challenges of all sorts The developing world will have more than macroeconomics to worry about in years to come as Mr Williamson who long advocated for action against climate change well understood He was a committed environmentalist a sentiment deepened by treks through woods and fields in search of his birds That sensible sacrifices should be made to protect such things: on this surely reasonable people can agree

in fact it turned out to be only 68% That was the biggest overestimate in the history of the survey and more than three times the next highest such error In February this year forecasters expected unemployment in the second quarter to average 61% only for it to fall below that rate in March If the labour market continues to outperform expectations the economy will eat up slack and push up inflation soonerAt that point the Fed will face a choice Its new policy framework seeks to overshoot its 2% target temporarily after recessions in order to make up lost ground But it has been vague about what this “average-inflation targeting” means in practice Some recent speeches by officials have suggested that the central bank needs to compensate for lost inflation since last spring Others have implied that August is the starting point for catch-up policy as that is when the framework changed But there has been no inflation shortfall since August see bottom panel on chart If the springtime bump in inflation does not melt away the central bank will be forced to decide precisely what it wantsA version of this article was published online on April 13th 2021
 Apr 12th 2021,The war against money-laundering is being lost,YET ANOTHER bank is preparing to face the music over alleged failings in its efforts to curb flows of dirty money In the coming weeks NatWest one of Britain largest lenders is set to appear in court in London to respond to charges that it failed to properly scrutinise a gold-dealing client that deposited £365m $502m with the bank£264m of it in cashListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNatWest which has said it is co-operating with investigators is the latest lender to be accused of falling short in the fight against dirty money Last year global banks were hit with $104bn in fines for money-laundering violations an increase of more than 80% on 2019 according to Fenergo a compliance-software firm In January Capital One an American bank was fined $390m for failing to report thousands of fishy transactions Danske Bank is still dealing with the fallout of a scandal that erupted in 2018 Over $200bn of potentially dirty money was washed through the Danish lender Estonian branch while executives missed or ignored a sea of red flagsThese cases imply that banks remain the Achilles heel in the global war on money-laundering despite the reams of regulations aimed at turning them into frontline soldiers in that conflict However closer examination suggests that the global anti-money-laundering AML system has serious structural flaws largely because governments have outsourced to the private sector much of the policing they should have been doing themselvesA study published last year by Ronald Pol a financial-crime expert concluded that the global AML system could be “the world least effective policy experiment” and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot seized A report based on a survey of professionals published last year by LexisNexis an analytics firm found that worldwide spending on AML and sanctions compliance by financial institutions including fund managers insurers and others as well as banks exceeds $180bn a yearMoney-laundering was not even a crime across much of the world until the 1980s Since then countries from Afghanistan to Zambia have been arm-twisted particularly by America into passing laws The effort intensified after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the passage of America Patriot Act which targeted money trails financing terrorism and other crimeAML compliance has since become a huge part of what banks do and created large new bureaucracies It is not unusual for firms such as HSBC or JPMorgan Chase to have 3000-5000 specialists focused on fighting financial crime and more than 20000 overall in risk and complianceThe AML push has succeeded in stamping out the most pernicious practices such as using shell banks those with no real customers in sunny places to launder suitcases stuffed with drug money But criminals have not been forced to get particularly creative: it is not much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago to rinse dirty money by setting up a shell company disguising the loot flowing through it as legitimate revenue and persuading an established bank to process itAs a result the numbers tell of a war being lost The “Global Threat Assessment” a report by John Cusack an ex-chair of the Wolfsberg Group an association of banks that helps develop AML standards estimates that $58trn-worth of financial crime was perpetrated in 2018equivalent to 67% of global GDP Statistics on how much is intercepted by authorities are patchy A decade-old estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime put it at just 02% of the total In 2016 Europol estimated the confiscation rate in Europe to be a higher but still paltry 11%Some experts think the success rate may have fallen in recent years in part because of the rise of “trade-based money-laundering”which moves dodgy money into the legitimate economy by playing tricks with paperwork for cross-border trade The covid-19 pandemic too has boosted opportunities for financial ne’er-do-wells Criminals have set up shell companies to exploit vast poorly policed government-aid schemes In Britain the authorities have received more than 50000 reports of potential misuse of its “Bounce Back Loans” and furlough schemesShell shockThe Financial Action Task Force FATF the intergovernmental body that sets global AML standards admits to problems with the system Last October its president Marcus Pleyer accused the “vast majority” of countries of failing to tackle money-laundering Some countries have been able to achieve solid marks in the organisation assessments by passing nice-looking AML laws only to water them down later or fail to implement key provisions One offender is the United Arab Emirates where weak enforcement has helped Dubai become a haven for corrupt capital But America and Britain also look to game the FATF process albeit less egregiouslyGlobal efforts to stamp out money-laundering have if anything waned over the past five years says Robert Barrington of the University of Sussex In 2016 David Cameron Britain then prime minister hosted a global anti-corruption summit and other governments queued up to back the cause But it proved a false dawn Britain became distracted by Brexit In America President Donald Trump showed scant leadership on the issue China and Russia have stymied attempts to co-ordinate action against corruptionThree big problems hobble the fight against financial crime: a lack of transparency; a lack of collaboration; and a lack of resources Start with transparency Investigators often struggle to identify the real “beneficial” owners of shell companies who often hide behind legal nomineesSome progress has been made in increasing visibility Britain launched a public register of company owners in 2016 spurring several others to follow suit Britain offshore satellites such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey have been pressed into setting up registers or strengthening existing ones America recently passed a law requiring ownership data on firms registered at state level including in Delaware incorporation factories to be held in a federal registerHowever many countries still eschew registers and those that have them have faced problems In Britain criminals have been willing to risk filing false information or none at all given the modest penalties for doing so Hong Kong meanwhile plans to scale back the details company owners must disclose on its registerThe FATF is seeking to toughen its standard on beneficial-ownership transparency; the current version says merely that “competent authorities” should have access to such information “in a timely fashion” But getting its 39 core membersfrom America and the EU to China and Russiato agree on a new text will be difficultThe second problem lack of collaboration hobbles governments’ work with each other and with banks on the front line The big money-laundering schemes are sophisticated and transnational while anti-laundering efforts remain balkanised Information-sharing between governments is improving thanks to co-operation among “financial-intelligence units” national centres that collect data on suspicious transactions But the “mutual legal assistance” system which countries investigating crimes use to request information from each other is clunkyAs for data flowing to and from banks the benefits of sharing are indisputable “The value of information coming from a network of banks is thousands of times higher than the information any one bank has because you can see not just where the money came from but where it went and where it went from there and so on” says the head of a large international bank Unfortunately the level of collaboration is “terrible” America does best thanks to the Patriot Act but even there information-sharing is “on a tiny scale” Anything more requires a warrant from a judge “which is hard if you don’t know what the crime is yet” Britain is in second place he says with “about 30%” of the data-sharing done in America And in third place? “No one”A daunting obstacle to sharing information is data-privacy laws which in many places prevent banks from passing information to authorities particularly foreign ones Some big banks have lobbied for exceptions to be made for AML but “governments don’t see it as a legislative priority” says an executive at another bankThe third difficulty a dearth of resources stems from the fact that white-collar crime is less visible than violent crime Spending on curbing the latter goes down better with the public In Britain fraud makes up more than a third of reported crime yet gets less than 1% of police resources in terms of officers Banks can spend all they like on AML but the criminals won’t end up in court if governments fail to invest in policing and prosecutionMany crime-fighting agencies lack the funding to properly analyse the torrent of “suspicious-activity reports” SARS banks file when they spot potentially dodgy transactions SARs are a cornerstone of the system But banks file too many low-quality or unnecessary reports because they are incentivised to cover their backs rather than to apply sensible risk criteria Globally they file millions of SARs a year; in America alone about 12m were submitted by deposit-takers last year see chartRed-tape revolutionIf the AML system is to be fit for purpose then governments must work harder together “Blaming banks for not ‘properly’ implementing [AML] laws is a convenient fiction” Mr Pol report concluded It also gives an unfair pass to the non-bank actors that enable corruption While fines for banks with poor AML controls have risen relentlessly lawyers who set up dodgy shell companies accountants who sign off on their fishy filings and the like have been getting away with slaps on the wrist Britain revenues and customs agency for instance supervises more than 30000 accountants estate agents and other businesses for money-laundering purposes; in the 2019-20 financial year it issued just 31 fines averaging £290000 Governments also need to get to grips with the AML implications of cryptocurrencies and the firms and exchanges that hawk themActivists who campaign to fix the cracks in the global AML architecture are pinning much hope on the Biden administration which has said that it views the fight against corruption as a national-security issue and therefore a priority Whether it can work more profitably than its predecessor with Europe which is overhauling AML oversight in the wake of the Danske debacle remains to be seen Hopes that China can be persuaded to co-operate are not high Either way bankers should probably brace for another beating A version of this article appeared online on April 12th 2021
 Apr 10th 2021,The IMF marks up the global recovery,ON APRIL 6TH the IMF raised its forecasts for the global economic recovery The cause?

To be sure compared with many cash-guzzling unicorns tech startups worth more than $1bn Coinbase looks mature In the past quarter users traded about $335bn-worth of currencies on its platform They also held $223bn in its accountsmore than a tenth of the value of all cryptocurrenciesFounded in 2012 Coinbase always wanted to be more than a place where people buy and sell digital monies It aimed instead to become a bridge between the anarchic cryptoworld and conventional finance Though its history has been tumultuous at times the firm is not far from its goal: users do not need a degree in cryptography to benefit from its services though its customer support is notoriously wanting; it is on mostly good terms with regulators and banks; and unlike other cryptoexchanges it has so far avoided becoming the victim of a catastrophic hackYet in other respects the firm prospects are uncertain Although it has branched out somewhat and now offers services to store and save cryptoassets transaction fees still made up 96% of its revenue last year This not only means that its fortunes rely heavily on the health of the cryptoeconomy which can be volatile; it also means that its take could shrink if competition muscles in Of the $335bn in trades in the first quarter of 2021 it kept about 05% in feesmuch more for instance than Nasdaq the stock exchange on which Coinbase will listThe Himalayan valuation could start to make sense if the cryptoeconomy continues to thrive and if conventional exchanges do not get religionadmittedly two big ifs Coinbase then might seem best placed to reap the rewards and become the centre of an “open financial system for the world” as its IPO prospectus puts it “For many of our customers they simply think of us as their primary financial account in the cryptoeconomy” writes Brian Armstrong the firm boss Like other promising startups that have recently gone public Coinbase sees itself powered by an accelerating “flywheel” tech-speak for a virtuous cycle: more customers means more liquidity which allows the firm to accept more cryptoassets and offer more services in turn attracting more customers and so onEven then however Coinbase would have to remedy some imbalances to really take off One is getting so caught up in its flywheel that it can’t do anything else a malaise from which other big tech firms suffer Both Google and Facebook for instance are still essentially advertising businesses Coinbase for all its ambitions might get stuck being mainly an exchangeAnother question mark is management Mr Armstrong is willing to learn from mistakes and eventually got things right but he is no tech leader in the mould of a Steve Jobs or an Elon Musk A self-described introvert he cannot carry off his vision of bringing crypto to the masses by the sheer force of his personality writes Jeff John Roberts a journalist in his recent book “Kings of Crypto” a profile of Coinbase That helps explain why the firm history has been one of delayed decisions and infightingAnd then there is the inherent contradiction of trying to be a big if not dominant player in a world that by definition is meant to be fragmented or “decentralised” in the lingo If crypto becomes as successful as Coinbase wants it to be there may be no need for a financial behemoth In fact the firm most dangerous rivals may be neither its peers such as Binance and Kraken nor conventional financial institutions but those without a big organisation behind themfully decentralised like most cryptocurrencies themselves Editor note April 14th 2021: This article has been updated since it was first published 
 Apr 10th 2021,Totting up bitcoin environmental costs,AS COINBASE’S IPO shows cryptocurrencies have many fans But they have detractors too Environmentalists in particular fret about how much energy bitcoin uses In a paper in Nature Communications a group of academics led by Dabo Guan of Tsinghua University and Shouyang Wang at the Chinese Academy of Sciences examine bitcoin energy use in China They conclude that in the absence of legal curbs bitcoin could by 2024 become a “non-negligible” barrier to China efforts to decarbonise its economyListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKBitcoin hunger for energy stems from its design It forgoes centralised record-keeping in favour of a “blockchain” a transaction database that is distributed among users The blockchain is maintained by “miners” who validate transactions by competing to crack mathematical puzzles with solutions that are hard to find but easy to check Each successfully mined block of transactions generates a reward currently 625 bitcoins $357000The system varies the difficulty of the puzzles to ensure that one new block is created on average every ten minutes High bitcoin prices make it worthwhile to spend more computing powerand therefore electricitychasing mining rewards But bitcoin automatic stabilisers will ramp up the mathematical difficulty in response Like the Red Queen in “Through the Looking-Glass” competing miners find themselves running faster simply to stand stillDespite the currency democratic ambitions mining is concentrated among a handful of professional operators About 70% takes place in China The researchers use economic modelling to try to work out how much carbon all this make-work produces They conclude that without regulation Chinese bitcoin mining could consume around as much energy as Italy or Saudi Arabia by 2024 Annual carbon emissions at 130m tonnes would approach those of NigeriaSuch numbers should be taken with a good deal of salt Bitcoin energy use depends crucially on its price which swings wildly The authors assume that the long-term trend will be upward because the rate at which new bitcoins are created is designed to halve every four years Reality will doubtless prove more complicated But the general picturethat bitcoin is a dirty businessfits with other research One oft-cited model which uses publicly available blockchain data reckons its global energy consumption is already equal to that of Kazakhstan and that its carbon footprint matches Hong Kong
 Apr 8th 2021,Robert Mundell an influential international economist has died,AFTER ACCEPTING the Nobel prize in economics in 1999 Robert Mundell crooned “My Way” the song by Frank Sinatra to guests at the banquet His way as he put it involved falling in love with economic theory obtaining a PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and spending time in London writing his thesis It also involved crafting foundational ideas in the field of international economics including one that earned him the title of a father of the euro He died on April 4th at the age of 88Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMr Mundell attributed some of his interest in international economics to Canada the country of his birth In the 1950s it had unusually a floating not a fixed exchange rate It also contended with large capital flows to and from America What became known as the Mundell-Fleming model sought to explain the implications of Canada setupForeign investors seek at least the prevailing global rate of return If the central bank raises interest rates investors rush in threatening any currency peg When exchange rates are fixed and capital is mobile monetary policy can therefore only reflect global conditions Canada floating rate however gave it monetary-policy autonomy Students today learn about the “trilemma”: countries cannot have mobile capital control of monetary policy and a currency peg They must pick two of the threeIf capital is mobile then choosing a fixed exchange rate means the job of keeping the economy stable falls to fiscal policy alone But Mr Mundell also showed that if countries choose floating rates as Canada had then fiscal stimulus can become less effective It strengthens the currency crimps exports and leaves overall demand unchangedAs fixed exchange rates fell out of favour Mr Mundell analysis looked prescient Yet some countries remained committed to pegs Partly inspired by deeper European integration in 1961 he set out the conditions in which an “optimum” currency area could thriveA currency union lowers the costs of trade But it removes a cushionthe exchange ratethat would otherwise protect its members against localised blows Mr Mundell showed that this need not be a problem if say workers moved from depressed areas to thriving ones In 2006 he noted that he was first called a father of the euro by the currency sceptics But his theory could be used to show that the euro zone lacked the labour mobility needed to be an optimum currency area Still he backed the project noting that the European Commission sends money to depressed regions reducing the need for emigrationMr Mundell also helped found supply-side economics which advocated tax cuts to encourage investment and gained favour in the 1980s If the cuts boosted activity enough they might even raise revenue an idea that is debated within the profession After he won the Nobel Mr Mundell said he met heads of state as often as finance ministers “When I say something people listen Maybe they shouldn’t but they do”
 Apr 8th 2021,In poor countries statistics are both undersupplied and underused,IN THE RICH world people worry that prying governments know too much about them Popular culture valorises characters who go off the grid like Jack Reacher the hero of 25 novels by Lee Child and two films starring Tom Cruise He drifts around America on Greyhound buses eschewing a driving licence credit cards and email Why does he make himself so hard to find? “It started out as an exercise and became an addiction” he saysListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe developing world however is full of unwitting Jack Reachers who leave little trace in official records Their anonymity is not an addiction but an affliction According to the World Bank latest World Development Report entitled “Data for Better Lives” about 1bn people have no official proof of their identity More than a quarter of the world children under five are not registered at birth Half of the 29 poorest countries have not completed a census in the past ten yearsCongo has not done one since 1984and only 40% have three or more estimates of poverty that can be compared across time Christopher Yeh of Stanford University and his colleagues have calculated that an African household will appear in a representative survey of living standards less than once every 1000 yearsGiven the shortage of conventional statistics many people are enthusiastic about more novel forms of data gleaned from mobile phones social media and satellite imagery In the early months of the covid-19 pandemic patterns of mobile-phone use showed who could and could not afford to stay at home in a city like Jakarta outlining the uneven impact of lockdown measures in many developing countries That kind of data can help donors better target their aid efforts Emily Aiken of the University of California Berkeley and her colleagues have tested whether a machine-learning algorithm can identify the poorest households in 80 Afghan villages based on mobile-phone data such as the duration of their calls their network of contacts and how often they paid for more minutes of call-time For the 80% of households that owned a mobile phone the algorithm worked about as well as more traditional targeting methods such as counting fridges clothes irons and other physical assetsBut as the study authors are careful to note not everyone owns a mobile phone And algorithms that work in one place and time may not necessarily travel well or endure for long Joshua Blumenstock of Berkeley has pointed out that international calls may be a less reliable indicator of prosperity during the Haj pilgrimage season when many more people travelSatellite imagery avoids some of these problemscameras in orbit can see how the other half lives Countries can sharpen poverty maps by combining household surveys with clues visible from space including building sizes forest cover and the intensity of night-time lights Tanzania was able to turn a poverty map divided into 20 mainland regions containing populations of over 2m on average into a higher-resolution poverty map of 169 districts containing average populations of 300000 or so The extra precision provided by satellite data was equivalent to increasing the sample size of a household survey by five times according to Takaaki Masaki of the World Bank and his co-authorsThese techniques can all improve the supply of data But supply is not the only problem If it were you would expect any figures a government did collect to be highly prized widely disseminated and heavily used But the opposite is too often the case Data are rarely shared with outsiders And they are poorly digested even within official circles Daniel Rogger and Ravi Somani of the World Bank once asked over 1800 officials in Ethiopia how many people lived in their districts About half of them thought their districts were at least 50% bigger or smaller than they actually were according to figures in their own databases Education officials over- or underestimated primary-school enrolment numbers by 76% When asked less than 13% said that these administrative databases were their main source of informationBig Brother is watching out for himselfGovernments often lack a strong incentive to collect data use them well or allow others to use them better Bureaucrats with little discretion to make decisions have scant reason to inform themselves about what the right decision would be And in countries that lack strong safeguards to prevent data misuse civil servants understandably hold numbers close to their chests Moreover statistics can be most valuable when holding governments to account Why should governments conspire in their own embarrassment by providing the data by which they will be judged?For this reason the authors of the World Development Report call for something akin to a cultural shift in the handling of data They advocate for “political champions” who recognise data value in improving policies and a data-literate press and public who demand better numbers to draw on This political commitment to data would in turn generate incentives for civil servants to make better use of the figures at their disposal The mindset of ministries can be as important as a government financial wherewithal According to new indicators from the World Bank a country statistical performance is only loosely correlated with its prosperity Some countries like Kyrgyzstan or Mexico do much better than you would expect given their level of GDP per personIn this vision private data and official statistics are complements not substitutes that can be of use for either corporate or public purposes One current example is the Gallup World Poll carried out by the private polling firm in over 140 economies Every three years it adds questions on financial inclusion instigated by the World Bank This polling showed that 17bn people lacked a formal bank account in 2017 That gap is both a potential business opportunity for financial firms and a problem for governments After all even Jack Reacher has a bank account

indeed it enacted its own version as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 Mr Biden is pushing new reforms He wants to raise the domestic federal corporate rate partially reversing Donald Trump cuts from 21% to 28%and crucially increase the rate on American firms’ overseas profits from 105% to at least 21% calculated on a country-by-country basis so that it captures all tax havensThe hope is that the receipts help fund a planned $2trn-plus upgrade to the country infrastructure Republicans in Congress and groups representing big business complain that higher tax rates dent American competitiveness That argument is blunted if other large economies agree to set a floor for the global rateThe minimum tax is one of two “pillars” at the centre of the OECD-brokered negotiations Talks were reasonably constructive even with Team Trump say officials But queasiness over setting a floor persists particularly among the EU lower-tax members such as Ireland with its lean corporate-tax rate of 125% Were a global minimum set at 21% American firms operating in Irelandof which there are manywould have to pay top-up tax of 85% to their government on top of the 125% paid to Dublin undercutting the Irish advantageMoreover most countries want negotiations over the two pillars kept togetherand the second pillar is much less tractable It involves finding a mutually acceptable way to carve up taxing rights over the profits of firms in markets where they have customers but lack a physical presence as is often the case for firms like Amazon and Facebook outside AmericaEarlier this year it was reported that Ms Yellen had dropped the Trump administration proposal to let American companies opt in to any new system for allocating taxing rights why any company would choose to do so is unclear That removed a large obstacle to a deal but by no means the only one Many of the firms targeted by DSTs pay an outsize share of their taxes to America government To strike a deal Ms Yellen will have to be unusually willing to share with other countriesThe most optimistic voices talk of agreement on both pillars being sealed by the end of June Many doubt that is possible It took years to agree on plucking and chucking lower-hanging fruit such as tax trickery involving intra-company loans or the “Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich” which channelled profits through EU-based subsidiaries to tax havens like Bermuda and the Cayman IslandsA key variable is the rate at which the global minimum is set Some officials think that after all the horse-trading it could be little more than the Irish rate of 125%not very different from the average cash-tax rate that American tech firms actually pay As for the reallocation of taxing rights even its champions accept it may not skim much more than $10bn in extra revenue globally The OECD estimates that corporate profit-shifting robs exchequers of $100bn-240bn a yearMeanwhile the Biden administration continues to flex muscle even as it speaks with a softer voice than its predecessor It is pressing on with plans to impose tariffs of as much as 25% on certain goods from six countries with DSTs including Britain and Turkey This is perhaps a tactic to encourage others to reach a deal at the OECD If so it is to be hoped that it works The alternative is a global tit-for-tat as national tech levies become the normA version of this article was published online on April 6th 2021

 Apr 3rd 2021,How has the IMF fared during the pandemic?,A YEAR AGO crisis gripped the global economy The world multilateral lender of last resort swung into action Speaking ahead of the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank which start on April 5th Kristalina Georgieva the fund managing director hailed its “unprecedented” actions including new financing for 85 countries and debt-service relief for 29 poor countries More help is on the way But is it enough?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe IMF offers its members a financial lifeline when they run out of cash Its support typically comes with demands for policy reforms and debt restructuring where needed to ensure that borrowers’ debts are sustainable Such conditionality helps guard the fund resources and avoid bailing out other creditors Going easy on borrowers today could encourage laxity in future inviting more crisesBut covid-19 was not a normal crisis The need for assistance was broad-based and urgent; meeting it was unlikely to encourage bad behaviour in future So the IMF raised limits on cheap emergency financing facilities which lend to countries with sustainable debts and attach relatively few strings; it offered poor countries debt-service relief; and it set up a “short-term liquidity line” SLL for fundamentally sound economiesSince March 2020 the fund has doled out $32bn in emergency financing and offered $74bn through other schemes Yet the support pales in comparison with the scale of the covid-19 crisis The fund lent more in the year to September 2009 during the global financial crisis; the 85 countries receiving help today make up only around 5% of global GDP The fund had expected an early wave of rapid financing to give way to more structured programmes with more strings attached But so far only 12 new deals have been approved Last April the IMF thought take-up of the SLL could be up to $50bn It has in fact been zeroThat is partly because while the IMF was drip-feeding credit to poor countries America Federal Reserve brought out the firehose blasting liquidity through its dollar swap lines That coaxed back investors who had fled emerging markets reducing the need for support And in some cases the mere offer of help from the IMF may have bolstered investors’ confidenceBut part of the low use of the IMF schemes has been of its own making Some governments were ineligible because of existing debt problems; others got less than they asked for say because of a perceived lack of need Other potential borrowers decided that the political stigma of turning to the IMF was too great or that doing so could raise doubts about their ability to service their private-sector debtsThe seeming lack of demand for the IMF services has led to some hand-wringing One question is whether the fund should alter its schemes In July Adnan Mazarei of the Peterson Institute for International Economics a think-tank and Matthew Fisher a former IMF official proposed a special pandemic support facility both to avoid setting awkward precedents for future borrowing and to reduce the stigma of turning to the IMFOusmène Mandeng another former official argued in the Financial Times that conditionality should be “recalibratedto reduce the political cost” The IMF board has considered a new pandemic facility but so far has decided against itInstead on March 22nd it extended the higher limits on its rapid-financing facilities and increased borrowing limits for poor countries It seems to be nudging those that have sought emergency financing towards more structured programmes where normal conditionality and oversight apply Indeed since September such programmes and precautionary support have accounted for around half of all approvals and a higher share of requestsThe IMF board has also expressed support for a new allocation of $650bn-worth of special drawing rights SDRs a special IMF currency that members can exchange for cash with no strings attached Most low- and middle-income countries would receive more help than they have obtained from covid-related IMF lending so far The poorest could benefit even more if the fund works out a way to reallocate SDRs from rich countries Once drawn SDRs would not need to be repaid but would incur interest currently 005% making them not quite as good as a grant but better than a loanAll told the fund approach may seem a muddle On the one hand it is encouraging borrowers to sign up for programmes with more conditions The SDR allocation on the other rejects strings entirely though regimes under sanctions might struggle to swap their SDRS for cash It could help borrowers repay Chinese creditors who perhaps should suffer write-downs For now though the muddle helps some of the countries in need And the fund may have lots of time to forge a more consistent approach It took until 2011 for IMF lending to peak after the global financial crisis 
 Mar 31st 2021,What the enthusiasm for funding startups means for the VC world,FINANCIAL MARKETS are fuelled by stories and the most skilful storytellers are found in venture capital For a start venture capitalists have to listen to a lot of fairy tales from the would-be entrepreneur “The world will look different in a decade” he says “My startup will be the leading business in a new industry” VCs tell themselves stories about how they can foresee what others cannot and how this stands to make them a lot of money And they retell them to potential investors in their fundsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWho to believe when you cannot easily verify such tales? This difficulty is a version of the agency problem of asset management When venture capital was clubbier it was manageable But in recent years investors who are new to the terrain have been piling in A VC trying to raise money may favour startups of the kind that has done well recently even if they are not the best long-term bet Oddball startups with more potential might then be starved of capital There is thus a nagging fear that the more money that is funnelled into Silicon Valley and other centres of venture capital the less “true” innovation will occur Well perhaps But it is not obvious that great business ideas are being ignored The downside of the flood of venture capital is more prosaic Run-of-the-mill startups are overindulged And prospective returns are depressed More and more pension schemes are looking to alternative investments including venture capital to juice up their returns VC funds have on average beaten the public market net of fees over the long run The best funds do a lot better than the average But it is not only a matter of returns Smart investors in public markets realise that they own a lot of companies that are at risk of disruption from emerging technology firms A good way to balance that risk is to own a stake in the next generation More money for new businesses is surely a good thing Nevertheless there is a lingering disquiet One source of discomfort is that funds are often narrowly segmented by region industry or stage of investmentand sometimes all three This helps with marketing Money is attracted to themes that have worked well recently As Hollywood has discovered it is easier to sell a variant of an old story than a brand-new oneThere are drawbacks though A truly game-changing business may sit astride several themes and be ignored says Ajay Royan of Mithril a VC firm based in Austin Texas In the public markets buying stuff that has worked well recently is called momentum trading It does fine much of the time and has an appeal to the investor who is out of his element in venture-land By “social-proofing” VC investments the anxious can get more comfortable with the risks says Mr Royan “But it can devolve into the VC equivalent of ‘you can’t get fired for buying IBM’” And the trouble with crowded trades is that they are prone to crashes Some VC funds will fall prey to the vices of asset gatheringtelling a good story about the latest fad to maximise the amount of fee-paying money under management But there is a culture that militates against this The best VC firms pride themselves on being oversubscribed They turn money away And an industry that hears a lot of fairy tales has some inbuilt discipline Venture capitalists have to kiss a lot of frogs to find a princeeven a halfway handsome frog The average VC firm screens 200 targets a year but makes only four investments according to one study And thematic VC can sometimes have a logic to it Regional funds make sense for consumer-facing startups because of local variations in tastes and habits Increasingly the seed or early-stage venture funds with better returns tend to have a thematic focus says Simon Levene of Mosaic Ventures a London-based VC firm Nor is it obvious that moonshot ideas are starved of funding SpaceX Elon Musk space-exploration firm was valued at a whopping $74bn at its most recent funding round Even borderline scams are given a respectful hearingThe trouble with abundant capital instead is more straightforward More money chasing scarce ideas and talent means that the prices paid for startups rise which all else equal means returns fall And the absence of cash constraints can spoil a promising startup If it blows a lot of money on marketing the resulting growth can distract the founders from underlying faults with the product Telling a good story is vital in the startup business But there is a danger in believing your own fairy tales

 Mar 31st 2021,The electric-car boom sets off a scramble for cobalt in Congo,ON THE STREETS of Kolwezi a mining city in the Democratic Republic of Congo huge billboards advertise “executive” mobile-phone-data packages a few gigabytes for a few dollars They are popular not just with the suited types shown on the hoardings; they also sell to more roughly dressed men who work in crude “artisanal” mines who use the data to check the price of cobalt “Every day we look at the LME” says Claude Mwansa a miner who lives in Kapata a neighbourhood where most people work in mining He means the London Metal Exchange where cobalt is tradedListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat price has soared from $30000 per tonne in January to nearly $52000 The reason is surging optimism about electric cars Carmakers are setting ambitious sales targets Joe Biden America president plans to replace the government fleet of vehicles with electric ones All this requires cobalt for batteries and 75% of the metal is mined in Congo Meeting the demand will not be easyBy value as much as 90% of cobalt mined in Congo comes from industrial firms such as Glencore an Anglo-Swiss trader and China Molybdenum a Chinese state enterprise which use modern methods to drill and refine the ore The rest comes from miners like Mr Mwansa who dig mostly by hand on land held by co-operatives or else illegally on land owned say by industrial firms They mainly sell to Chinese middlemen who operate “depots” that line the main road out of Kolwezi where they do basic processing and then transport the ore to South Africa or Tanzania to be shipped to ChinaYet by employment artisanal mining outweighs the industrial sort Glencore two mines employ around 15000 people; more than 200000 may work on artisanal sites “Creuseurs” work in hand-dug pits using shovels and pickaxes to get the ore out It is carried on people heads to rivers to be washed and transported on motorbikes Accidents are common Pits collapse; pumps refreshing the air fail But the money is good by Congolese standards Working three or four days a week all that most can physically manage a miner can make 100000 Congolese francs $50 Most Congolese live on less than $2 a dayMost buyers however want little to do with artisanal mining because of the poor working conditions and the use of child labour Apple and Tesla are among those being sued in America for using cobalt illegally mined on Glencore property by children who died Glencore is not a defendant The firms argue that the case should be dismissed and they should not be held responsible for the conditions of workers who mined cobalt they bought in a global supply chain where provenance was hard to trace Though some electronics firms have stopped using Congolese cobalt carmakers have little choicenowhere else generates as much Tesla has vowed but so far failed to engineer cobalt out of its batteries Last year it struck a deal with Glencore to buy “certified” cobaltGlencore says it does not sell artisanal cobalt but “recognises the legitimacy” of the practice It supports the “Fair Cobalt Alliance” which tries to improve conditions in artisanal mines But in practice the big firms have tried to cut off the industry Miners complain that walls have been erected and guards hired to keep them off sites they say are theirs Some now scramble over walls to mine at nightCongo government has its own solution On March 31st Gecamines the state mining firm announced the start of operations of a state enterprise with a legal monopoly on all artisanal cobalt This it says will help regulate conditions in the mines and also raise revenue Trafigura a Singapore-based commodities trader says it will help sell the output which will be certified by an NGO as free of child labour Soldiers have been sealing off artisanal mines since the plan was first announced in 2019Miners in Kapata say all they want is a free market “There are too many mafias here” says Mr Mwansa They worry that the new state firm will be an excuse for officials to extract more in bribes “The government just wants to steal” says Bernard Tshibangica another miner But buyers desperate for cobalt not tainted by child labour may see it otherwise 
 Mar 31st 2021,Governments have identified commodities essential to economic and military security,CUT DEEP into the desert rock of southern California are the jagged tiers of an open-pit mine Mountain Pass is North America only mine of rare-earth metals used in everything from fighter jets to the drive-trains of electric cars In 2015 Mountain Pass shut unable to compete with rare-earth producers in China But it has begun a new chapter MP Materials which bought the mine in 2017 said on March 18th that production in 2020 jumped by 40% More expansion is planned With grants awarded by America defence department last year MP Materials will build facilities to process rare earths part of an effort to secure supply independent from ChinaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAmerica support of Mountain Pass points to a broader phenomenon The trade war with China and covid-19 disruptions to supply chains have stoked fears of dependence on foreign production of medicine semiconductors and more Minerals have attracted particular attention both because they are essential to modern technologies such as batteries laser-guided missiles and wind turbines and because many minerals’ supply chains are controlled by China Faced with muscular Chinese industrial policy governments that long trusted companies to manage their own supply chains are stepping in In February Joe Biden White House issued an executive order to review the vulnerability of supply chains that are key to economic and national security including critical minerals and batteries The European Commission in September launched a public-private alliance to secure vital raw materials In March Australia unveiled a plan for processing critical minerals inviting companies to apply for public funds; Canada published a list of 31 critical minerals part of a plan to boost supply But if minerals show governments’ increased appetite for intervention they also reveal the limits of what that intervention might achieve quickly China is at least a decade ahead Shenghe Resources controlled by the Chinese state owns about 8% of MP Materials’ shares It is also Mountain Pass sole customerthe mine sends all its output to China for processingAmerica long guarded against supply disruptions by hoarding minerals in a national stockpile After the fall of the Soviet Union the need for one seemed less urgent and most of its contents were sold; proceeds went towards other military expenses and building a memorial to the second world war What was left was of questionable utility In 2008 a committee for the National Research Council charged by Congress with assessing the remaining stockpile concluded: “The department of defence appears not to fully understand its need for specific materials or to have adequate information on their supply” America strategic plan was essentially nothing of the kind China took a different approach In the 1980s Deng Xiaoping recognised the importance of the country deposits of rare earths such as neodymium and praseodymium “The Middle East has its oil” he said “China has rare earths” Support for mines and domestic processing meant that by 2010 China controlled about 95% of rare-earth mining The rest of the world was caught off guard when that year China sharply tightened export of the metals The move was aimed in part at rationalising a domestic industry plagued by illegal mining and environmental degradationby one estimate 300 square metres of topsoil was removed to recover each tonne of rare earths in southern China with more than 150 square kilometres of forest destroyed by mining near GanzhouHowever some observers saw the export restrictions as part of a dispute with Japan a large importer over the Senkaku Islands Politicians in Japan Europe and America woke up to the possibility that China could use its dominance in a key commodity to punish rivalsAmerica Europe and Japan prevailed against China export quotas in a dispute before the World Trade Organisation But in recent years concern about supplies of rare earths has intensified That is in part because China has continued to invest not just in rare earths but in foreign mines of key metals which are shipped to China for processingChina processes 72% of the world cobalt and 61% of its lithium according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies a think-tank and BloombergNEF a data group It is also because even if governments in America Europe and Japan were comfortable with China heft in mining and processing total investment in key minerals does not look commensurate with demandAs ambitions for clean energy grow the European Commission reckons that EU countries will need up to 18 times as much lithium and five times as much cobalt in 2030 as they do now “Europe transition to climate neutrality could replace today reliance on fossil fuels with one on raw materials many of which we source from abroad and for which global competition is becoming more fierce” the commission argued in September If the world moves to limit the rise in temperatures to 2°C above pre-industrial levels the World Bank estimates global production would need building up By 2050 output of cobalt graphite and lithium for instance would have to be more than 450% higher than in 2018 to meet battery demand The bank expects recycling to help a bit but large investment in new mines is still needed In a preview of what may be to come rising demand and constrained supply have recently pushed up the prices of lithium cobalt and neodymium-praseodymium oxideA battery of measuresFaced with such figures mining may seem set to attract a flood of capital Indeed the craze for special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs has reached the obscure metals on the lower rows of the periodic table One SPAC helped raise over $500m for MP Materials in November But total investment could still remain meagreMining projects are notoriously risky with investors wary that volatile commodity prices will threaten a given mine economics Some metals such as lithium still have no futures price clouding the outlook further “The markets are not as transparent or as fluid as oil” points out Morgan Bazilian of the Colorado School of Mines “and there not good price discovery”It doesn’t help that as investors become more concerned about environmental social and governance factors many mines tick all the wrong boxes Cobalt mining is concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo long plagued by corruption and child labour Countries with well-established legal systems are theoretically more attractive but bring their own problems Lithium Americas a Canadian company wants to build a lithium mine in northern Nevada It faces litigation over the effect on local groundwater and the greater sage grouse By the middle of the 2020s says Andy Leyland of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence a research group shortages of minerals for lithium-ion batteries could reverse the long decline in the price of batteries Raw materials account for about two-thirds of their costsRare earths illuminate the problem “If you have a back yard with rocks you have a rare-earth mine” says James Litinsky the chief executive of MP Materials “The challenge is the economics” China control of the processing industry gives it huge influence over rare-earth prices which has dissuaded a surge of investment elsewhere If that wasn’t disincentive enough separating rare earths has historically been both complex and environmentally damagingrare-earth minerals are often nestled beside radioactive ones And though rare earths are essential to enormous sectors such as defence transport and personal electronics collectively worth trillions of dollars the market for rare-earth oxides amounts to only about $5bn according to Adamas Intelligence a research groupThe result is that rare earths are attracting some investment but not enough Mountain Pass says Mr Litinsky can produce and separate rare earths in a sustainable manner the first steps towards creating a secure supply chain However Adamas estimates that by 2030 the world will face a shortage of neodymium-praseodymium oxide equivalent to about three times the annual output of Mountain Pass In the meantime Adamas expects prices to climb by 5-10% a year Japan provides one example of how governments outside China might intervene After China tightened exports of rare earths Japan moved more decisively to shore up supplies than governments in America or Europe Most important in 2011 the state-backed Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation JOGMEC and Sojitz a Japanese trading firm said they would supply $250m in loans and equity to Lynas an Australian miner of rare earths In exchange Japan would receive about 8500 tonnes of rare earths each year equivalent to about 30% of Japan demandJapan support of Lynas is broadly viewed as a success But the strategy brings risks After Chinese exports eased and rare-earth prices plunged Lynas was on the brink of collapse so in 2016 JOGMEC and Sojitz agreed to restructure the company debt Lynas processing plant in Malaysia faced controversy over radioactive byproducts JOGMEC other efforts to secure rare earths for instance ventures started over a decade ago in Canada and Kazakhstan have to date borne little fruit Some carmakers are beginning to think more seriously about battery supply chains Tesla has signed offtake agreements with Glencore which mines cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo; in March it became an adviser to a nickel mine in New Caledonia Its boss Elon Musk has even proposed mining its own lithium in Nevada using novel techniques However that plan has met scepticism from the mining industry itself; the broader situation looks sufficiently untenable that politicians in America and Europe are stepping in “There beginning to be a return to favour of more interventionist policies in activities which might have been viewed as strictly commercial” argues Roderick Eggert of America Critical Materials InstituteIn Europe mining and processing projects are now eligible for funds from the European Investment Bank The American defence department recent grants include not just those to Mountain Pass but to Lynas to build a rare-earths processing facility in Texas Last year America Development Finance Corporation took its first direct stake in a company: it invested $25m in TechMet a firm whose projects include a nickel and cobalt mine in BrazilSuch steps are not without controversy Europe public-private effort to support critical minerals includes a rare-earth project in Greenland in which Shenghe Resources has a stake Concern about that project environmental risks has galvanised an election in Greenland due to be held on April 6th In America senators including Ted Cruz and John Barrasso bristle not at government intervention but at its support for mining and processing abroad Messrs Cruz and Barrasso both Republicans represent states that have their own potential rare-earth projects Marco Rubio another Republican senator prefers creating an American co-operative of rare-earth suppliers exempt from antitrust policy Mr Leyland of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects some uptick in American mining with limits “These are going to be global supply chains” he says “because you can’t change geology”Mr Biden executive order on supply chains may turbocharge government involvement; by early June his deputies must present recommendations for shoring up such chains JOGMEC continues to show how governments’ activities might expand: its recent investments include mining for cobalt from Japan sea floor This may bring results The oil embargoes of the 1970s prompted impressive innovation in oil drilling and alternative energy However progress then as now can be slow Investments in recycling and in alternatives to scarce metals are both worthy and may take a decade to produce the desired outcome A typical mine Mr Leyland estimates can take at least five years to come online and sometimes many more That poses a problem Governments face two sources of intense time pressure: uncomfortable dependence on China as tensions escalate and the urgent need to limit climate change by deploying clean-energy technologies “Hopefully China will have more competition” says Brian Menell TechMet chief executive “but it has a big head-start” The main risk to clean-energy adoption argues Erez Ichilov of Traxys a trading house that backs mines of key battery metals is bottlenecks in

 Mar 31st 2021,Archegos a family office brings Nomura and Credit Suisse big losses,BEFORE FRIDAY March 26th few people may have heard of Archegos Capital Management an investment vehicle run by Bill Hwang a former hedge-fund trader with a chequered past But it has emerged as the entity behind a fire sale of at least $20bn-worth of equities which roiled stockmarkets on an otherwise unremarkable Friday and has left at least two global banksCredit Suisse and Nomurafacing multi-billion-dollar losses Financial regulators in America and Europe will have a say before the affair has run its courseListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe plotline has already taken shape Archegos is a so-called family office It manages the private wealth of Mr Hwang who once worked for Tiger Management a celebrated hedge fund One of Archegos strategies was long-short equity The main idea is to be indifferent to the direction of the overall market by betting that the share prices of some stocks will rise while the prices of other stocks fall The hope is that the longs do better than the shorts But when markets are volatile the strategy can come unstuck This is what seems to have happened to Archegos The first sign of trouble came that Friday when Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley two Wall Street behemoths began selling large blocks of shares for an unnamed client who had missed a margin calla demand for more collateral to cover losses on trades that had gone awry The stocks that were forcibly sold might best be categorised as “second-tier tech” They included Baidu a Chinese search engine and ViacomCBS an American media conglomerate with a streaming service that gives it the flavour of a faddish tech stock Their prices crashed under the weight of the selling The price of ViacomCBS shares for instance fell by more than a quarterBy Sunday March 28th it had emerged that the mystery client was Archegos More familiar names were caught up in the drama On Monday Credit Suisse said it was in the process of liquidating the positions of a client that had defaulted on margin calls and that the related losses would be “material” Unofficial estimates put these at $3bn-4bn Nomura a Japanese bank said that it was on the hook for about $2bn possibly more if stock prices fell further These are significant losses If not quite a lost limb they amount to more than a flesh wound The banks’ share prices tanked The full reckoning will only become clear over time But evidently Nomura and Credit Suisse were slower to pull the plug than their American rivals after an attempt to co-ordinate an orderly unwinding of Archegos positions failed By making the margin call on Archegos early and then liquidating positions quickly the Americans seem to have limited the damage to themselves but left the others nursing bigger mark-to-market losses The fire sale raises some disquieting questions How was Mr Hwang a little-known figure able to run up such big losses? Leverage played a big part Why then was he able to lean so heavily on Wall Street to enhance the size of his bets? What makes this even more puzzling is that Mr Hwang had already blotted his copybook In 2012 he pleaded guilty to charges of insider tradingOne answer is that banks are desperately searching for profits Rules drafted after the global financial crisis make it expensive for Wall Street banks to trade on their own account The days when they could make much money from slow-moving unleveraged asset managersthe “long-only” crowdare a distant memory Such investors mostly buy and sell stocks cheaply on electronic platforms So Wall Street banks increasingly rely on fees and commissions from fast-trading hedge funds or family offices that act like hedge funds such as Archegos Fees on bespoke derivatives such as equity swaps and contracts for difference are especially attractive to the brokerages The appeal for the fast-money hedge-fund crowd is that such derivatives allow them to magnify their positions They can make large bets without having to put up lots of their own capital upfront In short Wall Street can’t easily make money out of people who do not take rash bets But people who make rash bets can lose you money too It is probably not a coincidence that Credit Suisse and Nomura are based in countries Switzerland and Japan respectively where long-term interest rates have been stuck near or below zero With few opportunities to make money from lending at home they turned to Wall Street for excitement Unfortunately for their shareholders they found it Parallels are naturally being drawn between Archegos and LTCM an ill-fated hedge fund In 1998 LTCM was prevented from blowing up itself and the banking system by the Federal Reserve which co-ordinated a bail-out by its Wall Street brokers LTCM too was afforded breathtaking leverage by its brokers who were dazzled by its principal shareholders who included John Meriwether a star trader formerly at Salomon Brothers and Robert Merton and Myron Scholes Nobel-prizewinning economists It appears that several of the banks that acted as Mr Hwang brokers tried to come to a standstill agreement of the kind that the Fed mediated for LTCM in order to avoid a fire sale of the stocks they held to hedge their exposure to Archegos Those discussions are now the subject of regulatory scrutiny The tentacles of Archegos evidently do not stretch anything like as far into the financial system as LTCM The wider damage from the Archegos affair has so far been limitedArchegos might be a one-off mishap albeit a large one But it is not too much of a stretch to link it to some recent market themes Since November there has been a general shift away from tech-and-media stocks which profited greatly from the stay-at-home economy towards cyclical companies such as banks airlines and industrial firms which benefit from reopening Archegos may well have been at the wrong end of this at times violent rotation Events are moving unusually fast in the world economy and in financial markets And when events move fast some things get broken A version of this article was published online on March 29th 2021

across the EU government borrowing rose to nearly 10% of GDP in 2020 But America again did more notching up a budget deficit of 19% of GDP last year And borrowing will only drop a smidgen this year to about 15% thanks to the passage in March of another stimulus package of $19trn A new proposal to spend an additional $2trn on infrastructure may widen the deficit further though Joe Biden administration seeks to fund at least part of that initiative with new tax revenueEurope is hardly re-embracing austerity Budget rules intended to limit member states’ borrowing which were suspended last year will not be reimposed until at least 2023 Borrowing across member governments may thus reach about 5% of GDP this year Crucially the EU itself has fiscal firepower to wield now courtesy of the Next Generation EU fund agreed by member states last year and backed in a first by European bonds This pot of €750bn $880bn or about 6% of the EU GDP in 2020 will direct large sums of money towards recovery efforts and growth-boosting investments over the next five years Such spending is badly needed given Europe pitifully weak levels of investment in recent years While in America gross fixed capital formation grew by just under 1% a year in 2016-20 in Europe it shrank according to an analysis by Christian Odendahl and John Springford of the Centre for European Reform But current plans are simply far too modest The EU economy is currently about 20% smaller than it would have been had it expanded from 2008 onwards at the same pace it managed from 2000 to 2007 That is a gap in output of about €3trn American-style fiscal expansion is not without risks Critics warn that too much borrowing and spending could lead to worryingly high rates of inflation But Europe where inflation has been lower for longer would have comparatively little to fear from a similarly bold fiscal programme While some European economies carry unnervingly high debt loads the EU as a whole has a much lower level of debt to GDP than America Low interest rates are more firmly entrenched in Europe While America overnight interest rate rose as high as 24% before the pandemic Europe remained stuck at zero The yields on some European ten-year government bonds remain in negative territory And though Eurosceptic sentiment has receded in recent years existential threats to the EU could stage a swift and powerful return if a robust American recovery exposes the gratuitous nature of anaemic European growth Europe governments have done well to do better than they managed a decade ago Imagine what could be though if they were to do enough 
 Mar 27th 2021,The Fed and the bond markets,JEROME POWELL does not want you to misunderstand him The Chair of the Federal Reserve knows that communication is a big part of how monetary policy works Mr Powell speaks plainly He is not an economist but that probably helps because he is less likely to resort to confusing jargon His messages at the Fed press conference on March 17th were admirably clear: no change in the main policy settings; no change in Fed guidance about future shifts in policy; and no real concerns about jumpy government bond marketsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThat latter message might seem a little surprising The sharp and volatile rise in the yield on ten-year Treasuries since the start of 2021 has been routinely compared to the “taper tantrum” of 2013 when markets threw a fit in response to hints that the Fed would reduce or taper its bond purchases This year volatility has been construed by many investors as a challenge to the Fed Yet Mr Powell was unperturbed And why not? Looked at in the round the markets have been remarkably compliantThey will not always be so At some stage the Fed will shift gears and announce that it is going to taper Lessons have been learned from 2013 about how not to spook the markets But the idea of immaculate forward guidance by the Fed in which markets are never taken by surprise still seems fanciful A bond market capable of a taper-less tantrum is unlikely to deliver a tantrum-less taperIn one sense the rise in Treasury yields has been quite natural In the early stage of the business cycle as confidence in economic recovery builds investors start to demand greater compensation for holding long-term bonds The big upgrade to GDP growth forecasts this year merits a big rise in yields Expectations of inflation derived from bond prices are now almost rigidly in line with the Fed target of 2% on the personal consumption expenditures PCE indexIn this sense the market has been obedient Even the stockmarket is going Jay way After a surge in equity prices through last year the S&P 500 index has lost momentum There has been a lot of action within the index though Some of the froth on the more faddish stocks has been blown off Meanwhile the cheap-looking shares of “cyclical” companies which profit from economic recoveries have gone up in value If Mr Powell seems fine with all this it is understandable It is a validation of sortsBigger challenges lie ahead Mr Powell says that the preconditions for the Fed to raise interest ratesfull employment inflation moderately above 2% for a whileare some way off But before then the Fed will taper its bond-buying There will be an element of discretion to its decision to start When it comes it will mark a gear-change in monetary policy That alone will be unsettling Ideally the Fed would allow for longish pauses between its signal to taper the taper itself and the first interest-rate rise to allow markets to settleIt may not get the chance Everything in this economic cycle is happening at great speed That is in part a reflection of the scale of economic stimulus and not only from the Fed One big fiscal package seems set to follow another A $19trn package has barely passed and a $3trn infrastructure bill is mooted The Fed may be pushed to go through its paces faster than it would preferSpeedy policy shifts cause tantrums One reason to think the market might be touchier than normal is related to how far asset prices particularly of risky securities have risen given the business cycle is still young The housing market has recovered smartly Struggling firms that rushed to issue bonds in a frenzy last year are under less pressure than they normally would be to reduce their debts Spreads on risky corporate bonds are remarkably tight And America stockmarket is once again trading at a lofty multiple of earnings All of this increases the sensitivity of the economy to the Fed next policy shiftThat is probably not soon The Fed has bought itself some breathing room by insisting that the inflation that accompanies reopening over the next few months is likely to be prove transitory The message from Mr Powell is that he and his colleagues are not even talking about talking about tapering “Until we give you a signal you can assume we’re not there yet” he said But we might get there by the end of this year or early next year given how quickly things are moving Mr Powell signalling has been admirably clear so far But there will be plenty of scope for misunderstandings later on

 Mar 27th 2021,The economics of falling populations,BUBONIC PLAGUE killed between one and two thirds of Europeans when it struck in the 14th century Covid-19 mercifully has exacted nothing like that toll Its demographic impact however is likely to be significantly larger than the nearly 3m tragic deaths so far attributed to the coronavirus thanks to an associated worldwide baby bust Births fell by about 15% in China in 2020 for example while America recorded a 15% drop in monthly births between February and November of last year As a consequence the pandemic may have brought forward the projected date of peak global population by as much as a decadeinto the 2050s A shrinking planetary population might seem like a wholly welcome thing given the world environmental challenges But fewer people may also mean fewer new ideas yielding a very different sort of future than optimists tend to imagineListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKHumankind did not attain a population of 1bn until the 19th century but the total then grew rapidly A second billion was added by the 1920s and nearly six more in the hundred years since Plenty of fretting has accompanied this explosion; “The Population Bomb” a book by Paul Ehrlich published in 1968 between billions three and four warned of looming global famine Most projections before the pandemic however suggested that global population would plateau in the latter half of the 21st century Some analysts have argued that our numbers will not just stabilise but decline In “Empty Planet” a book published in 2019 Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson two Canadian journalists wrote that as fertility rates falla clear trend across rich and emerging economiesthey tend ultimately to sink below the replacement rate of 21 children per woman Nearly half the world people now live in countries with fertility rates below replacement levels Barring an unforeseen demographic detour global shrinkage loomsHow many people does it take to invent a light bulbMessrs Bricker and Ibbitson point to potentially positive consequences of a falling population such as reduced pressure on scarce resources a decline in environmental damage and increased autonomy for women although they also note there would be economic disruptions such as a scarcity of care workers and problems with the sustainability of government debt History also suggests population decline can be economically beneficial in some ways In the wake of the Black Death in the 14th century a scarcity of labour relative to available land and resources led to higher real wages and more freedom for workersYet a recent paper inspired by their book by Charles Jones an economist at Stanford University argues that over the long run any positive economic effects that come from a shrinking population may be cancelled out by the reduction in humankind creative capacity If ideas drive growth and people are the source of ideas he writes then the fate of our species depends crucially on long-run population trendsIn the absence of new ideas growth must eventually grind to a halt The adding of labour or resources or capital machinery and such to an economy can boost income but with diminishing returns; in the absence of technological progress ore becomes harder and costlier to mine and there are ever fewer valuable tasks to be done by an extra worker or industrial robot New ideas though allow an economy to do more with less or create new and valuable tasks to occupy labour and capital Technological progress has thus enabled steady growth in real income per person over the past two centuries even as global population has soaredBut new ideas must themselves be produced An economy can increase the flow of ideas by adjusting its use of human resources: by investing more in education and encouraging more people to work in research rather than production for instance But while these solutions sufficed to generate lots of new knowledge in the 20th century Mr Jones says they are themselves subject to diminishing returns The share of a population working in R&D can only rise so high for example and as it does the productivity of each additional researcher is likely to drop A decline in the absolute number of brains might thus place a serious dampener on innovation he writes and thus on prospects for continued growth in incomes Using a simple model Mr Jones suggests that the world may face two potential outcomes in future If fertility stabilises at a high enough level an “expanding cosmos” scenario awaits in which the stock of knowledge population and incomes all rise ever upward Alternatively a cycle of falling population and reduced idea creation could lead to an “empty planet” outcome in which living standards stagnate while population figures dwindleModels like Mr Jones are less interesting as literal descriptions of how economies work than as illustrations of how different factors might affect future economic developments It is possible for instance that computing advances might increase the productivity of research or even enable the automation of some forms of idea generation reducing the constraint he identifiesAt the same time his work gestures at underappreciated sources of complacency Rich economies may have worried too little about the growing numbers of researchers needed to generate steady improvement in computing power for instance out of a misguided assumption that there will always be more people available to don a lab coat They may also have undervalued human potential more generally: by failing to prioritise education or welfare programmes which might allow households that would like to have children to do so comfortably with the same urgency as they have looked after other critical resources Strangest of all in the eyes of future inhabitants of an emptying planet may be rich governments’ present disquiet at fast-growing populations in the developing world That advanced economies did not invest lavishly in the talents of the world poorer billions may come to look existentially foolhardy 
 Mar 25th 2021,America used to be behind on digital payments Not any more,JUST OVER a decade ago Patrick and John Collison founded Stripe a company in Silicon Valley that helped other tech startups accept online payments It has since outgrown them all On March 14th the firm said it had closed a fundraising round valuing it at $95bnthree times its valuation 11 months ago and enough to make it America biggest-ever unlisted firm Stripe is not the only company cashing in on the check-out business as the payments revolution finally takes off in AmericaListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt has been a while coming In 2018 Ant Financial China payments giant raised private funds at a valuation of $150bn It was common then to hear Chinese executives say that America land of the posted cheque and the hand-signed credit-card receipt was years behind held back by a cosy club of banks and credit-card firmsNow investors have decided the moment has come Take PayPal a digital-payments firm set up in 1999 to allow users of Palm Pilots a forebear of smartphones to “beam” each other money It was later bought by eBay an online marketplace which spun it out in 2015 for $45bn Today it is worth $275bn more than Citigroup or Wells Fargo It is also more valuable than Ant which has fallen out of favour with regulators in China and has been forced to cancel its initial public offeringEnthusiasm for digital-payments companies has been whetted by the pandemic The share price of PayPal has jumped 186% in the past 12 months while shares in Square an American rival have more than quintupled and those of Adyen based in Amsterdam have nearly tripled The digital boom is luring credit-card colossi and tech titans such as Visa and Google to online paymentsThe digital-payments industry is rather like a transport system “Acquirers” connect the shop app or website to the infrastructure and check details including a buyer identity or available funds to authorise travel The money then moves along the customer chosen type of “rail”: credit-card bank-to-bank or mobile-wallet systems run by distinct firms Then come the refreshment trolleysservice providers like buy-now-pay-later firms that purport to make the journey more pleasant Everyone takes a cut on the wayPart of the digital firms’ ascent reflects the fact that they have achieved scale PayPal combines an online wallet used by 350m consumers with a gateway accepted by 30m merchants That generates large network effects which the firm has sought to encourage further by crafting tie-ups with other firms like Mercado Libre a Latin American marketplace and UnionPay a Chinese credit-card scheme The company expects its users to double by 2025 Square which has targeted independent merchants and consumers under-served by conventional banks operates a similar model the chairman of The Economist parent company is a director of Square By contrast Adyen and Stripe are pure online acquirers with no consumer brand But their tech nous makes it fast and easy for businesses to set up online-payment platforms Stripe has long served smaller firms and Adyen big ones but they are converging Because verifying a customer identify and probity is hard especially when transactions are cross-border about 10-15% of online transactions are usually declined But the digital firms can reduce rejection rates by four to five percentage points In return they charge a decent fee: Stripe typically takes 27-29% of each transaction or 19% in Europe Now they can spread their costs over hundreds of billions of dollars of transfers the fee they earn on every extra payment is nearly all profit which they can reinvest Three trends are helping to propel the digital firms further One is the growth of e-commerce which has been turbo-charged by the pandemic The second trend is the dash away from cash in favour of digital payments which covid-19 has probably accelerated by three to five yearsA final factor comes from increasing market share within online payments Over half of digital-transaction volumes worldwide are still acquired by the captive sluggish arms of banks says Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson a research firm Since most lack global aspirations and e-commerce expertise market share is bound to migrate to the online giants Such trends also boost Visa and Mastercard the dominant card networks Yet they run only one type of rail whereas the four payment champions are mostly agnostic about which way the money travels And the established card firms are under attack from antitrust watchdogs who worry that they make it difficult for merchants to process transactions through cheaper alternatives On March 19th shares in Visa fell on reports that the Department of Justice was investigating itA bigger threat to the fintech quartet could come from giants in adjacent sectors Big-tech firms are starting to beef up their own payment apps Large retailers like Walmart and Target are building their own acquirers and wallets through which they could give rewards to loyal customersIn order to pre-empt the threat of competition the digital-payments firms are expanding their offerings PayPal has launched buy-now-pay-later cryptocurrency-trading and credit-card services On March 8th it said it would buy Curv a digital-asset-security firm; it bought Honey a coupon service last year It says it wants to become a “super-app” for financial services and in February told investors it expected to more than double its revenue to $50bn by 2025 Square peer-to-peer payment business Cash App has evolved into a digital bank enabling users to buy bitcoin trade stocks receive paycheques and use a debit card It now has 36m users up from 7m in late 2017 and brings in 45% of Square gross profit Stripe has started offering working capital and accounts to merchants in partnership with banksWith digital payments set to continue to surge the fantastic four have three or four years of clear runway before running head-on into each other predicts Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research an equity-research firm By then however they will probably have become entirely different firms with their own range of banking or software products That should give them even more room to roam as well as access to far bigger revenue pools It may have taken a while for digital payments to hit the big time in America and the West But better late than never A version of this

 Mar 25th 2021,Just how anchored are America inflation expectations?,SINCE DEMOCRATS proposed a $19trn fiscal stimulus in January hawks have warned that America economy might overheat With cheques for $1400 now landing in bank accounts President Joe Biden reportedly considering spending another $3trn on infrastructure and the Federal Reserve showing no sign of putting the brakes on the rebound from the pandemic the predictions of impending doom are getting louder The latest was delivered by Larry Summers a former treasury secretary on March 20th Mr Summers sees it as more likely than not that the economy will suffer either from an inflation surge or from the crushing effects of higher interest rates America he says has the least responsible economic policy in 40 yearsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe worst-case scenario painted by inflation hawks can be broken into stages First inflation will soon rise mechanically as numbers from the spring of 2020 when the economy and commodity prices slumped fall out of comparisons with a year earlier On that everyone agreesThe next phase is a second wave of inflation as spending by newly vaccinated consumers rebounds from the pandemic faster than production can keep up Even stimulus advocates typically admit that overheating is a risk and it would be more likely should more deficit spending pass Mr Biden may unveil the spending side of his infrastructure bill alongside his preliminary annual budget proposals for government departments which are due next week Whereas some of any Biden infrastructure bill may be paid for by raising taxes it seems unlikely that Congress would raise $3trn this way rather than relying on at least some extra borrowingIt is the last stage of the doomsday timeline that is most controversial in which temporary inflation turns permanent as the public inflation expectations rise and become self-fulfilling Workers anticipating a higher cost of living demand higher pay; forward-thinking firms raise prices The result would be a return to the 5% plus inflation of the late 1960s or perhaps even the 10%-plus rates of the 1970sIn recent decades the grip of the Fed on inflation expectations seemed ironclad Even when in 2019 unemployment plumbed depths not seen since the 1960s inflation expectations did not stir very much In theory that makes all inflation surprises temporary “Having [inflation expectations] anchored at 2% is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy really weak” said Jerome Powell the Fed chairman on March 17thBut how strong is the anchor? There are at least three types of inflation expectations: those priced into financial markets; those that appear in surveys of households and businesses; and those of professional forecasters Market expectations have been spooking hawks The ten-year bond yield has risen to about 17% up from 05% in early August However the inflation expectations incorporated in these yields remain broadly consistent with the Fed target The bigger problem is tail risk William Marshall of Goldman Sachs a bank calculates that the implied inflation risk premiumin effect the price of insuring against very high inflationhas risen The market-implied probability of average consumer-price inflation exceeding 3% per year for the next five years is over 30% according to the Minneapolis Fed That does not imply 1970s-style inflation but would be uncomfortable for the FedThe evidence suggests that survey expectations are more important than market prices Households’ inflation expectations have not budged much though consumers like investors have become less certain about the future see chart The danger is that the public is poorly informed and its expectations are therefore fickle Even firms do not seem to pay much attention to inflation nowadays When Olivier Coibion of the University of Texas and three co-authors surveyed top executives in April 2018 55% said that they did not know what inflation would be over the next year When they do have a view both firms and households chronically overestimate price rises Consumers seem unduly swayed by the price of petrol The authors concluded that the public expectations looked “anything but anchored”Professional forecasters can give Mr Powell most comfort They are nearly unanimous and unwavering in believing what the Fed says about the long term Yet their historical record as an early warning signal is not encouraging As the economy overheated in the late 1960s prognosticators were behind the curve according to the Livingston survey the best available record of their viewsPart of the explanation is that forecasting inflation is hard Even with today vastly improved methods after two years the consensus inflation forecast is on average off by 04 percentage points in one direction or another calculates Goldman Sachs Someone who forecasts that a central bank target will lose credibility before it happens can look unhinged Even Mr Summerswho does not suffer from excessive humilitycouches his predictions in probabilities which make it nearly impossible for him to be proved wrongJoseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute a think-tank says the Fed should promise “dramatically” higher interest rates if inflation rises and does not fall back Saying this too soon would knock confidence Arguably however the Fed is undermining the implicit understanding that it will tackle overheating by emphasising its duty to ensure a thriving jobs market that reduces inequality That makes it harder to imagine the central bank crushing inflation by engineering a recession as happened in the 1980s Should enough people doubt its hypothetical resolve the door to persistently higher inflationor to a painful credibility testwould be ajar See also: We are tracking the Biden administration progress in its first 100 daysA version of this article was published online on March 24th 2021
 Mar 25th 2021,Trade inflows in Asia fuel debate over currency intervention,IT MIGHT SEEM cause for celebration Taiwan was already a standout economic performer in a pandemic-plagued world and its good run fuelled by semiconductor sales is continuing Orders for its exports rose by an eye-watering 49% in the first two months of 2021 compared with a year earlier according to data released on March 22nd There is just one snag: export strength has become awkward for officials in Taipei for it attracts unwanted attention America Treasury has already placed Taiwan on its “monitoring list” for countries that manipulate their exchange rates and the boom only adds to the harsh glareListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf it is any solace to Taiwan it is far from alone in drawing such scrutiny Across Asia foreign-exchange reservesa good proxy for currency interventionhave jumped Excluding China where the data are trickier to interpret reserves in the next ten largest Asian economies increased by about $410bn last year the biggest annual jump on record according to calculations by The EconomistSome of the other countries are like Taiwan part of the Asian manufacturing complex which has benefited from resilient overseas demand for electronics and consumer goods amid covid-19 lockdowns In Vietnam for example exports grew by 65% last year With its currency the dong loosely pegged to the dollar much of those trade receipts wound their way into official foreign-exchange reserves the central bank issues dong to buy excess dollars from commercial banks at a quasi-fixed exchange rateOther countries recorded big net currency inflows in tougher circumstances In the Philippines and India exports slumped but imports fell more sharply Both countries swung from current-account deficits to large surpluses last yearThe controversial question is whether the build-up in reserves is from a global perspective bad The case against reserves is that since they stem from efforts to suppress currency appreciation they represent a beggar-thy-neighbour trade policy: boosting your exports at the expense of others Yet there is also a case for reserves For small open countries the goal may be to minimise disruptive exchange-rate swings not to keep a currency cheap And for developing countries reserves are a liquidity backstop if foreign capital dries up as it did for many last yearThat distinction matters in Asia It seems absurd to fault some of the poorer countries During the “taper tantrum” of 2013 when emerging markets sold off over fears of American monetary tightening India and Indonesia were among those seen as vulnerable because of their reliance on external financing Bigger buffers should make them more stable If they can wrestle the pandemic under control this year it is likely that their imports will rebound and their current-account surpluses will diminish The increase in their reserves would end up looking like a healthy aberration not a malign trendThe gains in richer countriesespecially China South Korea and Taiwanlook more objectionable They themselves seem to be aware of this Most notable is China which appears to have taken steps to conceal its good fortune Its central bank foreign reserves have risen by $97bn since the start of 2020 making for a relatively modest increase of 3% But there has been a marked jump in net foreign-currency assets in its banking system which are up by $133bn or 80% in the first nine months of 2020 see chart One possibility is that the commercial lenders have acted as proxies for managing reserves Currency traders in China say big state-owned banks have indeed been major buyers of dollars at moments of maximum yuan strengthThe best defence for these three countries is that they have wanted to check the speed at which their currencies appreciate particularly given the uncertainties of the pandemic Even with their bigger reserves the currencies of China South Korea and Taiwan are all up by about 5% against the dollar since mid-2020 They will face more upward pressure if the export boom continues The pandemic promises to leave a key oddity of the world economy intact: treasure chests of reserves in Asia that are accumulated held and spent in order to insulate economies from currency markets that policymakers don’t trustA version of this article was published online on March 23rd 2021
 Mar 20th 2021,Why two former central bankers are talking about trust,AFTER THE global financial crisis people asked whether economists had not misunderstood something important about markets The trying experience of recent years has some figures broadening the question to ask whether economists have not failed to grasp something crucial about people In a new book “Values” Mark Carney governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020 argues that within profit-obsessed market economies self-interest crowds out other motivations making the world a more selfish placeand potentially a less resilient and prosperous one too The notion is disconcerting not least because the dominance of orthodox economic thinking leaves leaders poorly equipped to assess and respond to such claimsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKParts of Mr Carney argument are echoed in another new book by Minouche Shafik director of the London School of Economics who served as one of Mr Carney deputies at the Bank of England Baroness Shafik book “What We Owe Each Other” examines the role of the social contract and considers how changes in the global economy have undermined the function of the institutions societies rely on to keep the world a reasonably just place Fixing up and modernising the social contract is necessary she writes “if we are not to witness a destructive fracturing of the mutual trust on which citizenship and society is based” People have become too disinterested in their obligations to other people and to society as a whole Baroness Shafik says; they owe each other moreSuch notions would not have been out of place in the work of the classical economists Indeed both Mr Carney and Baroness Shafik cite Adam Smith work “The Theory of Moral Sentiments” which investigated how people come by their values beliefs and preferences They do so Smith argued through “mutual sympathy”by imagining how others feel essentially This informs the public sense of right and wrong and establishes a social foundation for other institutions including markets Smith saw markets as “living institutions embedded in the culture practice traditions and trust of their day” writes Mr Carney Modern economists rarely write about markets in such terms The innovations of the neoclassical economists of the late 19th century shaped the profession into one in which utility value and market prices are all treated as more or less the same thing In an effort to become more rigorous or scientific economists stripped from their analysis the difficult moral questions that interested Smith Economics “simply doesn’t traffic in morality” writes Mr Carney quoting “Freakonomics” a popular economics bookBut if economists have lost interest in questions of morality and prefer instead to model worlds in which people act strictly in their own self-interest moral forces still matter for economics Baroness Shafik reckons that the solidarity that underpins social stability has a moral rationalethat it is wrong to deny people the ability to meet their basic needsas well as political and economic ones If the social contract breaks down and people do not adequately look after each other then crises of finance public health or the environment for example will threaten prosperityMr Carney for his part worries that market activity and market incentives crowd out important social norms Private vices like greed or ambition which can help raise social welfare when exercised within a perfectly competitive market are often socially destructive in other less ideal circumstances As money becomes the primary or sole measure of value society loses the ability to distinguish between acts of wealth creation that deserve to be heralded and those that do not People who pass up the opportunity to make money for other more selfless activities come to look more like suckers than model citizens The loss of interest in doing good for its own sake leaves society less able to meet serious crises like climate change Mr Carney himself worked at Goldman Sachs a bank early in his career and recently drew criticism for using dodgy methods to claim that the portfolio of the asset manager for which he now works emits net-zero carbonMr Carney provides some support for his argument Studies show that monetary incentives can crowd out pro-social motivations in ways that prove counterproductive In experiments for instance student groups paid to do charitable work contribute less to the community than those given only a motivational talk about serving a good cause But the events of the past year provide lots of corroborating detail in the struggles governments have faced persuading citizens to wear masks or be vaccinated and the human and economic costs that have followedMaximised futilityIt may seem strange that central bankerswho can be a dispassionate and humourless bunch even for economistsshould be among those to raise the alarm about the fraying of the social fabric But it makes a certain kind of sense As Mr Carney writes trust is central to maintaining the stability of a currency or a financial system Humourlessness itself can be a signal to the public a mark of seriousness meant to provide assurance that the money and the bank accounts in which people hold their savings can be relied upon Few public officials will be more aware of the risks from a breakdown in mutual trust and regard for others than those charged with fending off runs on the financial systemYet their writing illustrates just how difficult change will be Their solutionsto make capitalism more inclusive and shore up safety-netsare built around technocratic tweaks to policy not a moral awakening and understandably so The analytical tools relied upon by top economic policymakers do not include mechanisms for quantifying the importance of social norms or cultivating ethical behaviour across the population Indeed Mr Carney argument poses a fundamental dilemma: today powerful figures are those that thrived within the current system If society needs new moral leadership it may need to look somewhere else 
 Mar 20th 2021,Efforts to modernise economics teaching are gathering steam,ECONOMISTS ARE keen fans of dynamism but there are too few signs of it in economics teaching A survey of American lecturers last year found that their methods which rely on lectures and assigned textbook reading had barely changed in 25 years* Textbooks themselves can lag behind the practice of economics A study by Jane Ihrig of the Federal Reserve Board and Scott Wolla of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found that at least three of six leading texts published since the start of 2020 misrepresented monetary policy They say the Fed sets short-term interest rates by buying and selling securities But since 2008 the central bank has changed the rate it pays on banks’ reserves insteadListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKStudents say that inequality is the most pressing economic problem of the day according to a paper by Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute and Wendy Carlin of University College London But in many textbooks they argue the topic is merely appended to the core curriculum In 1993 a study found race and gender bias in introductory textbooks A quarter of a century on many are still found to underrepresent women The new survey did not consider race Some in the profession are now trying to shake up economics instructionThis is partly because improved pedagogy is being seen as a way to diversify the profession KimMarie McGoldrick who leads a committee on economics education for the American Economic Association AEA says that teaching used not to be a priority which may have sapped efforts to entice students into the subject Now the classroom is being seen as a place for a more active approachIn January the AEA supported a teacher-training conference meant to improve diversity among students and gather evidence on the impact of different teaching methods on different ethnicities genders and races It is also sharing best teaching practices Those include more student participation being open about biases in textbooks and encouraging teachers to replace “trivial or sexist” examples like “beer and sports cars” with weightier applications like inequality and climate changeTextbooks are evolving too Last year Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan published a tome that tries to avoid representation biases Its description of the mechanics of monetary policy also scores well In Britain a free book published by CORE a charity that Ms Carlin helps run has been adopted in 47 out of 60 economics-teaching universities The book starts with inequality rather than presenting it as an afterthoughtYet CORE has struggled to make headway in America That could reflect perceptions that it is left-wingor that it de-emphasises the simple supply-and-demand diagrams that professors like to teach or that it is too mathematically demanding Or perhaps the incumbents are doing something right as Gregory Mankiw the author of a best-selling introductory text suggested in a recent webinarBut barriers to change exist too Teachers not students pick the textbook for instance And though a free book might attract students it is teachers who bear the cost of switching as they have to revise their notes The trend towards online-learning platforms which bundle books with test banks and homework-marking software does not help The CORE team is developing a paid version of its books with such features for the American marketWhere professors have the freedom time and resources change is having positive results Students of a curriculum based on CORE in Australia seem to do better in follow-up courses A study by Ann Owen and Paul Hagstrom of Hamilton College found that using practical assignments as well as a curriculum covering “the broad range of social issues that economists study” led to women earning higher grades When Carina Krusell a student took the revamped course she was delighted to be able to replicate analysis that found discrimination against people with black-sounding names “The course made me realise oh this is economics” *Teaching methods in undergraduate introductory economics courses: results from a sixth national quinquennial survey” by Carlos Asarta Rebecca Chambers Cynthia Harter The American Economist March 2021

 Mar 18th 2021,America banks have too much cash,WHEN BOND markets seized up in the spring of 2020 the problem was a shortage of cash A global dash for dollars caused bond yields which move inversely to prices to spike It sent the greenback soaring in currency markets And it caused trading in Treasuries usually the world most liquid market almost to dry up Today the opposite problem looms: a surfeit of money It stems from the Federal Reserve response to last year crisis The central bank calmed markets by buying vast quantities of bonds with newly created cash and has continued its purchases at a current pace of at least $120bn a month The abundance of dollars is causing headaches for banks and investorsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKA central bank buying a bond for cash sounds like a simple swap of asset for asset In fact it often swells the banking system When the Fed buys assets in the secondary market say from a pension fund it cannot pay the fund with the electronic money it creates because only banks can hold these so-called “reserves” Instead the fund gets a newly created deposit at its bank and the bank gets the newly created reserve at the Fed The bank ends up bigger with a new liability and a new asset The same thing also happens when a bank buys freshly issued debt at a Treasury auction then sells it to the Fed When the government spends the funds it has raised such as by sending cheques to households or paying its staff the banking system growsWith both mechanisms at work in the pandemic the Fed assets and deposits at banks have shot up in tandem see chart The balance-sheet of JPMorgan Chase America biggest bank grew from $27trn to $34trn in 2020 as deposits rose by 35%Cash will keep pouring in Since last spring the Treasury has issued more debt than it has needed to fund its enormous emergency stimulus in 2020 As a result the “Treasury general account” TGAthe government current or checking account at the Fedgrew from about $350bn in early 2020 to about $13trn on March 11th But much of this money will soon be spent on President Biden new stimulus programme which includes cheques of $1400 to most Americans The Treasury has signalled that the TGA balance will fall to $500bn by the end of June And current law passed the last time America debt ceiling was lifted requires the balance to fall to about $120bn by August Any rundown in the account means still more deposits and reserves for banks in addition to those infused by the FedThe abundance of cash has two main effects The first is that it has caused interest rates in the federal-funds market in which banks lend reserves to one another overnight to drift down The Fed aims to keep the federal-funds rate between zero and 025% but it has been falling within the band and is now about 007% As banks have abundant reserves the federal-funds rate is economically insignificant But rates in secured lending or “repo” markets which matter much more to the real economy have been approaching negative territory too The benchmark secured-financing rate is just 001% One-month Treasury bills yield only 003% The second effect is that banks are left with a lower ratio of equity capital to assets making it harder to comply with minimum capital requirements set by regulators One rule is the “supplementary leverage ratio” SLR which requires big banks to fund themselves with equity worth at least 5% of their total assets In March 2020 regulators exempted both cash reserves and Treasuries from the SLR recognising that the Fed emergency actions by expanding bank assets had made it bind more tightly The exemption however expires at the end of MarchLeft unchecked both factors could cause markets to behave strangely If short-term interest rates go negative then supposedly safe money-market funds might be forced to “break the buck” returning to investors less than was put in Facing a change to the SLR banks might turn away new depositsa strategy JPMorgan floated in January The alternative raising expensive capital to fund holdings of low-yielding cash is unattractive The biggest worry concerns Treasury markets An easy way for a bank to shrink its balance-sheet quickly is by selling assets to investors Were a big bank or two to approach regulatory capital limits and start shunning Treasuries the market could go into a tailspin An early sign of this may have been in late February when amid a global bond-market sell-off an auction of seven-year Treasuries suffered record low demandWhat to do? To fight the downward drift in interest rates the Fed could marginally raise the rate it pays on reserves currently 01% though it declined to do so after its monetary-policy meeting ended on March 17th Regulators might soon extend the exemption of reserves from the SLR Jerome Powell the Fed chairman hinted that an announcement regarding the rule was imminent Extending the exemption however would be controversial On February 26th Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown two Democratic senators wrote to regulators urging them to restore the SLR “as quickly as possible” fearing that the pandemic was being used as an excuse to weaken reforms made after the global financial crisisIn any case renewing the SLR exemption will not solve the problem argues Zoltan Pozsar of Credit Suisse a bank A more binding constraint might be the extra capital requirements that so-called “globally systemically important” banks incur as they grow By the end of 2020 JPMorgan was on the cusp of seeing its SLR surcharge rise from 4% to 45% of risk-weighted assets creating another regulatory cliff-edge Other big banks face constraints too: Wells Fargo America third-largest bank has had its total assets capped since 2018 as punishment for a mis-selling scandalThe inadequacy of the SLR exemption may explain why the Fed has expanded another of its programmes The “overnight reverse-repo facility” allows investors to park cash overnight at the central bank in exchange for Treasuries At its meeting the Fed lifted the maximum exchange with each counterparty from $30bn to $80bn If investors park more money at the central bank directly then banks’ balance-sheets should shrink The facility is barely being used but the Fed says Mr Pozsar is “foaming the runway”The usual worry about letting investors have direct access to a central bank balance-sheet is that it disintermediates the banks and by providing a new haven for cash makes bank runs easier Today though draining banks of liquidity might be precisely what is needed for financial stabilitythe latest example of the mind-bending monetary economics brought about by the pandemic 
 Mar 18th 2021,China markets are shaking off their casino reputation,IN A WORLD where internet memes can explain market swings China is second to none Early in March with mainland equities down by 15% in two weekstheir steepest fall in yearsa video circulated on Weibo a microblogging site of a sheep stuck in a fence on a hill and a hiker climbing up to free it The description of the video in its meme incarnation was “the national team comes to rescue me” The national team is shorthand for big state firms that are believed to stabilise the market by buying shares when they plungeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThis video though had a twist The hiker frees the sheep only for it to lose its footing and tumble down the hill Talk of the national team rescue mission had spread for a few days but equities continued to tumble wiping out all gains made since late last yearAt last on March 9th the national team really did arrive State media reported that large state-owned insurers had bought stocks Coincidentally or not that heralded the market bottom For casual observers of Chinese finance it all fit a familiar pattern: stocks careening from boom to bust propelled by day traders and rumours and the government eventually restoring calmBut to those inside the market the story was in fact more novel The decline in Chinese shares neatly paralleled the decline in the NASDAQ America tech-heavy stock index Guan Qingyou a prominent Chinese economist argued that the underlying trigger was nervousness about inflation in America A resulting jump in American bond yields had sparked risk aversion globally and hit China hard Foreign investors who had helped fuel China equity rally last year retreated Reacting to the same signals big domestic fund managers also rushed to pare their holdingsThe sell-off in other words furnished evidence about two important areas of progress in China capital markets: they are both more professional and more interwoven with global finance than before At the same time incessant talk about the national team was a reminder of the idiosyncrasies of finance in a state-dominated economyidiosyncrasies that matter ever more to the rest of the worldJust five years ago no analysis of finance in China was complete without a detailed look at shadow banking Formal banks were too strictly controlled to satisfy borrowing needs in the fast-growing economy Stock and bond markets were underdeveloped So between the cracks lightly regulated institutions cropped up willing to lend to anyone with collateralespecially property developers and minersBanks despite their conservative exterior had a big hand in shadow financing They got around caps on deposit rates by funnelling savings into opaque “wealth-management products” a chunk of which flowed through the shadow firms Some of these products offered yields of over 10% Yet they enjoyed informal guarantees from the state-owned banks making investors think that they were as safe as deposits The shadow-banking industry grew to 285% of banks’ total assets in 2016Around that time a series of messy defaults alerted regulators to the dangers They began a campaign to unwind the shadow financing They forced trust companies to hold more capital They stopped banks from offering guarantees on wealth products And they opened the door to a new professional fund industry pressing banks to launch formal wealth-management subsidiaries rather like asset-management groups in developed marketsBanks are barred from investing in equities but the new divisions face no such rules They cannot however offer guarantees Contracts specify that in a downturn investors will face losses Some banks’ wealth units manage their own funds; others team up with outside managers Much of the money flows into the stockmarketThe ubiquity of mobile payments has given ordinary people another route to funds With a few taps users of Alipay or WeChat Pay can choose from hundreds of products China 100m or so retail punters have long believed that they can beat professional investors But that sentiment has shifted over the past two years and many are now buying into mutual funds at record pace says Desiree Wang of JPMorgan Asset Management Much as retail investors have been vocal on social media about the performance of individual stocks they now debate laud and criticise the performance of the country top fund managers Funds are also becoming more sophisticated Since the global financial crisis a stream of Chinese nationals has returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai from London and New York bringing a new set of skills says Louis Luo of Aberdeen Standard Investments an asset manager Funds once limited to plain-vanilla active management have brought in specialists to launch quantitative and absolute-return fundsThese trends have been magnified at China big mutual funds Three of the largest mutual-fund companiesChina Asset Management E-Fund and Southern Asset Managementhave each surpassed 1trn yuan in assets under management The rate of growth at mutual funds and at the banks’ wealth-management arms is projected to take professionally managed assets in China from around 96trn yuan $147trn in 2020 to 244trn yuan in 2029 or near the current size of the asset-management industry in AmericaPart of that is a hedge-fund industry with Chinese characteristics Regulators forbid the short-selling of individual stocks But scores of big investment managers have emerged with portfolios that encompass global and domestic assets as well as private and public markets Operations at China hedge funds are increasingly similar to those in global financial centres says Gokul Laroia of Morgan Stanley a bank The biggest is Hillhouse Capital Management run by Zhang Lei with about $70bn under management Some are based offshore with a focus on China like Himalaya Capital run in Seattle by Li Lu once seen as a potential successor to Warren Buffett Investors in China pay close attention to their decisions When it was revealed last year that Mr Li had upped his stake in Postal Savings Bank of China scores followed his lead Shares in the bank long derided as a stodgy state lender have doubled in price since OctoberHello worldProfessional fund management is now approaching a tipping point Retail investors still make up about 80% of average daily trading volume in the stockmarket; in America even with the much ballyhooed rise in day trading they account for just about a quarter Yet institutional investors’ holdings as a share of China market capitalisation have increased from 30% in 2012 to about 50% At this pace says an executive at a Chinese asset manager institutions’ share of daily trading volume could hit 50% in the next five years For foreign firms the professionalisation of the markets could present an opening Nothing in China comes easily thoughFor years many officials in China feared that wily Western “wolves” would gobble up the banking market But Xu Zhong a senior banking official observed in 2019 that the problem was in fact the opposite “We are not open enough” he said This hindered development; competition was needed to help local firms improve He added a rhetorical flourish of the kind that wins debates in Beijing: the lack of opening goes against President Xi Jinping doctrine that China must be confident in its system China he concluded should be bolder Mr Xu line of reasoning has so far prevailed There are two separate but related openings that are now drawing Chinese and global finance more closely together The first is the opening of China capital markets to foreign investors Funds allocated to China have risen rapidly since 2018 The inclusion of many onshore stocks into global indices such as MSCI flagship emerging-markets index has led to tens of billions of dollars in passive fund allocation a year There has also been a rush into the country sovereign and policy-bank bonds a tempting alternative to ultra-low-yielding bonds elsewhereThere is still tremendous scope for growth In the onshore stockmarket foreigners hold nearly 5% of Chinese shares; by comparison foreigners own about 25% of American shares Foreigners own just 3% of Chinese bonds versus about 30% of the American market and are overwhelmingly concentrated in government bonds Corporate debt is still seen as too murkyOne obvious concern for foreign investors is whether they can get their money into and crucially out of China Doing so is now easier Hong Kong stock-connect programme which allows trading in Chinese stocks has fuelled a 40-fold increase in daily cross-border trading volumes in China since 2015 Repatriating profits through a qualified institutional-investor scheme used to take up to six months Now it takes a few days The real test will come if markets crash as they did in 2015 Then the government made it hard for foreigners to take funds out of the countryThe second dimension of China opening is to foreign institutions Investment banks long touted China potential yet were granted only glacial increases in their onshore presence Things are speeding up thanks in no small part to the deterioration in relations between America and China Wall Street banks the thinking in Beijing goes are powerful lobbyists in Washington Goldman Sachs which set up its joint venture in China in 2004 is applying to take over 100% of its onshore investment bank A number of other foreign banks including Morgan Stanley and UBS are expanding their domestic businessesThe optimistic case is that these investments will in time pay dividends The oft-repeated line from foreign financiers is that China is a long-term strategic project When SMIC a semiconductor group listed in Shanghai in July it raised $66bn the largest offering in China since 2010 “That really got people wanting to do more work on initial public offerings IPOs and look beyond just secondary trading” says Christina Ma head of greater China equities at Goldman Sachs To be a full-service investment bank a patchwork of licences is needed: for wealth management underwriting and trading to name a few Some firms are putting them together The disadvantages of being a foreign operator in the Chinese market are disappearing says Eugene Qian the chairman of UBS SecuritiesThe pessimistic view is that China is and always will be the market of the future The head of a foreign bank in Shanghai describes China regulatory demands as a “purity test” To obtain licences to operate banks must have teams of underwriters and risk officers in place all with the right qualifications That drives up staffing costs before any revenue is earned Vanguard an American asset manager recently halted plans to launch its own mutual-fund unit in China citing the time it would take to build up a

entangled in a dispute over Huawei a Chinese telecoms giant Banks will need to be skilful at managing both their relations with China government and their portfolios to stand any chance of successThe giant IPO of Ant a fintech group would have been a monument to the power of China capital markets Instead it became a monument to the power of its government Officials halted it in November less than 48 hours before trading was due to begin in Shanghai and Hong Kong Heavy-handed regulatory actions are the most obvious way in which the state exercises control over markets But there are also two more subtle points of influenceFirst even as the government has pulled back from day-to-day economic management state-run firms cast a shadow over everyday business State-owned investment banks may be less capable than foreign upstarts But most big firms that turn to the capital markets know to give most of their business to state playersThe state is also an investment force to be reckoned with Government-guided funds which channel cash to companies in priority sectors such as chipmaking have amassed about 9trn yuan in capital and are growing quickly according to China Venture a research firm “If they choose to compete in a certain area you know you can’t outbid them” says the head of a big private Chinese investment companySecond the state sets rigid parameters around its markets This is felt most acutely in foreign-exchange trading because of China careful management of the yuan Though it is now easier for investors to move money across borders they still face a host of rules once in China If foreign firms for example do well trading equities they typically must take their profits out of the country before reallocating money to bonds Moreover there are few currency-hedging tools in the onshore market a hindrance for big investors Offshore hedging is possible but expensiveA stately mannerOver the past few months the strength of currency inflows into Chinavia both its trade surplus and inbound financial investmentsimplied that the yuan should have appreciated strongly The head of a currency desk at a foreign bank in Shanghai says the central bank acting through proxies appeared to restrain it “Whenever the yuan rose to 645 [against the dollar] big Chinese banks came in to stop it” he says Without an open capital account all prices in China markets end up skewed Stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen trade at a premium of roughly 30% over stocks in the same companies listed in Hong KongFew dare to go against the state The China head of a global hedge fund reports that one unusual aspect of the mainland is that securities regulators conduct random inspections turning up without warning and demanding answers to probing questions “They would only do that in New York if you’re under arrest” he saysYet the controls around China markets can exert a pull of their own Whereas China trails America in the size of its stock and bond markets it is by one measure ahead in commodity futures The number of contracts traded last year on its main exchanges in Dalian Shanghai and Zhengzhou was six times higher than on America CME Group exchanges In terms of value they were roughly equivalentIt is not just that China has the biggest appetite for commodities from copper to iron ore It is also home to some of the world most liquid commodity exchanges Smaller contract sizes make it easier for small companies to get involved in trading And the very limits that Chinese investors face on investing offshore make commodity exchanges attractive “There may be more contracts on foreign exchanges but not many have truly excellent liquidity In China most contracts are liquid giving investors lots of opportunities” says Sunny Fang of Orient Futures one of China biggest futures brokeragesCommodity futures also show how China markets shape global markets Last April the price of oil futures in America collapsed below zero as demand evaporated and storage filled up In China though futures stayed at around $30 a barrel with investors lapping them up That attracted shipments to China and helped restore global oil prices to a more normal level“The information from Chinese futures is very clear This is what the world biggest consumers are paying for commodities” says John Browning of Bands Financial a Shanghai-based futures brokerage Whether in China or Texas oil is oil and prices should convergeThe information from China stock and bond markets is more abstract It tells you about the health and direction of the economyno small thing given China weight in the world Yet interpreting it is not simple Portfolio managers at Chinese investment groups have learned Western-style stock analysis but they also understand the Chinese regulatory

 Mar 13th 2021,China government is cracking down on fintech What does it want?,FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES “cause turmoil when loosed” yet “perish once regulated” a deputy governor of China central bank observed last year This is an apt description of the dilemma facing the country regulators Innovation has swept its financial markets over the past decade It has produced some of the world most valuable technology companies such as Ant Group and in some cases such as peer-to-peer P2P lending led to fraud and losses Regulators have fintech in their sights But what is it they hope to achieve?Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThe rise of fintech in China has been unmatched elsewhere Cash has vanished from cities replaced by mobile and QR-code payments Tech groups processed 210trn yuan $32trn in payments in the first nine months of 2020 twice the amount in 2016 Consumers often manage wealth products or buy insurance on their phones; borrowing to shop on virtual malls has never been easier Tech firms helped broker trillions of yuan in micro-loans last yearThat rapid growth far outstripped regulatory capacity Much of the oversight fell to provincial watchdogs that were simply outgunned A former mayor of Chongqing complained that Ant used the jurisdiction to securitise 3bn yuan in loans many times over to raise more than 300bn yuan Beijing vice-mayor said in November that its finance bureau had 70 staff policing 70000 firms The central-bank official wrangling with the dilemma admitted that regulation had “malfunctioned”The state is rectifying that Its efforts can have drastic results Just look at P2P lending where widespread fraud and billion-dollar scandals drew regulators’ attention in 2016 The sector has been largely wiped out Outstanding loans from nearly 7000 platforms fell from about 1trn yuan in May 2018 to half that by 2019 see chart According to regulators all platforms had closed down by November last year Losses have devastated some households The campaign has gone on to target other forms of internet-enabled finance Its culmination has been an attack on Ant Regulators halted its $37bn initial public offering IPO two days before its launch in November 2020 and published draft rules targeting Ant lucrative micro-lending business An estimated $100bn has been wiped off the $310bn valuation it fetched ahead of its listing Ant and its founder Jack Ma have been held up as bad actors Gavekal Dragonomics a consultancy concluded after the death of the IPO that China “frontier era for fintech is now over” On March 12th Simon Hu Ant chief executive became the latest senior employee to leave the firmThe final rules published in February take effect next year In contrast with P2P they do not seek to crush the fintech giants Instead the state has three main aims for fintech next phase The first is to control tech-linked leverage The revelation in its prospectus in July that Ant had facilitated some 173trn yuan in loans off its balance-sheet but on banks’ was a warning to regulators The model copied by other tech firms incentivises the companies to broker micro-loans for a fee Yet they face almost no risk if borrowers fail to repayThe new rules will make Ant and other mobile lenders look more like banks by making them provide the funds for at least 30% of the loans they make As of June Ant had put up only 2% of the capital in its micro-loans business which had kept its cost of capital low and limited its exposure to bad debt Banks will be allowed to write no more than 50% of their loans through fintech partners and must limit such lending to 25% of their tier-1 capital This will force tech firms to work with a few big banksAnt itself is transforming its freewheeling fintech operations into a financial holding company The central bank has said it wants the firm to “return to its roots” That could mean Ant businesses outside of payments such as insurance wealth management and consumer lending will come under fireThe state second aim is to control data Many of the tech groups operate vast networks of servicesfrom shopping and ride-hailing to food delivery and health servicesthat collect dozens of data points from hundreds of millions of users every day It is these data that help them derive rich credit appraisals for loans The central bank is strong-arming tech firms into sharing this valuable information in the hope of building a central databaseThe attempt to rein in leverage and break up data monopolies has met with praise from several quarters “There is indeed an urgent need for upgrading the regulatory framework” says Chi Lo ofBNP Paribas Asset Management Even a prominent tech investor says the tech giants had “abused their market power” and that it was time they faced scrutinyAnt data-modelling largely held up even through the worst of China economic contraction during the early outbreak of covid-19 says an adviser who has seen its loan-performance data But the wider micro-lending boom has failed says an executive of a large fintech firm in China Credit-hungry borrowers have built up debts across platforms often leaving lenders in the dark A central scoring system will come at the expense of Ant and Tencent which have the most user data But for smaller tech groups it will be a boonThe state third objective to play a more active role in fintech is more controversial Without help from tech companies banks’ consumer lending is bound to hover around 22% of their balance-sheets the dismal industry average for the past decade reckons BNP Simply handing over data to the government is not enough to boost lending says a consultant who works with the tech firms The data lose their value when separated from the network of daily interactions hosted by the tech companies The task for regulators is therefore to keep banks and tech firms connected The interactions will be monitored more closely by regulators Banks’ reporting standards for tech-linked lending have already become stricterSeveral cities have launched regulatory “sandboxes” to test new technologies before they are deployed widely The state looks set to dominate these Banks have launched most of the 60 projects in the sandboxes notes Plenum a consultancy with many large state lenders involvedMoreover the central bank is testing a digital currency The so-called “eCNY” is expected to give the state more control over payments and a better view of cashflows throughout the economy No internet platform could raise billions of yuan without alerting the authorities The currency could disrupt mobile-payments operators such as Ant and Tencentit is even being designed to be used offline giving the government an edge over the fintech firms The state hopes that designing its own financial technologies will cause less havoc Private-sector firms may disagree Editor's note March 12th 2021: This article has been updated since publication
 Mar 13th 2021,How America blockbuster stimulus affects the dollar,HERE IS THE tale of the dollar so far in 2021 It came into the year on a declining trend A lot of people were mildly chary of its prospects The gist was that people had bought a lot of dollars last year They might wish to sell some There has since been a dramatic upward revision to forecasts for GDP growth in America This has been mirrored in sharply rising Treasury yields Growth upgrades; higher interest rates; both are good for currencies The result has been a stronger dollarListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIt is not sufficient for a strong dollar that America does well; others must also be doing badly “If the US economy grows incredibly fast and nowhere else does the dollar will go up” is how Kit Juckes of Société Générale a bank puts it The question is: can it keep going up and for how long? The dollar usually provokes strong feelings in the currency fraternity It is either loved or hated That is not the case now which is remarkable There may be a strong-dollar story But there is no really strong story about the dollarTo understand why consider first the important drivers of currency moves: trade flows relative interest rates and risk appetite Trade flows track the underlying demand for a currency If domestic interest rates rise relative to foreign ones that attracts speculative capital inwards supporting a currency Shifts in risk appetite can overwhelm these fundamentals Indeed that was the story in 2020 Last March when suddenly the priority was to have cash the cash that people wanted was dollars The DXY index a weighted average of the dollar exchange rate against six other widely traded currencies rose sharply in mid-March as covid-19 panicked markets The Federal Reserve responded by opening swap lines with other central banks to ease the dollar shortage Then over the rest of the year the dollar declined as risk appetite revivedThe greenback bounce-back this year is more about interest-rate differentials Here the story gets a little frayed The interest rates that you would normally think of as mattering for speculative currency flows are short-term rates But central banks are not for moving those soon So bond yields have become a signifier since they in part reflect the as-yet-distant tremors of moves in future short-term rates Bond yields in turn are responding to growth expectations The dollar responds by moving higherAfter all what currency would you swap it forthe euro? America economy is roaring back while much of euro-land remains closed and the distribution of vaccines has been how to put it charitably? sluggish You can make a case that the Federal Reserve will have to tighten monetary policy sooner than it thinks But the European Central Bank looks set to keep interest rates near zero indefinitely The same goes for the Bank of Japan Britain vaccination programme has been a success which helps explain the rising pound But Britain remains locked down and its economy is still suffering Rising crude prices have pushed up the currencies of big oil producers such as Canada and Norway But beyond these there are few currencies you might prefer over the greenbackThe dollar seems likely to rise a bit further in the near term “There are a lot of stale short-dollar positions” says George Papamarkakis of North Asset Management a hedge fund Speculators who have a bearish view of the dollar have already sold it short If the currency keeps rising they may be forced to buy it back Another factor in the dollar favour is that risk appetite is less ravenous than it was Equity markets are choppy The dollar might be the least-worst place to sit out the volatility And if the financial markets suffer a full-scale tantrum the greenback could benefit from a flight to safetyLater in the year though there is a case for a mildly weaker dollar A big part of that story is that a booming American economy will lead to a wider trade deficit: strong demand in America will spur activity elsewhere Asia is already doing well Europe is lagging but will enjoy an upswing once vaccination rates pick up Risk-taking would then revive “When the US is doing well and also bringing the world with it there are more interesting places for investors to put their money” says Mr JuckesAs the days grow longer 2021 might start to look less like early 2018 when a faster pace of interest-rate increases in America drove up the dollar and more like 2017 a year of broad global growth and a falling dollar The story of the greenback in 2021 could yet have a twistDig deeperJoe Biden stimulus is a high-stakes gamble for America and the world Mar 2021The world consumers are sitting on piles of cash Will they spend it?

 Mar 13th 2021,The perils of asking central banks to do too much,THE PARLIAMENTARY act that chartered the Bank of England in 1694 begins by describing the motivation of its authors “to promote the publick Good and Benefit of our People” Ideas about how best the bank can serve the publick have changed a bit over the centuries from managing the market for government debt to maintaining the value of sterling against gold to in recent decades keeping inflation in the region of 2% On March 3rd its mandate received another tweak when Rishi Sunak the chancellor declared that it should conduct policy with an eye towards environmental sustainability The adjustment is just one example of a wider phenomenon in which central banks are told to accept or themselves take on tasks beyond the standard monetary ambit The mission creep is enabled by a sense that central banks can and should do more given their firepower and competence compared with some other government officials But tempting as it is to allow authority to flow to those who use it well adding to central-bank mandates poses both economic and political risksListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThough central banks have been around for ages the idea that they should operate at a remove from meddling politicians is a fairly recent one stemming from the experience of high inflation in the 1960s and 1970s Economists worried that governments could not commit themselves to keeping inflation low since they would be tempted to use an unexpected burst of monetary expansion to deliver a short-run jobs boomeven though this would ultimately leave inflation higher while employment fell back to a more sustainable level By delegating control over the money supply to central banks governments freed themselves from temptation and opened the door to lower inflation and a less volatile business cycle From the 1970s to the 1990s most rich-world central banks were told to focus on price stability alongside full employment in some cases as with the Federal Reserve and were granted some measure of independence to do the job Lately however the relationship between central banks and governments has grown complicated To manage the global financial crisis and the covid-19 pandemic central banks intervened in a range of financial markets in some cases buying corporate bonds and equities To stimulate economies and keep markets functioning they hoovered up massive amounts of government bonds an action that could be confused for the monetary financing of public debt At the same time their struggles to revive inflation have turned some monetary officials into vocal advocates for fiscal stimulusquite a reversal from past practice The boundary between the fiscal and monetary spheres once so clear has blurred That central bankers like Christine Lagarde of the European Central Bank ECB and Jerome Powell of the Federal Reserve are more politically polished than some of their more bookish predecessors further muddies the pictureAs all this has occurred both governments and central bankers have also taken a more expansive view of the latter mission Many central banks were handed new financial-stability responsibilities after the financial crisis Now another rethink seems to be under way Last month the Reserve Bank of New Zealand was instructed by the government to take account of house prices when setting monetary policy Some monetary officials are paying more attention to inequality and the welfare of marginal workers The Fed recently revised its policy framework partly in recognition of the fact that premature tightening tends to impose disproportionate harm on black and Latino workers Climate change has become a hot topic In January Ms Lagarde said the ECB was assessing how it might contribute to European climate goals Mark Carney a former governor of the Bank of England was also vocal on the matter of climate change As a consequence of Mr Sunak announcement the bank will adjust its corporate-bond-purchase scheme so as not to subsidise firms with large climate footprintsSome of this new expansion of horizons is defensible Where climate change poses financial-stability risks by threatening systemically important insurers say central banks are right to take note Had the Fed worried more about joblessness early in the 2010s it might have been less eager to tighten monetary policyand more likely to hit its inflation target But where they were once granted independence because governments could not help but inflate central banks now plead for more government spending to help reflate depressed economies Meanwhile central banks’ insulation from politics makes them a convenient place to delegate jobs that elected officials would rather not handle Politicians seem as though they’re ducking their responsibilitiesand in the process make central banks seem like political actors The ambiguous and occasionally conflicting nature of tacked-on goals encourages a view of central bankers as multi-tasking dilettantes rather than stolid guardians of the currencyYou had one jobTo shift state power beyond the scope of democratic accountability is no small thing If runaway inflation is less inevitable than once feared then the independent central bank may appear to have outlived its usefulness But perhaps not Should America new willingness to pass fiscal stimulus prove a sign of things to come then a credible promise to halt unacceptably high inflation by raising interest rates may still be essential By keeping inflation expectations anchored a central bank could limit the inflationary effects of stimulus and perhaps also discourage fiscal excess Credibility depends however on the perception that central banks can indeed act independently Expanding their remit to include policy issues like climate change or housing affordability not only places even more responsibility beyond the arena of democratic accountability It also blurs the boundaries between governing and central banking There are better ways to serve the publick Good

If they were to spend it all in one go rich-world GDP growth would probably exceed 10% in 2021 a figure so heady it would put the post-war recovery to shame It would probably also generate a surge in inflation At the other extreme households could spend none of their savings perhaps if they anticipated that their tax payments would eventually have to rise in order to pay for the enormous stimulus packages The reality will be somewhere in between Research by JPMorgan Chase a bank suggests that in many rich countries consumption will soon rebound to near its pre-pandemic level powering a strong global recovery Goldman Sachs another bank reckons that in America the spending of excess savings will add two percentage points to GDP growth in the year after full reopening That points to a fairly rapid recovery in both output and employment On March 9th the OECD a rich-country think-tank upgraded its forecast for GDP growth for the G20 group of countries to 62% in 2021 arguing that household savings represented “pent-up demand”Such calculations are highly uncertain however and not only because there are few precedents apart from the second world war Two factors matter: how the accumulated pots of cash are distributed across households; and whether people treat those pots as income or as wealthTake distribution first There seems little doubt that in all rich countries wealthier people have accumulated most of the excess savings They have been the least likely to lose work A big share of their spending is discretionary say on holidays or meals out; and it is many of these services that have been shut down during the pandemic A large chunk of savings in the hands of the rich limits the potential for a post-lockdown spending bonanza because the evidence suggests they have a lower propensity to spend what they earnYet the pro-rich skew in savings varies across countries In many low-income folk will not have any excess savings to spend even once lockdowns end During the pandemic the poorest quarter of European households have been half as likely to increase their savings as the richest In Britain the worst-off fifth say they have saved less during the pandemic than before The poorest Canadians have failed to build any nest-eggs in that time America looks different Its fiscal stimulus has been unusually generous A third round of cheques for $1400 will soon be sent to most adults Top-ups to unemployment benefits have ensured that many people who lost work have earned more from the state than they did in their jobs The result is that low-income Americans may have saved even more than the rich relative to their incomes A new study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that in late December the poorest Americans’ bank balances were some 40% higher than the year before compared with about 25% higher for the richest see chart 2 The poorest half have seen their liquid assets rise in value by 11% in the past year nearly twice the increase for the richest 1% Low- and moderate-income earners are more likely to spend their savings once the economy reopens fuelling the recovery There is greater uncertainty around the second factor influencing the recovery: whether households perceive their cash piles as income or wealth This is not merely a semantic distinction Many studies find that households are more likely to boost spending in response to an increase in income say a pay rise than they are for an increase in their wealth say a rise in the value of their house Households have built up excess savings in different ways in different countries Those in Britain and the euro zone have done so by spending less People are unlikely to treat this as “additional income” argued Gertjan Vlieghe a member of the Bank of England monetary policy committee in a recent speech In America and Japan by contrast excess savings are a result of higher income because of stimulus payouts not spending cutbacks In that situation Mr Vlieghe said excess saving “can more reasonably be interpreted as ‘additional income’” which consumers may be happier to spendAnd that points to a striking contrast with the post-war boom America recovery was impressive enough but Europe was even more so with GDP growth running 50% faster throughout the 1950s This time is different As the pandemic wanes it is America where more stimulus is in place and where consumers are likelier to spend it that seems set to leave the rest of the rich world in its dust Dig deeperJoe Biden stimulus is a high-stakes gamble for America and the world Mar 2021The world consumers are sitting on piles of cash Will they spend it?

Specialist firms have indeed sprung up offering to pay suppliers up front then cashing in their customer cheque as the bill comes due weeks later By charging fees or a spread the intermediary takes a cut for what is in effect a loan But the woes this week of Greensill Capital a provider of such supply-chain financing highlight some of the risks lurking in overlooked bits of the financial systemListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKGreensill founded just ten years ago boasted it could help companies “unlock capital” Using techniques mastered by erstwhile slicers-and-dicers of subprime mortgages it transformed the bills it took on into bond-like investments These could be sold to outside investors such as hedge funds desperate to find some yield in a low-interest world As long as the customers kept settling their invoices a tidy profit could be made for investorsand the financiers behind all the alchemy By 2019 Greensill claimed to have arranged financing worth more than $140bn to over 10m customersQuestions over whether the money would indeed keep flowing were never far away As concerns mounted over the creditworthiness of the companies Greensill had to collect money from the value of the bonds underpinned by the invoices wobbled On March 1st Credit Suisse froze $10bn of funds stuffed with paper sourced by Greensill The Swiss investment bank warned of “considerable uncertainties” with respect to the valuation of the bonds linked to GreensillWithin days Greensill itself was fighting off bankruptcy The firm is said to have sought relief from insolvent-trading laws in Australia where part of its corporate set-up is based its founder Lex Greensill is Australian By March 3rd it was reported by the Financial Times to be preparing to file for insolvency in Britain where it conducts much of its business Apollo Global Management an American private-equity giant has been in talks to buy at least part of the franchise at a fraction of the $7bn value Greensill which had planned to list its shares once hoped to achieveThe swift downfall of a once-lauded financial firm will reverberate beyond the niche world of trade finance Greensill had worked up a profile as a scrappy innovator while also courting the establishment David Cameron a former British prime minister was flaunted as an adviser Mr Greensill who said the idea for the business came from seeing his farmer parents run into financial difficulty and who is now in his 40s became a youngish billionaire After a previous sticky patch in 2018 the firm had received $15bn in investment from SoftBank a Japanese investment group fond of backing wildly ambitious undertakingsRegulators are now wondering whether the model highlights risks they ought to have fretted about On March 2nd BaFin Germany financial watchdog took over control of a bank Greensill runs there closing it to new business It has filed a criminal complaint against the bank management accusing it of manipulating its balance-sheet Greensill says it followed its auditors’ advice and was complying with the regulator previous requestsAnother concern is what will happen to companies that used Greensill services to access capital One noteworthy borrower is Sanjeev Gupta an Indian-born industrialist who has snapped up steelmaking assets in Britain and beyond Greensill was a big provider of finance to the GFG Alliance a group of firms controlled by Mr Gupta family; Mr Gupta also once owned a stake in Greensill itself It was transactions linked to loans to Mr Gupta empire which has not been accused of wrongdoing that prompted BaFin to step in A spokesman for GFG said it had adequate funding even as reports emerged of talks to secure loans from other sourcesThe episode will also shine a light on the world of supply-chain financing Fans of the practice point out it keeps money flowing even as some cash-strapped businesses keep suppliers waiting for months to be paid But its accounting treatment is tricky There is evidence that some struggling businesses may seek to hide spiralling debt piles by using supply-chain-finance techniques Creative forms of financing work best when they rely on conservative accounting 
 Mar 6th 2021,Why people are worried about the bond-equity relationship,MOST PEOPLE have little time for quants They find the language of quantitative finance far from illuminating Even fairly numerate people struggle to grasp what comes easily to pointy-headed number-crunchers Take the idea of correlation the co-movement of two or more variables Such relationships vary with the period over which they are measured The direction can shift Things quickly become confusingListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKYet the quant argot is useful when considering perhaps the biggest fear stalking financial markets: a sustained rise in inflation that would be bad for both equities and bonds A quant might describe this as a flip in the bond-equity correlation from negative to positive That is none too elegant though A better choice is a term used in geopolitics as well as econometrics: regime change It is helpful in this matter to start with two stylised facts The first is that in recent years bond and equity prices have tended to move in opposite directions over the business cycle When recessions hit bond prices tend to rise sharply their yields fall and equity prices usually crash When the economy recovers bonds tend to fall in price and equity prices go up again You can think of this in terms of risk appetite Government bonds are safe assets People rush into them when they fear for the future Equities by contrast are risky assets so people shun them in troubled times The second stylised fact concerns a secular relationship rather than a cyclical one Since the early 1980s bond and equity prices have moved in the same broad directionupwards If you look at low-frequency data over a long period the bond-equity correlation is positive This is best understood in terms of yields rather than prices For the past four decades there has been a secular decline in government-bond yields reflecting a secular decline in interest rates The earnings yield on equities has fallen too as have yields on other assets such as corporate bonds and property This should not be a surprise Yields are a gauge of expected returns Bonds and equities compete for investors’ capital Over the long haul the prices and yields of each will respond to those of the other These two facts may seem at odds but a third fact makes them consistent In each business cycle interest rates tend to rise as the economy gathers strength so bonds and equities diverge over short periods But each business-cycle peak in interest rates is lower than the previous one so bonds and equity prices converge over the long run That in turn is a response to the secular decline in inflationIndeed inflation is central to the bond-equity relationship It is here that things become trickier and the notion of regime change matters Bonds promise fixed cash payments in the future Those cashflows are worth less when inflation unexpectedly rises By contrast equities have generally outpaced inflation over the long haul But the relationship between inflation and equity prices is not stable A study by Sushil Wadhwani a former member of the Bank of England rate-setting committee in 2013 found that higher inflation generally helped to boost stockmarket returns in Britain in the two centuries before 1914 But by the last half of the 20th century a negative relationship had emerged You might best explain this finding in terms of monetary regimes Under the pre-1914 gold standard inflation was mean-reverting: if it was high one year it would fall the next But in the era of fiat money especially in the 1970s the checks on inflation were less bindingIn the past few decades central banks were given inflation targets and the monetary regime switched again Now yet another regime change may be afoot Fiscal stimulus is back in favour which has an unsettling 1970s feel to it Fiscal policy fell out of fashion because it was not well suited to fine-tuning aggregate demand; politicians are reluctant to cut spending or raise taxes when the economy threatens to overheat And the old-style central bankerreared in academia aloof from politics paranoid about inflationis now almost extinct The new breed talks about climate change and inequality and is sanguine about inflation risks This feeds a general sense of lost policy discipline Sooner or later warn the hawks this will end in tears Many of the people who predict the return of 1970s-style inflation used to deride the old-school bookish rate-setter with his fancy econometrics and lack of market smarts It is no small irony that they now feel so nostalgic for the pointy-headed central banker

One way to identify future casualties is to look at the characteristics of past victims Back in 2013 Indonesia was one of an unfortunate group of emerging markets dubbed the “fragile five” by James Lord of Morgan Stanley a bank The group which also included Brazil India South Africa and Turkey were all struggling with inflationary pressure an overvalued exchange rate and a conspicuous current-account deficit which measures a country trade deficit among other things A few months into the tantrum Indonesia reported that its deficit had increased to 44% of GDP The “market went into shock” Mr Basri recallsSimilar factors were combined into a “vulnerability index” by the Fed own economists in 2014 For the most part the worse a country scored on the index the more its currency fell in the taper tantrum This kind of evidence has prompted Fed officials ever since to argue that the sensitivity of emerging markets to the Fed words and deeds depends a lot on economic fundamentals in the emerging markets themselves To the Fed critics that can sound like blaming the victim But it is also a hopeful message It implies that emerging markets have some control of their own fates They are not “purely passive objects of the effects of Fed policy decisions” as Mr Bernanke put it in 2015 Mr Basri has recounted the numerous measures he and other policymakers introduced to make Indonesia less fragile They narrowed the country current-account deficit by raising interest rates tightening credit regulations and cutting fuel subsidies despite the political damage that would ensue Cabinet discussions were very “dynamic” Mr Basri writes Indeed judged by the criteria of 2013 emerging markets today look far less fragile than they once were Inflation is lower only 14% in Indonesia and “exchange-rate valuations have cheapened up considerably” says Mr Lord Their current accounts are also “much improved” Indonesia is now in surplus as are India and South AfricaThese past indicators of fragility however may not be appropriate for 2021 The pandemic has depressed demand and curtailed imports which has temporarily narrowed current-account deficits around the world But the fight against covid-19 has also dramatically widened another kind of deficit: the gap between government spending and revenues Budget deficits averaged over 10% of GDP across the fragile five last year according to the IMF Fiscal sustainability “has become the key macro area of concern for some emerging markets” Mr Lord saysBond strategists at HSBC a bank published an alternative ranking of vulnerable emerging economies on March 2nd The least resilient according to their scorecard are Brazil Indonesia Mexico and South Africa These economies have all been prone to current-account deficits in recent years even if the pandemic has flattered the latest figures And sizeable government debt in South Africa and especially Brazil leaves them exposed to any jump in interest rates which are now unusually lowThe fairweather fourThese are not the only potential sources of vulnerability When American yields rise and the dollar strengthens countries that have borrowed heavily in hard currencies find their debts harder to bear But the trouble need not end there according to Valentina Bruno of the American University in Washington DC and Hyun Song Shin of the Bank for International Settlements BIS Any deterioration in the creditworthiness of one borrower in an international lender portfolio can limit the risks it is willing to take on other emerging markets even those that mostly borrow in their own currency Boris Hofmann and Taejin Park of the BIS have shown that a rising dollar is a particular danger to emerging markets that have sold a large share of their bonds to foreigners One reason why Mexico is on HSBC worry list and Turkey is not is that foreigners hold 46% of Mexico local-currency government bonds and less than 7% of TurkeyThese findings create a headache for conscientious finance ministers in emerging markets If they strive to reform their economies to make them less fragile they will become more attractive to foreign investors who will then snap up a greater share of their bonds But that could make them more vulnerable to a sell-off whenever global financial conditions darken Indonesia reforms after the taper tantrum soon won praise from the IMF and attracted foreign buyers back to its bond market But Mr Basri admits these inflows increased the vulnerability of Indonesia economy to a reversal when global markets wobbled again in 2015 Emerging economies are not powerless victims of the Fed But they can be hapless victims of their own success 
 Mar 2nd 2021,Might the pandemic pave the way for a universal basic income?,WHEN ANDREW YANG began his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination his proposal for a “Freedom Dividend”monthly cash payments of $1000 to be paid to all Americansdistinguished him among a crowded field as an outsider and an unorthodox thinker Nearly two years later as Mr Yang leads the race for mayor of New York City his plan to provide cash to half a million New Yorkers feels far less radical and not just because it is much more modest than his idea for a national universal basic income UBIListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKThough UBI still meets with scepticism in many quarters the experience of the pandemic and the accompanying explosion in social spending have changed the tone of discussions about radical reforms to welfare states see article Cash transferslike those deployed by many governments during the pandemichave come to look like an efficient effective way to meet any number of social needs Few schemes during the pandemic offered recurring payments to all Yet though the age of the UBI has not dawned the ordeal of covid-19 could have brought it closer Arguments for universal-income payments have flourished for centuries Thomas Paine argued that the Earth is common property and everyone who makes use of its land and resources owes society a “ground rent” which should fund the payment of a “natural inheritance” to all adults Plans for universal payments and the subtly different idea of a guaranteed minimum income were a recurring feature of welfare debates in the 20th century Yet by the end of the century concerns about freeloading and persistently high rates of joblessness across much of Europe led to reforms that made benefits stingier or more contingent on workWorries about inequality and the beliefespecially among tech typesthat robots and artificial intelligence might soon make many workers redundant led to renewed interest in basic incomes in the 2010s But realistic proposals were scant Mr Yang plucky presidential bid notwithstanding In 2016 a Swiss referendum on a plan to pay all adults an income of about $2500 per month was soundly rejected with nearly 80% of voters opposedThen came covid-19 Restrictions on activity placed huge swathes of society in a position of dire urgent economic need Governments around the world responded with a fire hose of cash From mid-March to mid-June more than 11bn people received cash payments much of which were approved with little political opposition Cash transfers accounted for about a third of all pandemic-related social policies according to the World Bank America Congress passed a covid-relief act in March 2020 containing a provision to send no-strings-attached cheques of up to $1200 to most adults by near-unanimous margins another round of cheques followed at the end of the yearResidents of Hong Kong received payments worth nearly $1300; those in Japan about $930; most Singaporean adults roughly $425 Some governments experimented with payments that could be used only locally through vouchers as in Malta or pre-loaded debit cards as in parts of South Korea But most simply sent cashFew if any of these schemes offered a true UBI though In the rich world most cash-relief programmes were one-off transfers aimed at stimulating consumption and cushioning against income shocks In poor countries transfers more closely resembled a basic income in that they were often recurrent But most were aimed at the poor and vulnerable In its biggest-ever welfare programme the Brazilian government provided monthly payments to the poorest third of the population until December 2020 Togo scheme sends fortnightly transfers to the mobile wallets of informal workers where lockdowns are in placeBut as the end of the acute phase of the pandemic draws near and normal economic activity slowly resumes the number of programmes still in place is dwindling Only 7% of policies have been extended; the average scheme lasted just three months according to the World Bank In America President Joe Biden stimulus bill which is working its way through Congress makes provision for a third round of cheques though fewer people will receive them than in 2020 Pandemic assistance itself will not evolve into sustained basic-income schemes But the world experience with covid-19 could still make their eventual adoption more likely Polling suggests that young people in both America and Europe support UBI Both Democrats and some Republicans have expressed support for an expanded child tax credit in America which would provide cash with no strings attached to families on low incomes Though benefits phase out for those on high incomes the plan which is part of Mr Biden relief bill comes close to providing a basic income to families with childrenIn South Korea a presidential election contest scheduled for next year is shaping up to be a referendum of sorts on UBI Lee Jae-myung a potential candidate who as governor of the province of Gyeonggi oversaw a regional basic-income programme suggests that South Korea should adopt a national-level UBI of 500000 won $430 per year rising eventually to that same amount per month A possible rival for the presidency Chung Sye-kyun the current prime minister opposes the planPandemic experience also adds to a growing body of evidence on the effects of cash-transfer programmes In response to the surge in interest in UBI researchers and governments around the world launched a variety of experiments at least some of which had begun to yield results before the arrival of covid-19 Finland for example conducted a trial in 2017-18 in which 2000 randomly selected unemployed people were paid a modest income each month roughly equivalent in size to unemployment benefits which was guaranteed for the term of the trialEvidence from the experiment was muddied by a change to a law in 2018 which tightened conditionality for receiving unemployment benefits Even so the results are intriguing Among the biggest worries relating to UBI is the possibility that it might discourage recipients from seeking paid work Yet participants who received unconditional payments actually worked more than those on the dole Reported well-being was substantially higher; recipients also registered less depression and stress a higher degree of confidence in their abilities and more social trust than did those in the control group The Finnish results are broadly consistent with findings from other experiments Rebecca Hasdell then of the Basic Income Lab at Stanford University conducted a review of 16 basic-income studies published between 2009 and 2019 that covered rich and poor countries The research provides consistent evidence of a positive effect on educational attainment and on measures of physical and mental health and reduced poverty Effects on labour-market participation are generally small; half of the studies that assess its impact do not find a statistically significant effect Most of the rest find a positive effect she writesWhere participation does decline though it is often associated with an increase in caregiving which could worsen gender inequality in the labour market In low- and middle-income countries increased caregiving is often linked to lower workforce participation by women In some studies a basic income also seems to reduce participation by older workersIn some cases the beneficial effects of UBI seem to have persisted through the pandemic A team of economists that had begun a large-scale UBI experiment in Kenya before the outbreak of covid-19 was able to monitor its performance during the crisis Recipients reported levels of well-being that were modestly but meaningfully higher than those of the control group Effects on health outcomes were ambiguous But people receiving payments were more likely to engage in risk-taking commercial activities: perhaps the authors suggest because of the insurance provided by the transfers That suggests that even if basic incomes discourage some sorts of work they may encourage other desirable activities such as entrepreneurshipExtrapolating from these findings is a fraught business Studies of long-established systems with UBI-like features such as Alaska Permanent Fund which invests oil revenues and distributes dividends to the public also indicate that the employment effects of a universal payment seem to be small and may well be positive But conclusions drawn from programmes that are limited in geographical or temporal scope may not fully capture the ways in which a large-scale permanent UBI could affect society Norms regarding work and leisure might adjust in ways that alter the response to paymentsfor good or illReality chequeBehaviour could shift as more members of society receive generous income payments: perhaps because of a “social multiplier effect” which reflects the fact that some activities become more enjoyable as more people engage in them That is UBI recipients in say the Finnish experiment might have been more inclined to seek work because being in work is more attractive and not being in work less so when most people are employeda dynamic that could potentially change were income payments to become universalStill encouraging results from UBI trials are likely to encourage more experimentation They may also provide support to principles and policies that share features with a UBI without going the whole hog such as: universality; a relaxed approach to the question of work incentives; or a guaranteed income to some groups as Mr Yang now proposes That is because the most daunting obstacle to fully fledged UBI programmes remains: the little matter of funding Mr Yang original proposal for a UBI for instance would have cost about 14% of GDP a year though the price tag could be partly reduced by rationalising other welfare schemes For comparison overall federal spending amounted to 21% of GDP in 2019 Neither short-term UBI trials nor mass cash transfers in response to covid-19 required governments to take on the difficult task of financing enormous new expansions to the welfare stateMuch of the aid provided to households over the past year has been financed with new government borrowing up to and including Mr Biden proposals As accommodating as markets have been of government borrowing over the past year it seems unlikely that UBI dreams can be made real without the question of financing eventually being asked and answeredSome politicians are beginning to grapple with the issue Mr Lee reckons that a small UBI in South Korea could be paid for by adjusting the existing budget but he allows that increasing the generosity of payments would require additional money Taxes on land carbon emissions and digital services are his preferred funding mechanisms Mr Yang for his part argues that a combination of curbs to spending inefficiencies and philanthropic donations could pay for his proposed cash transfers which would cover only the poorest New Yorkers But where the great welfare-state expansions of the mid-20th century were enabled by a spirit of solidarity and self-sacrifice forged in depression and war which made tax-financing of new benefits politically possible the new enthusiasm for cash transfers owes more to a broad-based relaxation in concern about government borrowing As the pandemic ends that relaxed attitude may change as well among some segments of the political spectrum at least Only then can you learn how far along the path to a UBI the pandemic has actually moved society 
 Mar 1st 2021,Get ready for more bond-market scares,THE WEEK in financial markets got off to a breezy start belying the turmoil of the previous week By the time the New York market closed on March 1st the S&P 500 index of leading shares had risen by a carefree 25% on the day Europe stockmarkets had already followed Asia lead in closing sharply up The mood in Asia was helped by Australia central bank which acted to calm bond-market nerves by announcing it would intervene to buy long-dated government paper Yields on ten-year Aussie bonds which had risen quickly since New Year Day fell by some 025 percentage pointsListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKStockmarkets gave up Monday gains on Tuesday and Wednesday But conditions in America government-bond market were somewhat calmer in stark contrast to the week before when anxiety about inflation took hold The steady fall in bond prices since the start of the year had suddenly quickened to a pace that threatened a destabilising rout During February 25th the benchmark ten-year Treasury yield spiked above 16% bond yields move inversely to prices That is still low by historical standards but a lot higher than it started the day or indeed the year This prompted a big one-day fall in the S&P 500 and a bigger fall in the tech-heavy NASDAQ Almost as suddenly the worst fears about inflation have receded againbut perhaps not for longMuch of what has happened is to be expected Bond prices ought to fall as the economy recovers The ten-year Treasury is the benchmark bond and is thus a barometer of risk appetite in markets and of economic confidence more broadly And it is global benchmark The sharp rise in Treasury yields from the start of the year until February 25th was matched by yields on bonds in other places see chart 1Bond prices move in the opposite direction to confidence; bond yields go in the same direction as confidence When the outlook for the economy is bleak as it was in March last year yields fall sharply as investors rush to the safety of bonds As the outlook brightens bond prices start to fall and yields start to rise again Bond prices are thus countercyclical most of the time This feature makes them very attractive diversifiers for equities the prices of which are more procyclical moving up and down in tandem with the economic cycle see articleMild inflation is not to be feared Indeed it is in part changes in the market expectations of inflation that drive bond yields down in recessions and up in recoveries But hopes for a reflation of the economy can quickly spill over into fear of higher inflation The case for this seems stronger than it has for many years The American economy is recovering quickly Fiscal transfers have left households with lots of extra savings Lockdowns have given rise to pent-up demand Already there is plenty of fuel for a spending spree when the economy reopens in earnest And more is on the way President Biden $19trn stimulus package is likely to become law this month A jump in the annual inflation rate seems assured in the coming months if only because prices were depressed a year ago Perhaps then the strength of consumer spending as people start to move around more freely might further push it upThese latent anxieties form the backdrop to the recent turmoil Three factors in particular seemed to be at work First the market for future short-term rates started to price in interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve by early 2023 sooner than the Fed had indicated thus far You can call this the inflation-fear element: if the economy seemingly has this much momentum behind it can the Fed really hold off from raising rates for very long? And if it tightens sooner might the peak in interest rates be higher? That would be a big concern for America stockmarkets where high prices relative to future earnings are largely justified by the expectation that interest rates will remain very low for a long timeSecond just as the market was having a rethink about Fed policy the Treasury held auctions for two-year five-year and seven-year bond issues on February 25th These are maturities that are sensitive to shifts in expectations about Fed policy in 2023-24 Indeed the one-day rise in the five-year-bond yield was notable see chart 2 The auctions went poorly The seven-year bond had the lowest bid-to-cover ratio a gauge of excess demand for an issue of its kind for more than a decade This further spooked the market about the underlying demand for bondsThird the volatility in the bond market seems to have caused liquidity to dry up So for a given volume of selling prices fell further than they otherwise might have Each of these three factors reinforced the otherhence the dramaGiven the anxieties about inflation you may wonder why the bond market recovered its poise There are probably limits to how far an inflation scare can run this early in the economic recovery The message from the Fed rate-setters has generally been that they are not even thinking about thinking about raising rates or cutting back on bond purchases In a speech on March 2nd Lael Brainard a Fed governor stuck to that script “Today the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation and it will take some time to achieve substantial further progress” she said The intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia is a reminder that central banks have the firepower to cap bond yields if they are determined to do so And some private-sector investors will see value in Treasuries at these yields Foreign buyers from Europe and Japan for instance where yields are lower may find them attractiveAll this has restored a measure of calm to the bond market Ten-year Treasury yields are inching upwards again having fallen back to 14% The equity market is choppy but that might be expected after such a long run-up in prices You could put the events of last week down to “technical issues” the catch-all explanation for many a financial-market scare But that would be a little too sanguine Episodes in which trading liquidity suddenly dries up seem to be becoming more frequent in the Treasury market These sorts of scares will recur Inflation is the bogeyman of financial markets A whole constellation of expensive assets depends on its quiescence No one can yet be confident that it will stay subdued Further bouts of bond-market jitters are likely before the year is out

 Feb 27th 2021,Why the sacking of Petrobras boss spooked markets,THE PRESIDENT of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro likes to call his University of Chicago-educated economy minister Paulo Guedes his “Posto Ipiranga” a chain of full-service petrol stations The nickname charmed markets during the election campaign in 2018 but Mr Guedes reform agenda has lost ground to populist moves aimed at winning re-election When on February 19th Mr Bolsonaro fired Roberto Castello Branco the boss of Petrobras to appease lorry drivers upset about rising fuel prices markets saw it as a sign of more meddling to come The state-run oil firm share price dropped by 21% wiping 100bn reais $18bn off its market value Brazil benchmark stock index fell by 5% and the real lost 24% against the dollar all have since recovered some of the lossesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKWhat is unusual is not that Mr Bolsonaro intervened but how he did so With the oil price rising the real falling and an election approaching in 2022 “no government could resist the populist temptation” says a former executive of Petrobras which has had 16 bosses in 30 years But Mr Bolsonaro fired Mr Castello Branco a friend of Mr Guedes on Facebook without consulting Petrobras board To fans gathered outside the presidential palace he mocked Mr Castello Branco for working from home during the pandemic and echoed a nationalist slogan: “Is petroleum ours or does it belong to a small group of investors?”Mr Bolsonaro has paid lip-service to the need for reforms to stabilise public debt which is nearing 100% of GDP but the former army captain and back-bench congressman never fully embraced a liberal agenda Tax and public-sector reforms have stalled Now with inflation rising and the pandemic still crimping growth and employment “the pendulum has swung in a more interventionist direction” says Mário Mesquita of Itaú a bank The army general tapped to run Petrobras may stop short of price controls in part because of new rules that protect minority shareholders introduced after a corruption scandal and excessive intervention under Dilma Rousseff a former president But the firm plans to sell off unprofitable assets will suffer from greater uncertaintySo will the Brazilian economy as a whole Markets are getting less tolerant of Mr Bolsonaro heavy-handedness says Ana Carla Abrão of Oliver Wyman a consultancy On February 25th Congress will start voting on a constitutional amendment that would allow it both to bypass a spending ceiling in order to finance a new round of emergency payments for poor workers and to enact measures to curb the growth of spending such as by freezing public-sector salaries Both are necessary but politicians may approve the spending without the savings delaying reforms to an elusive future date That would increase the chances already high that the central bank raises interest rates next month for the first time since 2015Mr Guedes silence amid the turmoil suggests that he is holding on to hope that Congress which recently elected allies of Mr Bolsonaro as heads of its two chambers will pass the fiscal measures and slimmed-down versions of tax and public-sector reforms He may reckon that ambitious reforms can follow Mr Bolsonaro re-election That thinking seems wishful Still says Chris Garman of Eurasia Group another consultancy just as Mr Bolsonaro underestimated the cost of firing Mr Castello Branco those who think Mr Guedes will be next underestimate the strength of their relationship “Our Posto Ipiranga is irreplaceable” Mr Bolsonaro said in November The problem is that the lights are out service has been suspended and Brazil economy is sputtering 
 Feb 25th 2021,The pandemic has pushed working mums out of the labour force,LAST SPRING when covid-19 first began to spread in America employment sank like a stone The number of 25- to 54-year-olds in work shrank by 13% between January and April 2020 By January this year it was still 5% lower than a year ago with larger falls among low-income and black households The effect on women has been disproportionate too Millions have left the labour force altogether And American women have fared worse than those in other rich countries The drop in their participation rate relative to the male rate is one of the biggest among the members of the OECD a club of mostly rich countriesListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn January last year there were more 25- to 54-year-old or “prime-age” men than women in employment in America Had job losses been spread evenly across those groups around 300000 more men than women would have lost work over the year In fact the number of women in employment fell by around 220000 more than the number of men did That is in contrast to the pattern in previous recessionsThere are two potential reasons why working women have fared especially badly during the pandemic The first is because they are concentrated in the services industries most affected by pandemic-related restrictions The second is because they are more likely to have to care for children According to a survey of mothers who used formal child-care arrangements in January 2020 conducted by the Bipartisan Policy Centre a think-tank 42% of child-care centres used by respondents were closed in December 2020 21% were open but were restricting hours and 23% were limiting places A forthcoming study by Simeon Djankov Penny Goldberg and Eva Zhang of the Peterson Institute for International Economics another think-tank and Marie Hyland of the World Bank examines 44 economies and finds that there is a correlation across countries between employment patterns and the gender gap in participation during the pandemic Covid-19 seems to have had its most unequal effect in places where more women work in the services sector and where part-time workers have fewer legal protectionsIn America though it appears that the impact of gendered jobs has been surprisingly small Analysis by The Economist of the Current Population Survey suggests that women distribution across different industries may explain only a small part of the gender difference in job losses about 50000 jobs compared with a scenario where men and women were divvied up evenly across industries Although women are slightly overrepresented in leisure and hospitality where employment fell by 24% their presence in the health sector which went relatively unscathed has offered some protection So too has the fact that relatively few of them work in manufacturing which has been hit harderMore obvious are the burdens of child care which have detached women from the workforce altogether The share of women participating in the labour force ie either in work or looking for a job fell by 22 percentage points in the year to January 2021 or 06 percentage points more than for men But it fell by more than four percentage points among prime-age mothers whose youngest child was aged between two and six about three percentage points more than fathers of similarly aged children see chart Analysis by Ernie Tedeschi of Evercore ISI a consultancy found that school closures in September were associated with 16m fewer mothers participating in the labour marketDelve deeper into the figures and it becomes clear that gender inequality is interacting with America racial inequality By January the gender gap in the hit to employment rates of prime-age white people had closed whereas the difference was still a yawning two percentage points for black men and women One survey by Catalyst a charity that promotes gender equality in the workplace found that even if in-person classroom instruction resumed only 25% of black and 42% of Latino mothers would send their children to school compared with 59% of white mothers That could be because the schools are more likely to be in covid-19 hotspots or because they are worried about receiving proper care if they fall illAs the economy recovers many women will return to work Figures from the Household Pulse Survey suggest that in January 9% of women aged between 25 and 54 were not working because covid-19 led their employer to shut up shop; almost 3% said they weren’t working because they had covid-19 symptoms themselves Once vaccines and jobs become more plentiful they should be able to return But the danger is that the women who have left the workforce and have been out of it for some time find it harder to returnfurther entrenching existing inequalities

A social finance could simply be one in which the social transmission of information has an important effect on markets’ toings and froings In a paper written with Bing Han of the University of Toronto and Johan Walden of the University of California Berkeley Mr Hirshleifer suggests for example that shifts in norms regarding the open discussion of trading successes could affect which sorts of strategies spread and how That in turn might influence the appetite for risk across the market as a whole Financial professionals would not be surprised to learn that social transmission of information is important; the need to be close to the buzz of informal market chatter is one reason why financial-sector activity tends to be concentrated in hubs like London and New York Yet social connections could serve as more than just conduits for shop talk Indeed one person decision to make a particular investment could cause those around him to become more likely to follow suit Investors following others’ lead could do so because they have learned something from their peers about a particular asset You might take the plunge into cryptocurrency for example after discovering that it exists and hearing about its mechanics from a friend Peer effects may also reflect a desire to “keep up with the Joneses”: either to demonstrate that you are as financially savvy as other people in your social circle or to avoid the embarrassment of missing out on financial gains that your peers have been clever enough to grab Research by Patrick Bayer and James Roberts of Duke University and Kyle Mangum of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve turns up evidence of this sort of “investment contagion” during America housing boom Analysing data from the Los Angeles metropolitan area the authors find that residents became 8% more likely to take up property investment within the year for every neighbour living within a tenth of a mile who invested in housing But someone might also wish to invest in the same thing as others because of the opportunity for “joint consumption” say Leonardo Bursztyn of the University of Chicago Florian Ederer of Yale University Bruno Ferman of the São Paulo School of Economics and Noam Yuchtman of the London School of Economics That is a person may derive enjoyment from an investment because it creates opportunities to talk about the investment with others and revel in the shared experience That certainly helps explain why hobbyists of various sortslike baseball-card collectors and Pokémon enthusiastsmight become involved in speculation Swapping cards or gabbing about price movements is simply another way to bond with others over a shared pursuit The rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has likewise been enabled by tight-knit communities whose members share interests and see participation in the crypto world as a part of their identityBetter togetherAs the GameStop episode showed trading as a fun group activity has spilled over into the staid world of company stocks helped along by growth in retail-trading platforms and social networks The video-game retailer shares jumped from around $40 to $400 in a fortnight on virtually no newspowered in part by the activity of online communities like the WallStreetBets forum on Reddit a social-media site For many of the people sharing information about their bets and cheering each other on financial gains or losses seemed secondary to the sheer joy of being part of the group Investing became a consumption experienceNot everyone may have felt it was worth the price of admission though particularly after GameStop shares sank back to Earth An increasingly social finance raises thorny questions for policymakers How easy should it be for novices to join in the financial-market equivalent of a flash mob? How should the financial power wielded by social-media influencers be regulated? Does the rise of investment as a mass social activity pursued for kicks as much as for financial gain threaten markets’ ability to direct money to productive ends? Yet it is also worth remembering that traders and markets have always been social beasts A small fortune spent on an encrypted video of a cat may be less a sign of worrying change than a window onto how finance has always worked 
 Feb 24th 2021,Why Cathie Wood is the fund manager of the moment,CATHIE WOOD founder of Ark Investment Management provokes a variety of responses The main one is envy Her firm has been wildly successful Ark manages a suite of exchange-traded funds ETFs portfolios of equities around the theme of “disruption” Last year its flagship Ark Innovation ETF posted returns of 152% It is now the largest actively managed equity ETF in the world Ms Wood is the investment manager of the momentListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKFund flows follow performance Ark funds under management have ballooned to $60bn Much of the commentary around Ms Wood firm is around the difficulty of putting so much capital to work in Ark narrow categories while sustaining bumper returns When you charge 75 cents for every $100 you manage though this is a nice problem to have That Ms Wood has to wrestle with it is a mark of a singular success She has found a way of selling an important conceptthe extreme skewness of stockmarket returnsto a mass market For those who slept through statistics classwhich is most peopleskewness is the lack of symmetry in a probability distribution The apportionment of business success has an extreme right-tail skewthere are a few big winners and many losers Skewness is present in the stockmarket too Much of the recent advance in America market is built on quite a small group of technology stocks This pattern in which a few shares dominate returns is evident in data going back almost a century Research by Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University finds that over half of the excess returns of equities over cash since 1926 came from fewer than 100 stocks The bulk of the 26000-plus stocks listed since then turned out to be duds Ms Wood does not talk much about “skewness” But the idea is implicit in her pitch The companies she likes are those with the potential for “explosive” or “exponential” growth A lot of Ark research contains optimistic ballpark estimates of “the opportunity” in say digital wallets or driverless taxis Ark signature investment is in Tesla the electric-vehicle maker which spans nearly all of Ark five investment sub-themes Her advocacy of Tesla and of bitcoin has endeared her to the WallStreetBets generation of investors Social media in general has proved an invaluable marketing tool for ArkRivals carp that Ms Wood is selling not skewness but momentum She certainly puts a lot more emphasis on “the story” than on valuation There seems to be no stock price that a would-be disrupter could not grow into in time Any sell-off in tech such as this week swoon is not a warning but an invitation to buy the dip Disruption reinvention and exponential growth are Ark shibboleths The message may not be to all tastes But you may at the very least applaud the skilful marketing “The rest of us are stupidly fighting the tape trying to build balanced portfolios” says an admiring fund manager Ms Wood is instead giving people what they want: a sex-and-violence portfolio undiluted by anything dull or tameAlert readers may by now sense that a biggish “but” is on the way Skewness is a fact of life in tech businesses where the best firms enjoy increasing returns to scale But identifying the winners of the future is not easy They may not even exist yet much less be listed And outside of a few strategies such as index investing asset management is subject to diminishing returns to scaleEvery successful asset manager finds there is a fund size beyond which the magic stops working or begins to do damage Shovelling $60bn into a strategy in which smallish illiquid stocks are prime targets is going to distort the market Already Ark holds a stake of 10% or so in two dozen biotech names If a lot of money flows out from Ark ETFs then the prices of some illiquid holdings could fall hard The latent boom-bust dynamic is made worse by Ms Wood high profile which only encourages copycat investors These add to price momentum on the way up but would also worsen a sell-off Should Ms Wood funds fall from grace as envious rivals predict she is unlikely to fall hard herself She is now associated with an investment thesis that chimes with a big feature of economic reality the superstar firm even if it is speculative and prone to bubbles The Ark effect is both brand new and as old as the hills Many star fund managers of the past found it hard to sustain performance once they grew bigger The good news for Cathie Wood is that none of them ended up in the poorhouse 
 Feb 24th 2021,Prices in the world biggest carbon market are soaring,AS FINANCIAL MARKETS become cheerier about the pace of vaccinations and the chances of a speedy economic recovery the prices of stocks commodities and all sorts of assets are rising So too are carbon prices in Europe home to the world largest emissions-trading system Prices have surged by 60% since November; on February 12th they hit a record high of nearly €40 $49 per tonne of carbon-dioxide equivalent see chartListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLast year the value of global carbon markets hit a record €229bn a five-fold increase from 2017 The EU emissions-trading system ETS accounts for nearly nine-tenths of both that value and that growth China is just starting up; see article In 2020 around €1bn-worth of emissions allowances changed hands a day as well as lots of options and futures contracts There are now clear signs that the market is joining the financial mainstream with hundreds of investment firms trading in itFor a long time after it was launched in 2005 the ETS barely functioned; a glut of allowances which give the holder the right to emit an amount of greenhouse gases kept prices close to zero But after the European Commission sucked out excess permits in 2019 the market began to thriveIt is an odd market The commission auctions allowances nearly every day; it caps the overall supply of permits based on the EU politically determined emissions targets Demand meanwhile comes from three types of participant Power and heating utilities such as Germany RWE and France Engie have the most appetite They buy allowances to cover the emissions from current projects or to hedge against future price increases Next come industrial firms such as ArcelorMittal a steelmaker Most of these receive free permits so that the ETS does not encourage producers to move abroadThe third and growing source of demand is financial firms including banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and hedge funds such as Lansdowne Partners and Northlander Advisors These are not required to hold allowances; instead they hope to profit either by trading on behalf of utilities or by speculating in the futures or options marketsThe recent spike in prices reflects both supply and demand A shift to a new platform delayed some auctions in January meaning fewer allowances were sold And on December 11th EU leaders agreed to speed up cuts to emissions bringing them down by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels rather than by 40% That signalled a lower emissions cap meaning eventually fewer permits and a higher priceThe expectation of higher carbon prices may have prompted industrial firms to start hedging their emissions early this year That added to demand for allowancesas did unusually cold weather which boosted the demand for heating the ETS does not cover boilers in homes but it includes large ones such as those that heat many buildings Speculators may have accelerated the price rise by buoying futures prices Around 230 investment funds hold futures linked to allowances up from 140 in 2019 They account for only about 5% of the futures market but it is a growing bullish share Long positions or bets that the price will rise have doubled since November Aje Singh Rihel of Refinitiv a research firm notes that this measure closely correlates with recent price changesOne reason for investors’ enthusiasm is that carbon seems like a one-way bet Many analysts expect that the EU 55% target will require the number of allowances to fall and prices to rise perhaps towards €80 per tonne That could be good news for investors When in 2018 it became clear the commission was going to intervene to limit supply allowances became the best-performing commodity of the yearBuy and hold is not the only strategy Casey Dwyer of Andurand Capital notes that carbon prices are largely uncorrelated with those of other assets so some investors hold them to diversify their portfolios They could also be used to hedge against inflation: a higher carbon price is generally accompanied by higher consumer pricesThe presence of financial firms has changed how the market works Federico Di Credico of ACT Financial Solutions which specialises in green markets says that the dynamics used to revolve mostly around the commission meetings Now economic indicators such as new GDP figures play a role too Some analysts argue that speculation causes volatility; others say the result is more liquidity Most though expect financial flows to grow“Once investors start to see it as an ESG trade [that takes into account environmental social and governance factors] funds will allocate more money to the carbon markets” predicts Ulf Ek of Northlander Advisors And unlike many forms of ESG investing Europe carbon price where it is applied fully seems to benefit the environment directly Emissions from utilities have fallen by roughly half since the launch of the ETS By contrast the industrial sector which is cushioned by free allowances has seen little improvement What next for the ETS? Some elements including the overall cap will be reviewed in June And the commission has expansion in its sights One idea is to connect the ETS to other regions through a carbon border tax In theory that would protect European industry from carbon-intensive overseas competitors And it may link the ETS to other markets such as Britain soon-to-be-launched ETS and California cap-and-trade scheme Complications around design and geopolitics abound though Few think the commission aim for a border tax by 2023 is realistic More likely is expansion within Europe The scheme covers only 45% of the continent emissions Shipping is expected to join in the next few years Road transport and buildings may get separate markets If done well that expansion should attract more capital and perhaps lead to higher prices But as the market early years show much depends on implementation For all its growing sophistication the ETS is still a political project at heart For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub

 Feb 22nd 2021,What is the cheapest way to cut carbon?,IN THE TRENDIER parts of Berlin cargo bikes are the rage Locals use the bicycles which have a wheelbarrow-sized box at the front to do the weekly shop or ferry children around Because they cut carbon-dioxide emissions local authorities are subsidising the craze But the well-intentioned schemes look pricey when you consider how much carbon is abated One such scheme costs the city €370000 $450000 but is expected to reduce emissions by only seven tonnes a year That works out at over €50000 per tonne abated The equivalent figure for schemes that support the sale of low-carbon heating systems by contrast is €200 per tonneListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKMore than 100 countries and 400 cities including Berlin have promised to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 or before Investors and regulators are encouraging companies to do the same To meet these goals policymakers and bosses will have to pick from a menu of policies from building wind farms to subsidising low-carbon jet fuel That raises an important question: what is the cheapest way to cut carbon? One way to discern the answer is to impose a price on carbon either as a tax or a cap-and-trade scheme This would encourage firms and consumers to find the cheapest ways to abate But setting a price is difficult politically Only a fifth of the world emissions are covered by an explicit price Even in Europe the world biggest liquid carbon market free credits still allow many industries to maintain emissions So other tools are needed too In his new book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster” Bill Gates suggests using a “green premium” or the gap between the price of clean activities and dirty ones as a guide Where the premium is low zero-carbon alternatives exist and consumers have no reason not to use them Where the premium is high more innovation is neededA similar approach popular in climate circles for the past decade or so is to consider the marginal costs of abatement Like green premiums these compute the costs of a climate intervention including operating costs and upfront spending But it compares them with the emissions that the policy is expected to abate Plotting the costs and emissions abated on a curve shows the policies that provide the most bang for the buck see chart 1Such curves have been computed by a number of forecasters over the years including McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group two consultancies; Goldman Sachs a bank; and Britain Climate Change Commission which advises Parliament As a rule most show that the biggest bang comes from making buildings more energy-efficient say by installing insulation or smart cooling and heating systems Often these have negative costs: analysts think they will eventually save consumers money through cheaper billsThe next-best bang for the buck tends to be replacing power plants that burn natural gas or coal with renewable-powered ones There is less agreement about what the next-best option is after that But the most expensive areas of the economy to decarbonise tend to be transport planes and ships heavy industry steel and cement and agriculture cows belching methane In these cases clean cheap scalable alternatives do not yet existJust as abatement-cost curves provide a rough guide for policymakers they also show how difficult the maths is Estimates of costs vary widely for instance see chart 2 A paper by Kenneth Gillingham of Yale University and James Stock of Harvard University compares the marginal costs of policies across 50-odd studies The cost of wind-energy subsidies can range from more than $260 per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided to next to nothingThis is partly because a technology abatement potential can vary from place to place Some countries such as Britain are blessed with high winds and shallow seas that are ideal for offshore wind farms In other places wind energy will provide scant abatementWorking out costs is tricky too The International Energy Agency IEA for instance has routinely underestimated the pace of deployment of renewables And because economies of scale drive down prices that means it has overestimated the costs of switching too In 2010 the lowest the IEA expected solar prices to drop to over the next decade was about $195 per megawatt hour Today the price in America and Europe is $30-60 see chart 3Nor do abatement-cost curves show how technologies interact Hydrogen is rarely produced without emissions But if it were the Hydrogen Council reckons it could be used in 35 different green applications from storing energy to heating buildings Ignoring this could lead to underinvestment in hydrogen power todayInteractions also affect how much interventions reduce emissions Consider two things needed to decarbonise the economy: converting the grid to low-carbon power and electrifying transport The order in which you do these matters According to a model developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others if transport were electrified there would be less demand for oil to fill tanks with petrol Yet as the demand for dirty power for electricity would surge overall emissions would drop by only 2% by 2050 compared with a business-as-usual baseline If the grid were cleaned up first though then emissions would fall by about 30%Faced with all these difficulties forecasters are taking a more sophisticated approach rather than simply working their way along the marginal-cost curve Goldman Sachs is incorporating different scenarios and a wider range of costs into its analysis Others are turning to “energy-systems” modelling which estimates models over and over again with different assumptions That lets technologies interact and means that forecasts rely less on one set of assumptions for say pricesThis type of analysis lets you sort climate actions into three categories says Jesse Jenkins of Princeton University all of which require funding The first are what he calls “robust” interventions such as improving energy efficiency which are valuable across lots of scenarios Next come “shaping” interventions such as investing in hydrogen and batteries which improve the likelihood of arriving at a low-carbon future Then come “hedging” strategies: long-shot options to develop just in case such as direct-air-capture which sucks carbon dioxide from the atmosphere The result is a more complex framework better suited to deal with the complex ever more urgent task of decarbonisation For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our climate-change hub
 Feb 20th 2021,What market break-evens do and don’t tell you about inflation fears,IF YOU HAD to pick an emblem of the wild ride that financial markets have been on it would be Carnival When the pandemic took hold its cruise ships were regarded as floating petri-dishes Yet last April it was able to raise capital as the corporate-bond market thawed More recently it raised $35bn at half the interest rate that it paid last year Now all the talk is of pent-up consumer demand and the inflation that will unleash Carnival bookings for the first half of 2022 are above their level in 2019 The company has captured the market zeitgeist once againListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIf you can marvel at the speed of the firm change of fortune marvel too at another turnaround The yield gap between ten-year Treasury inflation-protected bonds TIPS and conventional bonds of the same maturity is widely seen as a measure of long-term inflation expectations These inflation “break-evens” have soared to 22% from a low of just 05% last March Serious people are talking of a return to 1970s-style inflation In America bumper fiscal-stimulus packages seem to arrive like overdue buses one after another They are layered on top of unprecedented monetary easing and a pledge by the Federal Reserve to tolerate inflation above 2% for a while The case for higher inflation seems more persuasive than it has for years But break-evens will not tell you a lot about whether it might be sustained They are too volatile to be a reliable guide A jump in annual inflation seems assured Last spring when cruise liners were beached there was a glut of crude oil in storage and in seaborne tankers The month-ahead price of oil briefly turned negative A year on inventories are falling The price of a barrel of Brent crude has surged past $60 The trend is mirrored in the rising prices of other commodities That will push up year-on-year comparisons of prices and thus annual inflation Commodity markets offer a template of what could yet happen in the wider economy: a surge in demand meets constrained supply leading to inflation In the central-banking model expectations are self-fulfilling: businesses set prices and wages in accordance with the inflation they look ahead to Yet it would be unwise to put too much faith in break-evens They often reflect market influences that are only tangential to future inflation Look at Britain for instance Legislation in 2004 obliged pension funds to match their assets to their long-term promises This in turn spurred demand for long-dated index-linked bonds and the debt-management office issued lots more of them Despite this issuance the demand for inflation protection has over time driven real yields down to unusually low levels and pushed up break-evensIn America the oil price appears to have an outsize influence on break-evens A simple model based on the oil price and the dollar tracks market measures of expected inflation quite closely according to a recent note by Steven Englander of Standard Chartered a bank His model based on data from 2006 to 2016 predicts the recent rise in break-evens pretty well Sharp rises in the oil price tend to push up inflation but the effect is temporary They ought not to influence medium-term break-evens but in practice they do Bonds respond to changes in risk appetite in ways that have implications for implied break-evens too says Eric Lonergan of M&G a fund manager The ten-year Treasury is the quintessential safe asset It is liquid unlike TIPS and investors use it as protection against extreme moves in share prices When the stockmarket falls hard as it did last March the price of a ten-year Treasury typically rallies and the yield collapses as investors seek safety But as risk appetite returns the effect unwinds The yield curve has steepenedwhich is to say yields on longer-dated bonds have risen relative to those on shorter-dated bondsas it tends to at the start of an economic recovery A corollary is that break-evens have also risen But this is mostly the outcome of shifting attitudes to risk rather than forecasts of inflationFor all their shortcomings inflation break-evens are closely watched The whole edifice of asset prices from shares to homes rests on rock-bottom interest rates and thus on quiescent inflation Before the pandemic financial markets were prone to periodic growth scares trade wars an over-zealous Fed and so on that spooked stockmarkets Now we seem to be set for a series of inflation scares And Carnival cruise liners are not even at sea yet

Euronext the company that runs exchanges in cities including Amsterdam Brussels and Paris has focused on building relationships with big and small tech companies all over Europe says Michael Werner a stock analyst at UBS a Swiss bank The aim is to become the listing venue of choice for hot tech companies Several factors make the Dutch exchange more attractive than its continental rivals Its regulation and governance framework such as its tolerance of dual-class voting structures are slightly more favourable to companies Its first-class internet infrastructure makes it easy to trade fast And the fact that English is so widely and well spoken probably helps attract foreignersNonetheless in most respects London crown is still secure Take the Dutch IPO boom which starts from a very low base Last year only two companies went public in Amsterdam compared with 33 on London stock exchange; 11 firms have already listed in London this year to Amsterdam one A spokeswoman for Euronext says that it is “too early to draw any conclusions” from the jump in trading volumeFor Marieke Blom of ING a Dutch bank the big question is whether the Brexit effect proves temporary or not The EU is considering whether to grant Britain equivalence Even if it does Amsterdam could still benefit from a virtuous circle Stock exchanges compete so aggressively for the thin-margin business of share trading because liquidity begets liquidity The high volume of trading should make it easier for sellers and buyers to find each other and that should make the exchange more attractive for listings Some of Amsterdam gains will probably stick

 Feb 20th 2021,What a hot American economy means for the rest of the world,WHEN AMERICA sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold But what happens when it runs a fever? After a trying 2020 in which GDP fell by 35% America is poised to enjoy a robust rebound in 2021 simply by returning to something like normal as vaccination proceeds Yet it might manage more than just that If President Joe Biden covid-19 relief bill is enacted total stimulus this year may exceed $25trn That could easily push output above what the Congressional Budget Office estimates to be its “potential” level: that is the amount the economy can produce without an increase in inflationary pressure This possibility has some American economists on the lookout for signs of accelerating growth in prices and wages America does not operate in a vacuum however; should overheating occur its effects will not be confined within its borders Depending on how the recovery plays out a hot American economy could be a boon for the rest of the worldor yet another source of concernListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKIn a closed economy that does not trade with the rest of the world too little spending leads to job losses and downward pressure on prices whereas too much should push up employment and eventually prices In an open economy however some of the effects of the shifts in demand spill over to the rest of the world A sharp drop in spending for instance may be associated with plunging demand for imports in which case some of the pain of a slump is exported abroad During the global financial crisis of 2007-09 troubles in financial markets wreaked havoc all over the world but even countries relatively insulated from those woes felt a chill thanks to trade links with America and Europe According to one estimate about a quarter of the drop in American demand and a fifth of the fall in European demand was borne by other economies and transmitted through tradeA boost to demand ought to work in a similar way but in the other direction As Americans spend more some of it leaks abroad: through purchases of foreign goods for example or spending on servicesincluding tourism which should begin to rebound as pandemic restrictions are lifted An analysis of fiscal-policy spillovers published by the IMF in 2017 found that an American stimulus consisting mostly of spending as opposed to tax cuts and worth 1% of GDP raises the output of the average country by 033% in the first year Countries with closer trade ties experience bigger effects; the fillip to Canada economy is estimated to be almost three times the average for example If the combination of reopening and stimulus invigorates the American consumer the effects could quickly be felt all over the world The degree to which it is felt however depends crucially on the policy response both at home and abroad Fiscal spillovers are more powerful when recipient countries are themselves operating below potential American spending is thus more likely to spill over to the rest of the world if its recovery is much stronger than those of its trading partners Ordinarily spillovers provide a strong incentive for governments to co-ordinate their stimulus effortslest some tight-fisted economies eg those in Europe free ride on the largesse leaking from more generous ones Indeed on February 12th Janet Yellen America treasury secretary urged her counterparts in the G7 group of countries to “go big” on stimulus too Countries that free ride could find themselves in hot water with Ms Yellen: the Biden administration has promised to be stern with countries that run large persistent trade surplusesBut if America does come close to overheating then a reluctance to spend elsewhere may be less irksome than usual as demand-starved countries serve as a release valve for the pressure building up at home Growth in global trade seems to have enhanced its pressure-relieving capabilities according to work by Jane Ihrig Steven Kamin Deborah Lindner and Jaime Marquez of the Federal Reserve They reckon that the expansion in trade has served to weaken the link between changes in domestic demand and corresponding shifts in total output with net exports bearing more of the burden of adjustment to changes in domestic spending In the late 1990s for instance measures of domestic demand grew even faster than real GDP which was itself growing at a rapid clip Inflation remained relatively subdued however in part because America current account deficit swelled Similarly a surge in imports this year might dissipate potential inflationary pressures in America while giving a lift to its weaker trade partnersBuilt to spilloverThe biggest uncertainty about the global effects of a hot American economy is the reaction of the Fed Recent work by Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that domestic inflation has become more responsive over time to global factorsincluding the amount of economic slack across the global economy as a whole Yet wage inflation still seems to respond mostly to domestic conditions The Fed might therefore shrug off price rises later this year reckoning that short-run price pressures will not translate into sustained inflation until America job market and the world economy is fully recovered A doveish Fed should make for a weaker dollar and easier financial conditions worldwide adding to the boost that comes from Americans buying more goods from abroadBut a really rip-roaring economy could test the Fed patience particularly if a yawning current account deficit and soaring asset prices cause it to worry about a build-up of financial risk The spectre of American interest-rate hikes could frighten global markets and force emerging economies to adopt less stimulative fiscal and monetary policies A bit of demand spilling over from America would seem insignificant in comparison That the Fed will suddenly turn hawkish still seems unlikely But if America temperature runs high enough the rest of the world may break out in cold sweats

often new investors are brought in to provide more capital When the deal is done the sponsor receives a slice of the merged firm equity and typically a seat on the company board The pot of capital is now cash to be used by the newly public firmProponents say SPACs are cheaper than conventional initial public offerings IPOs but they still incur underwriting fees and the sponsor share of the proceeds dilutes other shareholders The path to going public can be shorter and less uncertain than an IPO though A firm merging with a SPAC knows exactly how much capital it will raiseThough SPACs have been around as a financing vehicle for almost two decades they were regarded warily for much of that timeas a route to be used only by firms shunned by sharp-suited investment bankers The latest mania can be traced to a serendipitous deal struck in 2019 by Chamath Palihapitiya a venture capitalist turned boss of a SPAC and Sir Richard Branson a billionaire businessmanMr Palihapitiya SPAC had raised $674m wooing investors with promises of disrupting the IPO scene Sir Richard had sought funding for Virgin Galactic a space-venture company from Saudi Arabia sovereign-wealth fund But after Jamal Khashoggi a journalist was killed in a Saudi consulate in Turkey Sir Richard suspended the plan A year later Virgin Galactic merged with the SPAC It received the $674m pot and another $100m in investment from Mr Palihapitiya and went public at a valuation of $22bn Its market capitalisation is now $12bn That success set off the trend Today SPACs range from the tiddlers with less than $50m in capital to the titans such as Mr Ackman $4bn SPAC The median SPAC raises $240m at the initial stage Some issue vast quantities of warrants and hand sponsors fat slices of firms; others are leaner Some have target industries in mind; others are ambivalent High-profile deals tend to spawn mini-trends After Virgin Galactic went public several space deals took off; when Nikola an electric-truck maker merged with a SPAC interest in electric-vehicle deals picked up; the enthusiasm for sports-SPACs follows the listing of DraftKings a sports-betting platform in AprilTheir sudden popularity and the sheer variety of their size scope and structure raise the question of which SPACs are sensible and which show signs of mania A financier in charge of a big investment bank SPAC business sees a clear bifurcation There are plenty of good SPACs with excellent management teams that can help turn mediocre companies into good ones But the rest perhaps a third to two-thirds “don’t know the first thing about the businesses they are dealing with”That seems to be confirmed by a recent study by Michael Klausner and Emily Ruan of Stanford University and Michael Ohlrogge of New York University The authors look at blank-cheque firms that made acquisitions between January 2019 and June 2020 They find that in 25% of cases the sponsor payout exceeded 12% of post-merger equity compared with a median stake of 77%They also conclude that some SPACs deliver far worse returns for investors than others: companies that went public through the SPAC route fell in value by an average of 3% after three months 12% after six months and by a third after 12 months They lagged behind the wider market and even further behind an index of firms that listed via IPOHowever about half the sample is made up of “high-quality” SPACs defined as those run by former Fortune 500 bosses or set up by large private-equity firms These perform much better outperforming IPOs and the wider market over six months though not over 12How might the craze play out? About three-quarters of SPACs launched last year are yet to do a deal One scenario worth considering is that bumper issuance leaves many SPACs unable to find suitable targets Investors can redeem their shares at cost until a target is bought the proceeds from the SPAC IPO are kept in an escrow account in the meantime The burden of failurethe SPAC set-up and search expenseswould therefore probably fall on sponsors In order to avoid this many might take any willing firm public Voting and redemption mechanisms guard investors against dodgy deals though they have not prevented investors from losing money so farInvestors’ willingness to accept poor returns may wane as they become more familiar with SPACs They certainly grasp that those like Mr Ackman which will issue him 67% of the shares in the merged firm only once investors earn a 20% return are more sensibly structured valuing it more handsomely than the rest Its share prices are trading at 50% above their IPO level But they also still want to take a punt on Nikola and other electric-vehicle copycats in the hope of finding the next Tesla Seen this way the mania around SPACs is simply an expression of wider exuberance

A handful of clever people worked out that subprime bonds were likely to suffer a higher rate of default than was suggested by their price or credit rating So they bet against the riskiest tranches of the worst pools They entered into agreements with banks called credit-default swaps CDS which insured specific mortgage bonds against default In 2007 and 2008 default rates soared The CDS insurance was triggered The payoff was as spectacular as a Tony Yeboah goal Why didn’t more people bet this way? Mr Brown and Mr Dewey spoke to investors who considered the short subprime trade but passed on it One turn-off was the Big Short steeply negative “cost of carry”: the premium on CDS insurance was high Moreover mortgage CDS were illiquid instruments making it tricky to get out of the trade A high cost of carry is a big bar when the payday might be years awayif it comes at all The banks that were the counterparties to the CDS could be dragged under Maybe the government would make good all mortgage-holders when the bust came History did not play out this way But investors could not be sure at the timeTraders found other ways to bet against the bubble One was to sidestep the negative-carry problem by buying risky tranches of subprime securities with double-digit yields and at the same time taking out insurance on “safe” AAA tranches using CDS with a fairly low premium The bet here was that a housing bust would blow up both risky and safe tranches; but while waiting for the apocalypse you could benefit from positive carry Perhaps the safest way to profit from a bubble is the pick-up-the-pieces trade in this case buying mortgage bonds at fire-sale prices after the bustA subtext of the Brown-Dewey paper is that conviction can be your enemy Knowing for sure that something is very askew may not be enough to make you money Still the precariousness of the Big Short is a big part of its legend Yes things might have played out differently And if Tony Yeboah shot were an inch higher then it would not have been a goal But it was not a fluke He had scored an equally spectacular goal against Liverpool a month earlier That one went in off the crossbar too

 Feb 11th 2021,Washing machines reveal how trade and competition are linked,AMERICAN WASHING-MACHINE makers received a parting gift from President Donald Trump Days before leaving office he extended tariffs on imported machines by two years The move was a victory for Whirlpool an appliance-maker that has sought protection for nearly a decade The saga is a case study of the impact of protectionism on competition at homeListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKAmerican businesses can ask the government for three types of protection from foreign rivals: anti-dumping duties if imports are being sold below cost; countervailing duties if foreign competition is subsidised; or safeguard tariffs if imports are surging Petitions succeed around 60% of the time; in 2016 just over 7% of America product lines were affected by a temporary trade barrier That compares with about 4% in the European UnionWhen Whirlpool first sought help in 2011 it accused its South Korean competitors Samsung and LG of selling at prices that were too low Its rivals said its failure to innovate was the problem The United States International Trade Commission USITC which follows trade-remedy law written to protect producers not consumers found for Whirlpool That led to tariffs of up to 82% on some washing machines from South Korea and Mexico where Samsung had a factoryOnly six years before that Whirlpool had used the promise of competition from Samsung and LG to justify consolidation at home Trustbusters had been suspicious of its acquisition of Maytag an American rival which united more than 70% of domestic production of household washing machines But partly because they were assured of stiff foreign competition they let the deal go ahead William Kovacic then a member of the Federal Trade Commission was so peeved by the case that he now argues that merger approvals should require companies to waive their right to seek tariff protectionBut the duties Whirlpool had secured were easy to dodge When Samsung and LG started sending machines from their factories in China to America Whirlpool asked the USITC to hit imports from there too Accused of undercutting again the South Korean firms protested that “bundled pricing” distorted the facts Washing machines often looked like they were sold at low margins but in fact were being bundled together with driers which were sold at high margins When seen as an integrated unit an apparently low-return washing-machine business could in fact be making adequate profits But the commission ruled in favour of Whirlpool againThe source of imports had already changed thoughto Thailand and Vietnam So rather than continue with the game of whack-a-mole in 2017 Whirlpool made a bolder request: for a safeguard tariff which hits imports whatever their source It is also temporary to give domestic firms time to become competitive The USITC recommended tariffs of 20% rising to 50% above a quota of 12m units in the first year with the protection fading over three years Presidents can veto such requests but Mr Trump did notThe new restrictions were implemented in February 2018 As the law intended imports fell and American production rose According to a study by Aaron Flaaen of the Federal Reserve and Ali Hortaçsu and Felix Tintelnot of the University of Chicago retail prices of washing machines also rose by 12%with those of dryers rising in step Whirlpool made some investments including in a new training centre in Clyde Ohio A review of the tariffs in 2019 found that its profitability increasedYet Whirlpool came back for more In November last year its lawyers complained that the tariff was meant to give it three fat years of profits to recover from the harm caused by imports But Samsung and LG had brought in machines before the tariff came in dampening its effect Then came covid-19 Had the USITC known what market conditions would be Whirlpool lawyers argued it would surely have recommended greater protectionBy then Samsung and LG had opened factories in America How much of this and the resulting jobs reflects the tariff is up for debate but it may have speeded up the decision to set up shop in America The Korean firms argued that they were now part of the domestic industryand did not need tariffs They pointed out that the domestic industry was clearly thriving: around 80% of washing machines bought in America were now home-made Still the USITC decided that without an extension cheap imports would flood in Mr Trump did not disagree so the tariffs will remain until 2023 Whirlpool says the decision reflects its efforts to ensure fair trade and to protect employeesThe result will be close to a decade of protection arguably at the cost of customers’ wallets But Whirlpool has little recourse for protection left and now faces stiff competition at home In November a representative of LG said its new factory in Tennessee had in some cases shrunk the gap between order and delivery from 12 weeks to a few days Canny use of tariffs might help some producers some of the time But competition cannot be avoided for ever

Some have been quick to do so India budget this month envisaged a deficit of 95% of GDP this fiscal year the overall deficit which includes state finances could reach 15% of GDP reckons JPMorgan Chase a bank and offered no plan to bring it below the 3% limit prescribed by past fiscal rules The latest economic survey by the government chief economic adviser points out that India interest rate has been below its growth rate “by norm not by exception” Quoting from Mr Blanchard work the survey tries to “provide the intellectual anchor for the government to be more relaxed about debt and fiscal spending during a growth slowdown or an economic crisis” But although doveish fiscal maths is the norm in many emerging economies finance ministers must also worry about the exceptions to itWhen interest rates fall short of growth rates the budgetary algebra becomes a little contrary Governments can keep debt steady relative to the size of the economy even if they consistently overspend as long as their budget deficits are not too large If their deficits excluding interest payments exceed this limit temporarily their debt ratio will rise temporarily But it will then gradually decline to its previous level If their deficits move to a permanently higher level the debt ratio also settles at a higher level But it will not snowball because the power of compound interest is offset by the power of compound growthTo grasp the weirdness ponder the following scenario Suppose a government can keep debt stable at 60% of GDP with a deficit before interest payments of 3% Then suppose a pandemic strikes pushing debt to 80% of GDP You might think that this higher debt is harder to sustain requiring a tighter budget than before the pandemic You would be wrong To stabilise the new debt ratio the government needs a 4% deficit insteadAlthough this fiscal mathematics is peculiar it is not novel The growth-corrected interest rate has been less than zero in emerging economies 75% of the time according to Paolo Mauro and Jing Zhou of the IMF who have looked as far back as the data allow Economists have nonetheless been wary of taking this arithmetic too literally Emerging economies have traditionally borrowed in hard currencies such as the dollar If their exchange rate weakens their foreign-currency debts can increase sharply relative to the size of their economies even if interest rates remain modest The cost of borrowing can also rise quickly if investors fear default a fear that can become self-fulfilling And this rise in interest rates may not be gentle or early enough to provide much prior warning In recent decades most emerging economies have found it easier to borrow in their own currencies That makes their debt safer because their central banks can in theory print the money owed to creditors if need be But the fear of some kind of default still lingers Wenxin Du of the University of Chicago and Jesse Schreger of Columbia University have compared the yields on local-currency bonds to those on American Treasuries “swapped” into the same emerging-market currency via derivatives This allows them to disentangle credit risk from currency risk They find that emerging-market bonds typically pay a premium which presumably represents compensation for the risk of default or some other form of expropriation such as new taxes or capital controls This premium spiked in March 2020 before returning to less alarming levels see chart 2 Borrowing in rupiah or pesos introduces other dangers If investors fear a fall in the currency they demand a higher interest rate This is especially likely if the investors are foreigners with obligations in other currencies Countries like Indonesia borrow mostly in their own currency over 60% of government debt is in rupiah but not from their own people over half of its debt is owed to non-residentsEven if government debt is sustainable it may not be desirable Economists have long worried that public borrowing can crowd out private investment or hurt the trade balance That is less of a concern if the government spends on investment India central government for example has budgeted a 26% increase in capital spending in the coming fiscal year It is also less of a worry if the economy is operating below capacity: public spending can then “crowd in” additional investment by improving incomes and profit prospectsBut before embarking on a spending spree a conscientious government must bear other considerations in mind Is the economy below capacity because of a lack of spending rather than public-health restrictions? Are inflation expectations contained? Is monetary easing unable to revive demand instead? If the answers are yes governments can spend with greater conviction But in fact the answers vary across the emerging world China is probably near full capacity Inflation is too high in Argentina and Turkey Most central banks have room to cut interest rates though India worries that cuts will not work until its troubled banks regain their footingCrowding out if it happens is probably more damaging in emerging markets They have less capital per person than richer economies which should leave them with more rewarding investment opportunities The low interest rate paid by their governments is not necessarily a sign that the return on capital is low It may also reflect regulations forcing banks to load up on government paper This kind of financial repression once widespread persists in places like India and Argentina Mr Blanchard seems more cautious about emerging markets than some of those who cite his work His Ashoka lecture showed a “prudent level of tentativeness that I find very appealing” said his host Arvind Subramanian himself a former adviser to India government Mr Blanchard thinks policymakers in the rich and poor world alike should ask themselves two hard questions: how high might interest rates rise relative to growth rates in a plausible stress case? And how tight a budget would be politically possible in response? The answers give a rough indication of the debt ratio a country can comfortably expect to sustain That ratio is likely to be lower for many emerging economies than for advanced ones he believes They may find it harder to rustle up tax revenue in a pinch And their interest rates have a higher possible peak even if their average is lower once growth is deducted In the past conventional wisdom maintained that the safe debt limit was 60% of GDP for advanced economies and 40% for emerging ones “These were nonsensical numbers” Mr Blanchard said after his lecture “But the inequality was right” 
 Feb 11th 2021,China leads in precision-guided central banking Does it work?,IN ECONOMICS TEXTBOOKS central banks wield power by raising or lowering interest rates That depiction always a little simplistic is now badly out of date Since the financial crisis of 2007-09 and especially since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic central bankers have dramatically expanded their arsenals They have bought trillions of dollars in assetsmostly government bondsto keep economies and financial systems from freezing up And they have become more hands-on trying to steer cash to “real” businesses not just to markets These actions reflect both the severity of the economic shock and the constraints on monetary policy in rich countries where short-term policy rates are already at or below zero But when it comes to unconventional interventions it is a central bank in a very different situationmanaging the world strongest major economythat is by far the busiestListen to this story Enjoy more

banks the People Bank of China PBoC has refrained from expanding its balance-sheet Yet it is ever more determined to guide money flows Since 2014 it has introduced at least ten separate targeted tools to that end and tweaked them constantly There have been credit facilities for small businesses and farmers new money for the construction of affordable housing adjustments to banks’ required reserves if they lend to favoured sectors plus caps on loans to risky industries from property to steel Such is the scope of activity that economists in China now distinguish between two kinds of monetary policy: “aggregate policies” like interest rates that affect the whole economy and “structural policies” that support this or that sector As central banks elsewhere gravitate towards more targeted actions China record with structural monetary policy deserves attentionThe pandemic has illustrated the merits of targeted monetary policy Back-stopped by central-bank facilities Chinese banks deferred loan repayments for millions of companies and issued credit to those on the frontlines such as makers of medical supplies A similar response has been seen in the rich world But in China the point of targeting goes beyond emergency relief It is used to achieve other goals: in a report published on February 8th the PBoC said structural policies were like “drip irrigation” for the economy helping channel financial support towards technological innovation and environmental protectionThe big attraction of structural monetary policy for China is that in theory it tackles a dilemma at the heart of the financial system: credit growth is needed to sustain rapid economic growth but overall debt levels are already very high particularly among state-owned companies In explicitly encouraging banks to lend to less-indebted companies in promising sectors policymakers have a set of three objectives: generating more growth with less debt while also modernising the economyTo hear it from the PBoC the experience has been a resounding success It says it has catalysed 151trn yuan $24trn in “inclusive loans” credit to very small businesses more than double the amount three years ago reaching some 32m firms in all The average interest rate on these loans in December was 51% not much higher than the interest rate on government debt Small businesses left to fend for themselves would never enjoy such good termsBut a closer look at the data raises questions about the efficacy of targeting The overall shape of the economy has changed little The liability-to-asset ratio for state firmsa measure of their indebtednessis only slightly lower than it was five years ago when the PBoC ramped up its structural policies Moreover the jump in “inclusive loans” is misleading Small firms broadly defined account for just a quarter of overall bank lending little changed over the years Without targeting perhaps the imbalances would have been even worse But it is hard to escape the conclusion that the practice has had a marginal impact on financial flowsDespite the PBoC official bluster about structural monetary policy many economists who work in its regional branches are more sceptical They have started to crank out research papers mostly in Chinese on the topic Fu Hongrui and Zhong Zhenzhen argue that communication is a stumbling block For central banks to hit their mark it helps if companies and investors understand their intent so that they have the confidence to push in the same direction The PBoC however provides only basic information about its targeted operations with scant details about who actually receives its credit This argue the researchers blunts the benefits In another paper Yin Xingshan and two other PBoC economists argue that structural monetary policies do not get at the roots of China problems True solutions would include transforming state-owned companies into profit-focused entities and increasing competition in the banking sector The central bank on its own will struggle to cure the economy “chronic disease”Structural weaknessesThe PBoC which lacks formal independence cannot very well say no when the government wants it to be more activist It has taken to describing “precision” as one of the core aims of its policies But some of its economists worry about the consequences Chen Ge a central-bank researcher enumerates a series of risks To obtain special loans from the PBoC banks need to post collateral There is little to stop them throwing ineligible loans into the mix The central bank thus faces balance-sheet hazards if some of the dodgier assets go bad Moreover it is hard to monitor whether banks use the credit as promised And if companies and banks become more reliant on the PBoC for direct support it will grow progressively harder to unwind the interventionsThe answer Mr Chen concludes is for the government to step in and do more with its fiscal space taking weight off the PBoCa prescription that will sound wearily familiar to central bankers elsewhere The PBoC may be following a different path But it is arriving at a similar destination 
 Feb 8th 2021,Why the prices of both oil and the metals that seek to replace it are rising,OIL IS MAKING a comeback at least on the face of it On February 8th the price of Brent crude rose above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than a year Battery metals too are enjoying a run-up The prices of cobalt lithium and some rare-earth metals have soared since late 2020 with copper and nickel enjoying a longer climb It is tempting to see the surge as evidence of competing bets about the fuels of the future For both oil and battery metals the reality is more complex Listen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKSome of the rise in oil prices is of course linked to expectations about demand Oil investors have taken hope that rising Chinese demand might be matched elsewhere In India consumption of liquefied petroleum gas widely used as a cooking fuel is up In America President Joe Biden proposed stimulus of $19trn may bring a jump in economic activity and therefore oil demand However the pace of economic recovery is not assured The faltering roll-out of vaccines and the emergence of new more contagious strains of covid-19 continue to weigh on oil markets Indeed climbing oil prices have much more to do with constraints in supply than with confidence in demand Most important Saudi Arabia the de facto leader of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries looks determined to support prices In January the kingdom said it would cut production by an additional 1m barrels a day in February and March Elsewhere output continues to be restrained Among some African producers supply is starting to suffer from deferred investment in new projects and declining output from existing ones In America crude output in January was 13% lower than a year before according to Goldman Sachs a bank Exports from Iran seem unlikely to pick up quickly In an interview with CBS News aired on February 7th Mr Biden said he had no immediate plans to lift sanctions on the countryFor battery metals demand has helped boost prices Much of the interest is coming from China: in December sales of plug-in electric vehicles there surpassed 224000 a record high and 94% of total vehicle sales That has supported demand for cobalt lithium and rare-earth minerals such as neodymium and praseodymium But constraints on supply have played an important role tooCovid-19 disrupted ports in South Africa from where much of the world cobalt is shipped and in China the world biggest miner and exporter of rare-earth metals Nickel mines in Indonesia were also pandemic-struck In New Caledonia a small group of Pacific islands that is the world fourth-biggest producer of nickel protests in December demanding public control of national resources blockaded several mines that are part-owned by foreign firmsAs the 2020s continue you might expect the prices of oil and battery metals to diverge as demand for crude ebbs and that for electric cars and other green technologies jumps However there may well be a period when supply constraints mean that the values of oil and battery metals continue to rise in concert Start with oil In the past higher prices prompted more spending on projects which increased production and lowered prices There are already signs that this mechanism is breaking down In recent years dismal returns and fear of regulation have made investors wary of capital expenditures Their disdain for spending has intensified thanks to covid-19 rapid depression of demand and the election of Mr Biden Since taking office in January he has announced a temporary moratorium on new drilling leases on federal lands as well as plans for stricter regulation of methane emissions and greater scrutiny of pipelines None of this has a huge immediate effect on oil supply but serves to make investors even more sceptical of any big increase in companies’ capital programmes In January BlackRock the world largest asset manager urged companies to disclose how their strategies align with a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 Little wonder that in recent weeks ExxonMobil and other oil supermajors shaken by large annual losses have reiterated pledges of capital disciplineMeanwhile a wave of green enthusiasm is sweeping the markets Tesla an electric-vehicle maker is more valuable than the eight next-biggest carmakers combined JPMorgan Chase a bank reckons the share of electric vehicles excluding hybrids in global new vehicle sales will rise from 3% in 2020 to 15% in 2030 Electric cars account for about a quarter of demand for cobalt a similar share for neodymium and praseodymium and nearly half of the demand for lithium according to CRU Group a consultancy Other green technologies are supporting prices too Copper is essential not only for electric cars but also for solar panels wind turbines and 5G infrastructure The recent rally may therefore be a sign of a strange pattern to come: higher prices for both oil and the metals that may help replace it For more coverage of climate change

listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKLook beyond the memes and the mania though and the story tells you something about the deep structural changes in financial markets The fact that the fast-paced frenzy was possible is a testament to just how frictionless trading stocks has become aided by technological advances Shares can be bought on an app while you queue for a coffee at a price that is whisker-close to the wholesale priceProgress towards unfettered stockmarket access began in 1975 with the abolition of huge fixed commissions and the entry of discount brokers like Charles Schwab says Yakov Amihud of New York University Then came automated trading and the decimalisation of share prices By the 2010s high-frequency traders had risen to dominate share trading see article “At each stop along the road the market offloaded some trading costs and liquidity improved” says Mr AmihudTrading costs tumbled and the quantity of shares traded ballooned The more participants piled in the quicker and cheaper it became to trade in turn see chart 1 In 2015 Robinhood the online broker through which many GameStop trades would flow was launched becoming the first platform to charge users no fees at all That and the pandemic which freed up time and provided stimulus cheques as starter funds have spurred retail participation to new heights Retail investors made up a tenth of trading volumes in America in 2019 By January this year their share had risen to a quarterAs frictions were sanded down powerful institutional investors that had padded their bottom lines by charging meaty fees for exposure to stocks saw the assets they control slip away Now they compete with a range of vastly cheaper offerings: index funds that track the market; exchange-traded funds ETFs which offer access to baskets of assets; and robo-advisers which allocate cash among cheap funds according to portfolio-management theories Such innovations possible thanks to advances in computing power and machine learning have probably saved investors $1trn or more in fees since 1975Outside stocks fat fees and thin volumes still gum up markets resulting in slow-motion transactions and deterring traders But the same forces that pushed down trading costs and drove up liquidity in the stockmarket are poised to disrupt all manner of assets from corporate bonds to property and even Picassos and classic cars As happened with stocks this will eventually empower individuals at the expense of established intermediariesWherever you look technology has helped create new liquid markets “The market for knick-knacks in the attic was once illiquid” says Alvin Roth a Nobel-prize-winning economist “The internet made it possible to have your lawn sale on eBay” GPS and smartphones made ride-sharing appswhich create thick markets for journeyspossibleExamples in financial markets abound In 19th-century America buyers travelled from farm to farm testing wheat before striking a deal with a single farmer Then railways made it possible to move grains cheaply in silo cars But these silos also made it wasteful to store farmers’ grains separately So in 1848 the Chicago Board of Trade started classifying wheat by quality 1 the best 5 the worst and by type red or white soft or hard winter or spring Standardisation brought down the cost of moving and shopping for grains making the market more efficient The process was so effective that the word commodity is now synonymous with standardisationBut building a liquid market for an asset is not easy To see why compare the markets for bonds and property with equities They are broadly comparable in size see chart 2 Yet bonds and buildings change hands in different ways This is largely the result of fragmentation There are 4400 listed firms in America An investor buying a share in AT&T does not care which one they holdit is as if they were picking from a set of identical marbles Now imagine they want to buy an AT&T bond It is as if a single marble had been smashed into hundreds of pieces each of them different There are 224 AT&T bonds alone: each pay different coupons mature at different times and are worth different amounts And there are 300000 distinct corporate bonds in America Now imagine the investor wants to buy property All those marble fragments have been ground into sand Available figures suggest there are 5m-6m commercial buildings and more than 140m dwellings in America each uniqueFragmentation chills trading activity The market for stocks is bustling AT&T shares change hands 40m times a day though some investors will hold for years and high-frequency traders might hold for less than a second Small-cap stocksrecent action in GameStop asidetend to trade less frequentlyBonds are stickier and dearer to trade Even the most liquid of AT&T bonds only trades a few hundred times a day “Some bonds are like museum pieces: they get put away in insurance companies’ portfolios never to trade again” says Richard Schiffman of MarketAxess a trading platformAt the stickiest end is property A slice of real-estate investment is offered to the masses via listed trusts But the big investments managed by private-equity firms are open only to institutions like pension funds or wealthy individuals Houses too turn over slowly Buyers and sellers must be painstakingly matched Sellers in America pay a meaty 5-6% commission Just 5% of homes change hands a yearLow transaction volumes make it difficult to price assets The price of a share in AT&T can be arrived at instantly Some bonds like recently issued Treasuries are easy to price too Older issuances are trickier Traders either attempt to match a seller with a buyer or look at recent transactions in similar bonds as a guide Pricing property is a similar but more glacial processFragmentation long seemed a hurdle to making the bond market as rapid-fire as the stockmarket An institutional investor wanting to buy a bond would talk to two or three big banks or brokers that dominate the market But this is starting to change thanks in large part to open-ended fixed-income ETFs funds that hold diversified baskets of bonds These enhance price discovery and trading volumes in two waysAll the world a marketThe first is through their design Some of the fixed-income ETFs offered by BlackRock an asset manager have 8000 or more different bonds in them As demand for an ETF rises it begins to trade above the fair value of its component bonds ie at a premium “When one of our ETFs trades at a premium we expect to see creation activity” says Samara Cohen of BlackRock The firm works with a handful of marketmakers which have an incentive to expand the size of the ETF when it trades at a premium Jane Street Capital one such marketmaker might offer BlackRock a portfolio of 400 bonds to add to its ETF pushing the price back towards fair value Jane Street gets to keep the differenceit bought those 400 bonds at market price and sells them at the implied premium at which the ETF was trading When the ETF gets cheaper the reverse occurs Jane Street redeems units of the ETF for its component bonds at a discount and sells them for market prices again pocketing the spread All this activity which is increasingly automatic enhances price discoveryThe second effect is through the wider trading of an ETF Each time it trades a reference for its component parts is created which helps price other bonds And ETFs trade far more frequently than their components In March 2020 as volatility shook markets BlackRock biggest investment-grade corporate-bond ETF traded 90000 times a day The top five holdings of the fund traded just 37 times Price accuracy means lower trading costsa step towards frictionless marketsTrading technology is also improving MarketAxess was set up to make it easier for investors to contact all the big banks’ bond desks and brokerage firmsaround 20 firms in totalat once But the platform has since introduced open trading which functions almost like an exchange letting all participants interact with each other The result is that trading need not be solely dependent on banks for liquidity says Mr Schiffman Around a third of the transactions MarketAxess facilitates on its platform are such “all-to-all” transactionsThe next phase might be automating bond trading Overbond a fixed-income analytics firm consolidates trading data that it plugs into a machine-learning algorithm The algorithm finds recent transactions in similar bonds and spits out implied prices It was the arrival of fast serverless cloud computing that helped the algorithm mimic a human trader in real time says Vuk Magdelinic of OverbondIn less liquid assets like private equity and property the seeds of change have just been planted To smaller investors illiquidity can be a curse: nervous regulators try to restrict access to illiquid assets But for institutions it is a boon Private-equity pitch books chatter about the “illiquidity premium” their investments earn The result is that private markets hold appeal for certain types of investors that are willing and able to lock their money up but not others A quarter of university endowments and a sixth of sovereign-wealth funds’ capital are invested in them By contrast insurers and retail investors plough just 1% of their capital into private marketsAnd all the men and women tradersThis too could eventually change For one firms in private markets are beginning to create funds that can expand or shrink as they gain or lose clients an innovation that echoes that of bond ETFs Investors typically buy into private markets when a fund manager raises capital The capital is locked up for a decade or more and used to buy 20 or so companies or real-estate investments over several years But in January Hamilton Lane an asset manager launched a private-equity and private-credit fund that circumvents this dynamic by ditching the fundraising cycle“When a [private-equity] fund manager buys a company for their fund they may ask us to partner with them for the equity for the project” says Drew Schardt of Hamilton Lane This is a cheaper way of getting access he notes: direct or co-investment deals do not have any underlying fees attached to them These deals come along fairly regularly allowing the fund to grow with demand It can also shrink: the fund is structured so that its investments mature regularly They should do so at a rate of 20% a year fulfilling the limited redemptions the firm plans to offer It also plans to match those keen to exit the fund with others buying in using third-party valuationsOther startups want to go even further Regulation is helping them Only accredited investors can invest in property venture-capital funds or hedge funds “Accredited” once meant the rich those earning more than $200000 or worth more than $1m But a rule change in 2017 means that those with professional experience or knowledge are now eligible tooThis change has fuelled the growth of startups offering property investments to the masses One such firm is Cadre set up in 2014 Ryan Williams its co-founder who previously worked at Blackstone an alternative asset-manager wants to build an exchange for commercial property that allows people to trade stakes in buildings almost like a “digital stockmarket”Cadre finds an investment opportunity with a life of around five or seven years and lists it on its platform Investors can buy pieces of it through the site Every quarter rental income is paid out and investors can choose to cash out through a trading system “We provide a quarterly valuation for their investment and they can choose to sell all or some of their stake at a range of prices” says Mr Williams This secondary market typically clears quicklyLow fees are likely to be part of the draw Cadre charges a 1% fee on any cash deposited on the platform and an annual management fee of 15% This is just a quarter of what an investor might pay a traditional alternative-asset manager The firm clients include the establishment: Goldman Sachs a bank is spending $250m on behalf of its wealth-management clients But individuals are stepping in tooYieldstreet which was founded in 2015 offers property investments as well as those in snazzier alternatives like art marine finance such as the funding of container ships and private credit In 2015 the Securities and Exchange Commission changed its rules on “mini” initial public offerings IPOs increasing the amount that can be raised to $50m A clutch of firms have since listed artworks and classic carsEven in residential property the most sluggish and expensive market of all firms are using technology to improve efficiency “When we thought about what makes a properly functioning marketplace it all came down to price discovery and data” says Rich Barton the founder of Zillow an “i-buying” firm which acts like a marketmaker for houses After a decade gathering data on every home in America it can now plug a property characteristics into machine-learning algorithms to price them just as Mr Magdelinic plugs in characteristics of bonds Zillow buys homes based on the algorithm assessment taking them onto its balance-sheet It then sells these on its platformThere is evidence this is pushing down agents’ fees Commissions are dropping quickly in areas in which i-buyers operate A study by Mike DelPrete of the University of Colorado suggests that the fees i-buyers pay to buyers’ agents are falling In places such as Phoenix Dallas and Raleigh the fees paid to agents have dropped by around 05-1 percentage points in a little over a year In Atlanta they have fallen by half in just two yearsBring these developments across disparate markets together and it seems clear that technology is making it possible for liquidity price transparency and competition to crop up in a variety of financial markets True the markets for art bonds and houses will never be quite as frictionless as the stockmarket Mr Schiffman thinks Tesla bonds are unlikely to be as exciting as its shares The clue is in the name “It is fixed income!” he laughs No one will make a snap decision to buy or sell a housebecause they have to live in itThey have their exits and entrancesYet the oncoming rush of liquidity should worry institutional investors Many help their customers gain exposure to a basket of small companies or to commercial property But that often comes as part of a pricey package deal: clients must also buy the slick advice that comes with it Once it became possible to buy exposure alone in the stockmarket many of them ditched their stock-pickersNow price transparency and liquidity seem bound to deliver fierce fee competition in other asset markets Retail investors may one day be able to stuff their cash into a portfolio of low-fee funds in everything from stocks and bonds to art and property It is this rather than gyrations in GameStop stock that will give retail investors more power over Wall Street Dig deeperThe real revolution on Wall StreetWhy the WallStreetBets crowd are able to profit from predatory tradingWhat the

 Feb 6th 2021,How should economists think about biodiversity?,WHAT IS THE contribution of nature to the economy? Students of economics are well acquainted with production functions which work out how inputs like capital and labour combine to yield output These functions make all sorts of assumptions many of which economists know well that the contributions of capital and labour are subject to diminishing returns say Others rarely get a thought: that a mix of inputs that generates output on Earth will not on Venus for example The breathable air drinkable water and tolerable temperatures that allow humans to do everything they do and the complex ecosystems that maintain them tend to be taken for granted This is more than a mere analytical oversight reckons a new report on the economics of biodiversity commissioned by the British government and produced by Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge By overlooking the role nature plays in economic activity economists underestimate the risks from environmental damage to growth and human welfareListen to this story Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or AndroidYour browser does not support the <audio> elementListen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKProfessor Dasgupta review is similar in spirit to a report on climate change by Nicholas Stern commissioned by Britain Treasury in 2006 and now widely regarded as a seminal economic work on the subject It does not seek to play on the heartstrings with tales of starving polar bears Rather it makes the hard-headed case that services provided by nature are an indispensable input to economic activity Some of these services are relatively easy to discern: fish stocks say in the open ocean Others are far less visible: such as the complex ecosystems within soil that recycle nutrients purify water and absorb atmospheric carbon These are unfamiliar topics for economists so the review seeks to provide a “grammar” through which they can be analysedThe report features its own illustrative production function which includes nature The environment appears once as a source of flows of extractable resources like fish or timber But it also shows up more broadly as a stock of “natural” capital from which humans derive “regulating and maintenance services”: the work of environmental cycles that refresh the air churn waste products into nutrients and keep global temperatures hospitable among other things With this new production function in hand economists can properly account for nature contributions to growth Functions that omit nature misattribute its benefits to productivity exaggerating human capabilitiesThe inclusion of natural capital enables an analysis of the sustainability of current rates of economic growth As people produce GDP they extract resources from nature and dump waste back into it If this extraction and dumping exceeds nature capacity to repair itself the stock of natural capital shrinks and with it the flow of valuable environmental services Between 1992 and 2014 according to a report published by the UN the value of produced capital such as machines and buildings roughly doubled and that of human capital workers and their skills rose by 13% while the estimated value of natural capital declined by nearly 40% The demands humans currently place on nature in terms of resource extraction and the dumping of harmful waste are roughly equivalent to the sustainable output of 16 Earths of which alas there is only the oneTo reduce these demands without slowing growth would be a monumental task Between 1992 and 2014 Professor Dasgupta estimates the efficiency with which humans transformed natural capital into GDP grew at about 35% a year To stop natural capital declining by 2030 while maintaining current growth trends however would require growth in efficiency of about 10% a yearEven these sorts of rough calculations fail to capture fully humans’ potential vulnerability because complex natural systems can flip from one equilibrium to another under pressure The cost of restoring an ecosystem that has been destroyed can be larger than the value of the services it provided when healthyassuming restoration is possible Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest beyond some critical threshold is likely to cause an abrupt transformation of the forest into savannah a change that may prove irreversible Indeed Professor Dasgupta argues that economists should acknowledge that there are in fact limits to growth As the efficiency with which we make use of Earth finite bounty is bounded by the laws of physics there is necessarily some maximum sustainable level of GDPThis is a striking admission from an economist For now these ultimate limits to growth are not yet binding There is still considerable room for efficiency to improve in part the review notes because of government subsidies worth 5-7% of global GDP which encourage environmentally wasteful activities But a more pressing worry is that activity pushes nature beyond critical thresholdsin terms of global temperatures the chemistry of the oceans the productivity of the soil or something elsebefore humans are able to recognise the danger and reactDown to earthThat economics stands to benefit from a better understanding of nature contributions to activity seems clear enough But whether a better understanding of the economics of biodiversity is essential to improving humans’ relationship with nature is another question Economists’ work on climate change has yielded insights for example but it is less clear that the profession has improved the policy responseProfessor Dasgupta hints at this problem by appealing to the “sacredness” of nature in addition to his mathematical models and analytical arguments Clear thinking about nature can benefit from framing it in economic terms: as an asset and input to production the overuse of which is a problem of incentives and property rights Building the political will to prevent irreparable damage to the environment though may require an appeal to values that are beyond the purview of economics For more coverage of climate change register for The Climate Issue our fortnightly newsletter or visit our

The predators are acting in concert so their strategy may be more effective Better still the prey are short-sellers who bet on stocks falling They are especially vulnerable: the more the price rises the more they lose Their potential losses are unlimited And their positions are often common knowledgeThis is why a lot of hedge funds put their trades through several brokers in an attempt to mask them Even so the incentive for brokers to front-run a struggling customer is hard to resistand not always resisted as Mr Cramer recounts in his book “There was something about a dying client that sent these brokers to go to the untapped pay phone downstairsall brokerage calls are recordedand tell their buddies” There really are no loyalties on Wall StreetDig deeperThe real revolution on Wall StreetA new epoch for retail investors is just beginningWhat the favourite stocks of r/wallstreetbets have in common
